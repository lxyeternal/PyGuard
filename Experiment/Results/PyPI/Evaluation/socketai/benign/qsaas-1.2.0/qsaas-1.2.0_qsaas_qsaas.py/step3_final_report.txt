  "purpose": "A Python class managing tenant API interactions, reading configs, and performing CRUD and async batch operations.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files or parameters; network requests via requests and aiohttp libraries.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests with JSON/multipart data; dynamic method invocation using eval().",
  "flows": "Uses eval() to invoke session methods like 'get', 'post', etc., based on string concatenation; network responses processed and paginated.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() for method calls, which is risky but controlled; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a standard API client with support for batch and async operations. eval() is used to dynamically call methods, which introduces a security concern but is controlled since method names are fixed. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The main risk stems from eval(), which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated, but as implemented, it is unlikely. No hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API client with some risky eval() usage but no malicious intent or malicious code detected. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0 and obfuscation score of 0. The primary concern is the eval() pattern, which should be refactored for safer practice. The supply chain security is minimal, and the code appears benign.",
