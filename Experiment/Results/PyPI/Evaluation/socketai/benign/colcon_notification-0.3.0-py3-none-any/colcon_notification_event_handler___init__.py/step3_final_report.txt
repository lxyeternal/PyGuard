  "purpose": "The code reads input data or environment variables and performs standard processing or network communication without any malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external files, stdin",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writes, data processing outputs",
  "flows": "Sources (input/env) to sinks (network/file/output)",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code structures observed",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate straightforward code with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the descriptions. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited or minimal code snippets. No evidence suggests malicious activity or obfuscation, and the low risk scores reflect a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no detectable malware or obfuscation. The assessments across reports are consistent and justified. The overall security posture is very low risk, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a risk score around 0.1, indicating minimal residual uncertainty.",
