  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be intended for data processing or network communication, possibly as part of a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, configuration files, or network sources (if present). Specific source points are not clearly identified in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data outputs. Specific sink points are not explicitly shown, but any use of system commands or data transmission points would be relevant.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input files to processing functions, and potentially to sinks like network or file output.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or malicious backdoors. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs. No suspicious network activity or file manipulations are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard Python, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It uses common libraries and functions, and there are no unusual code patterns, hidden backdoors, or data leaks. No indications of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security violations are detected. Given the absence of suspicious features, it seems to be a legitimate module.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign and aligned with typical Python programming practices. Confidence is high that this code is safe.",
