  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no explicit purpose provided. Without additional context, it is difficult to determine its intended function.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, file inputs, and possibly user inputs (if present). Specific source points are not clearly visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or system commands if present. No explicit sinks are visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "The data flow from sources to sinks cannot be fully mapped due to lack of concrete code; however, if environment variables or input files are read and their data is sent over network or written to files, those would constitute source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or obfuscated code are evident. The code does not contain unusual language features or dynamic execution techniques. No backdoors or malicious behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code does not display typical malicious indicators such as hardcoded secrets, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity. It appears to be a straightforward script without suspicious constructs. Since the code is missing detailed content, the review is limited to structural observations. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or significant security risks. The code seems benign but limited information prevents a definitive assessment. Confidence in this conclusion is moderate.",
