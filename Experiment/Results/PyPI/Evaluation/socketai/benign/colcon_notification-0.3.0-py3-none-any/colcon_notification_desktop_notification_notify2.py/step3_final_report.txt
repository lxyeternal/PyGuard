  "purpose": "Implement a desktop notification extension using 'notify2' to display notifications with specified title, message, and icon.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'title', 'message', 'icon_path' passed to notify() method; import of 'notify2' within notify() method.",
  "sinks": "notify2.Notification's show() method displays notifications; no external sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Parameters flow from notify() method to notify2.Notification object, which then displays the notification.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard exception handling and dependency import.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured implementation of desktop notifications using 'notify2'. It dynamically imports the library, initializes notification system once, and updates or creates notifications based on internal state. No suspicious or malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or network activity are present. The notification content is passed directly, which is typical. No obfuscation or backdoors are detected. The exception handling is appropriate, and the code adheres to standard practices. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2, confidence=0.9-1, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of desktop notifications with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature and assign appropriate low scores. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
