  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a Windows-specific notification utility using the Win32 API.\n- It dynamically imports modules, creates a window class, and displays notifications.\n- The icon_path parameter is optional; if provided, it loads an icon from the filesystem.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or command execution is present.\n- Exception handling is used to prevent crashes.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code is evident.\n- The code appears to be a standard implementation for desktop notifications.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Windows notifications.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly states that the code is a standard notification implementation with no malicious behavior. The only minor concern is loading icons from external sources, which is typical and not malicious. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Score adjustments:**  \nNo change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Windows notifications.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nSimilarly, this report emphasizes that the code is straightforward, with no malicious intent. The use of icon_path could be exploited if untrusted, but that’s standard and not malicious.\n\n**Score adjustments:**  \nNo change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Windows notifications.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis aligns with the code's behavior. No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Score adjustments:**  \nNo change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Windows notifications.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments. No suspicious activity.\n\n**Score adjustments:**  \nNo change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Windows notifications.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (lower than others)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nSame conclusion. Slightly lower risk score (0.1) is reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and Final Estimations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern due to external icon loading, which is standard.\n\n**My overall assessment:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n- The code is a typical Windows notification utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The provided scores are appropriate.",
