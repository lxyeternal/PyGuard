  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose:** Legitimate notification extension for macOS, using external app.\n\n**Sources:** Reads system info, sys.path, module file location, process ID.\n\n**Sinks:** Executes 'open' via subprocess.run() with message and title.\n\n**Flow:** Input parameters -> command construction -> external invocation.\n\n**Anomalies:** No sanitization of message/title, but parameters are passed as list arguments, minimizing injection risk.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- The code is straightforward, invoking an external notification app with parameters.  \n- The message is encoded and passed as an argument, not via shell string concatenation, reducing command injection risk.  \n- No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration present.  \n- The only concern could be if message contains malicious content, but since it's passed as an argument, the risk is minimal.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- No malicious activity.  \n- Malware score: **0** (correct).  \n- Security risk: **0.2** (low).  \n- Obfuscated: **0**.\n\n**Score adjustment:**  \n- The report's scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose:** Similar to report 1, providing macOS notifications via external app.\n\n**Sources:** Reads system info, sys.path, module file location, process ID.\n\n**Sinks:** Executes 'open' with message and title.\n\n**Flow:** Inputs influence command-line arguments; minimal sanitization.\n\n**Anomalies:** No suspicious hardcoded credentials or obfuscation.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- The code constructs commands to invoke an external notification app.  \n- Potential risk if input parameters are untrusted, but in typical use, these are controlled.  \n- No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- No signs of malware.  \n- Malware score: **0**.  \n- Security risk: **0.2**.\n\n**Score adjustment:**  \n- Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose:** Notification extension, locating external app, executing via subprocess.\n\n**Sources:** Path manipulations, system info, process ID.\n\n**Sinks:** Executes 'open' with parameters.\n\n**Flow:** Finds app path, constructs command, runs it.\n\n**Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, relies on external app integrity.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- Standard pattern for invoking external app.  \n- No malicious code or backdoors.  \n- External app could be compromised, but the code itself is benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- No malicious activity.  \n- Malware score: **0**.  \n- Security risk: **0.2**.\n\n**Score adjustment:**  \n- Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose:** MacOS notification via external app.\n\n**Sources:** System info, sys.path, package paths.\n\n**Sinks:** subprocess.run() with 'open'.\n\n**Flow:** Path determination -> command construction -> execution.\n\n**Anomalies:** Minimal sanitization, but standard practice.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity.  \n- External app integrity is a concern but outside the scope of code analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- No malware.  \n- Malware score: **0**.  \n- Security risk: **0.2**.\n\n**Score adjustment:**  \n- Seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose:** macOS notification extension, using external app.\n\n**Sources:** Environment inspection, sys.path, module file.\n\n**Sinks:** subprocess.run() with 'open'.\n\n**Flow:** Path checks -> command construction -> execution.\n\n**Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no suspicious code.\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- Standard notification pattern.  \n- No malicious intent or malicious code detected.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- No malware.  \n- Malware score: **0**.  \n- Security risk: **0.1** (very low).\n\n**Score adjustment:**  \n- Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns mainly about untrusted input handling, which is typical for notification scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate**\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity or backdoors are evident.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal security concern, mainly about input sanitization, which is acceptable in this context.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a legitimate macOS notification extension with no malicious behavior. The minor security concern about input sanitization does not elevate the risk significantly. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
