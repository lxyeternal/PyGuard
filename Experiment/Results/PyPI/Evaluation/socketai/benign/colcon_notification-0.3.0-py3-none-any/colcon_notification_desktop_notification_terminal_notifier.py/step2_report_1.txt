  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the potential security implications, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code is for macOS notifications, reading system info and module paths.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The subprocess runs an external app with message content passed as arguments.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The report notes that message content is passed directly to subprocess arguments, but since subprocess.run() is used with a list, command injection risk is minimal. No malicious behavior or backdoors are detected.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis. The security risk is low (0.2), consistent with the report.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning is sound. No changes needed. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's function and data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Potential risk if input parameters are influenced by untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code doesn't sanitize inputs but does not perform dangerous operations like code execution or network activity. The risk is mainly if external input is malicious, which is typical for notification scripts.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate. The security risk is low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is accurate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code's purpose.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External app invocation via subprocess, with message and title passed as arguments.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious intent or suspicious code patterns. The external app's integrity is the main concern, but the code itself is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware score 0 is appropriate; the overall risk is low.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-reasoned, scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External app invoked with user-supplied data, but sanitization is minimal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is standard for notification purposes.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware score of 0 matches the analysis; low security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** External command execution with parameters derived from environment and code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The subprocess call is safe given the context.\n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.1, aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, assigning 0.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above 0.1 but below 0.5, reflecting minimal security concern, mainly about input handling but no actual exploitation observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** **0.2** — minor potential concern due to input passing, but no actual vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and well-reasoned. The code is a standard implementation for macOS notifications with no malicious intent. The scores are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**My recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis reflects a low-security concern with no malware or obfuscation present.",
