{
  "purpose": "The code manages desktop notifications for build/test events, updating internal flags based on stderr output, test failures, and job completion status, then notifying the user accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads event data such as StderrLine, TestFailure, JobEnded, and environment info via os.getcwd().",
  "sinks": "Calls notify() function to display desktop notifications based on event processing.",
  "flows": "Event data is processed to set flags; upon shutdown, notifications are generated based on the accumulated state.",
  "anomalies": "Use of format_map(self.__dict__) could be risky if self.__dict__ contains untrusted data, but in this context, it is controlled internal state.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward event handler that updates internal flags based on event types and issues notifications during shutdown. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The logic is standard, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The use of format_map is safe here given the context. No network activity or data exfiltration is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard event-driven desktop notifications without any signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores are justified, and there is no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
