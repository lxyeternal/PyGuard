{
  "purpose": "The code implements a status event handler for a command-line tool, providing real-time progress updates and handling various event types related to job execution.",
  "sources": "Reads system output streams (stdout, stderr), event objects such as JobQueued, JobStarted, JobProgress, JobEnded, TimerEvent, and EventReactorShutdown.",
  "sinks": "Prints formatted status messages to stdout, particularly in response to TimerEvent and other job events, overwriting the last line for dynamic updates.",
  "flows": "Event data is received and classified; progress information is extracted from stdout lines; job states are tracked; status messages are generated and printed to the terminal, including runtime, job count, and progress details.",
  "anomalies": "The code modifies sys.stdout.write and sys.stderr.write to clear the last status line before writing, which is a common technique for dynamic terminal updates and not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. The code does not contain network access, file manipulations beyond standard imports, or obscure dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior detected. All operations are related to event handling and output formatting.",
  "analysis": "The script provides real-time status updates for a command-line tool managing jobs, with standard event handling, progress parsing, and terminal output formatting. It employs regular expressions to parse progress indicators and manages terminal line overwriting for clean display. It registers an atexit handler to clean up terminal output upon exit. There are no indications of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors. Usage of standard libraries and patterns suggests legitimate functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign status display handler for a build or job management tool, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It employs typical patterns for terminal UI updates and event handling. No malicious intent or security risks are identified in this module.",
