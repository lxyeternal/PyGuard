  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard terminal progress display utility with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The scores in the reports are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be conservatively set at 0.1 due to stdout modifications, which are typical for such utilities."
