{
  "purpose": "Provides real-time progress updates for job execution, handling various job and timer events, and updating terminal output dynamically.",
  "sources": "Event objects such as JobQueued, JobStarted, JobProgress, StdoutLine, JobEnded, TimerEvent, EventReactorShutdown; reads event data and stdout/stderr output lines.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted status lines to stdout/stderr, overwriting previous lines for live updates.",
  "flows": "Event data flows from event triggers to stdout/stderr write functions, with regex parsing of stdout lines to extract progress info.",
  "anomalies": "Modifies sys.stdout.write and sys.stderr.write to clear last status line before printing new output, which is common in CLI UI code but unusual in typical scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard terminal UI component that updates progress status based on events, using regex to parse progress indicators, and manages terminal output dynamically. It does not perform network activity, file manipulation beyond standard imports, or contain obfuscation. Modifying stdout/stderr write methods is a known pattern for terminal progress bars. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code's purpose is benign, and it employs common patterns for CLI utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard terminal progress display utility with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The scores in the reports are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be conservatively set at 0.1 due to stdout modifications, which are typical for such utilities.",
