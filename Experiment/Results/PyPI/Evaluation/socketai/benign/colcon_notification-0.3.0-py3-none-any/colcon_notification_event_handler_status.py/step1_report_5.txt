{
  "purpose": "The code implements a status event handler for a command-line tool, providing real-time updates on job statuses and progress during a build or execution process.",
  "sources": "Reads event data from various imported event classes such as JobQueued, JobStarted, JobProgress, StdoutLine, JobEnded, TimerEvent, and EventReactorShutdown.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted status lines and progress updates to stdout/stderr; clears last status line to update terminal display.",
  "flows": "Event data (sources) are processed in the __call__ method, where based on event type, internal state is updated and status messages are constructed and printed to stdout/stderr.",
  "anomalies": "Code dynamically modifies sys.stdout.write, sys.stdout.buffer.write, sys.stderr.write, sys.stderr.buffer.write to clear status lines before writing output. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious file operations are present. No network or system modifications are detected. Regular expressions are used for progress pattern matching, which is normal. No obfuscation or misleading code features are identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard event handler designed to display progress updates in a terminal. It uses sys.stdout and sys.stderr manipulation to manage terminal output, which is common for such utilities. Event data is handled and stored in dictionaries, with no external network calls, file writes outside terminal output, or other suspicious activities. The use of atexit for cleanup and version checks aligns with standard practices. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are present. The code’s operations are solely for UI update purposes and do not perform any hidden or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign progress and status handler for a command-line application. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows. It primarily manipulates terminal output for user feedback. No security risks or malware are detected.",
