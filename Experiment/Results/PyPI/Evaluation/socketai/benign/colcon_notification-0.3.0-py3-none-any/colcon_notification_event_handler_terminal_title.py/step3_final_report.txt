  "purpose": "Update terminal title based on job events (queued, started, ended) with environment checks for terminal capabilities.",
  "sources": "sys.stdout, os.getenv('TERM'), event data (event[0])",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write, ctypes.windll.kernel32.SetConsoleTitleW",
  "flows": "Event data (JobQueued, JobStarted, JobEnded) -> counters update -> _update() -> terminal title via stdout or Windows API",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; environment checks are standard; platform-specific title update methods are typical.",
  "analysis": "The code manages terminal titles based on job events, using environment variables and system calls. It performs environment checks to avoid updating in non-interactive terminals. The platform-specific title update methods are standard. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or vulnerabilities. The environment checks and system calls are appropriate for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for updating terminal titles based on job events. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal platform-specific code but no threat. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
