{
  "purpose": "The code is a terminal event handler that updates the terminal title with job status information during execution.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (TERM), system info (platform.system()), and event data (event[0]) which contains JobQueued, JobStarted, or JobEnded objects.",
  "sinks": "Calls platform-specific functions to update the terminal title (_windows_update_title or _ascii_update_title), which write to stdout or system APIs.",
  "flows": "Event data (source) triggers count updates, which then lead to terminal title updates (sink) depending on system platform.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic system API calls for setting terminal titles, but no unusual or suspicious code is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes event handler with version satisfaction checks and terminal capability detection. It updates internal counters based on job events and reflects this in the terminal title. Environment variable 'TERM' is checked to determine if terminal title updates are enabled. The functions for updating the title are standard platform-specific implementations. No external data exfiltration, malicious code, or obfuscated logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign terminal UI enhancement for job status display. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are present.",
