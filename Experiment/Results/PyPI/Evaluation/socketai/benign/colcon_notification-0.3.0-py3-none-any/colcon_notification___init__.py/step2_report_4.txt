  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a minimal Python file that only contains licensing comments and a single assignment to `__version__`.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, or external interactions.\n- The code is straightforward and standard for package version declaration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on code presence:\n- **Issue presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code only contains a license comment and a version string assignment. There are no hidden or malicious code snippets.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports indicate any suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malware. This aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- **No flaws detected:** All reports correctly conclude that the code is benign and standard. The reasoning is consistent and well-founded given the minimal content.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All assign 0, which is justified given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is reasonable.\n\n### Risk score justification:\n- Since the code is only a version string with licensing comments, the security risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- No suspicious patterns, no external data handling, no obfuscation, and no malware activity are observed.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code's purpose.\n- The analysis is consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a straightforward, benign version declaration with licensing comments. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code content.",
