  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of comments, a license notice, and a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no input sources, data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code appears to be a standard metadata snippet used in Python packages.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No reports identify any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n   - The code is straightforward and minimal, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious content.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Logical Flaws:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No report overstates the risk; all assign a score of 0 for malware and security risk, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a typical, harmless version declaration snippet.\n   - The scores are reasonable and well-justified.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The scores reflect the actual risk level correctly.",
