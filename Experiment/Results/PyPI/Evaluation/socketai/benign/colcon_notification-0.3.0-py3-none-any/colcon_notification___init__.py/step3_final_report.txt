  "purpose": "Declare package version with licensing comments",
  "sources": "None; only comments and a version string assignment",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external communication",
  "flows": "None; static assignment without data flow",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal, standard, with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and a single assignment of __version__ = '0.3.0'. There are no input sources, external data handling, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1, reflecting the simplicity and harmless nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign version declaration with licensing comments. No malicious or suspicious elements are present. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
