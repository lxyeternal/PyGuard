{
  "purpose": "Constructs a path to the 'lib' directory relative to the current file, used for locating solver libraries within the package.",
  "sources": "The `__file__` attribute and `os.path.dirname(__file__)` functions, which read the current file's path.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only constructs a file path without writing, executing, or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "From `__file__` to `os.path.dirname()`, then to `os.path.join()` to create the directory path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, uses standard library functions, and performs a common resource location task.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module, then constructs a path to a 'lib' directory located relative to the current file using `os.path.dirname(__file__)` and `os.path.join()`. It does not process untrusted input, execute code, or perform network operations. The purpose is to locate resource libraries within the package environment. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity are consistent with its intended function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard resource location task without any malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No further modifications or concerns are necessary.",
