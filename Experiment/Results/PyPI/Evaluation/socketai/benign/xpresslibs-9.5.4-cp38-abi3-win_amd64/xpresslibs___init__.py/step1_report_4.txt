  "purpose": "To locate the solver libraries within the package directory on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __file__ attribute to determine the current file's directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data influences security-critical operations.",
  "flows": "The code constructs a file path using the current file's directory and a subdirectory named 'lib'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a straightforward directory path construction with no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module, then constructs a path to the 'lib' directory relative to the current file. It uses __file__ to dynamically determine its location, which is a common pattern. No external inputs, user data, or untrusted sources are involved. The purpose is solely to locate library files in a known subdirectory. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple path construction to locate library files. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
