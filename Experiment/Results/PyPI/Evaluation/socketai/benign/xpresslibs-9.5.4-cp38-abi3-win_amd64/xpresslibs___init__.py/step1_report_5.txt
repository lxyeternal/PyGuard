  "purpose": "Locate solver libraries within the package directory on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Reading the current file's directory using __file__ and os.path.dirname.",
  "sinks": "Constructing a path to a 'lib' directory, potential for further use in loading libraries.",
  "flows": "The directory path derived from __file__ flows into the variable 'solver_libs_dir', which can be used for library loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies present; the code is straightforward and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, constructs a path to a 'lib' folder relative to its current file location. It is designed for library location purposes on Windows. No input validation, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is simple and serves a utility function. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility snippet for locating library files within the package structure. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
