  "purpose": "To locate solver libraries within the package directory on Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Reading the current file's directory (__file__) and constructing a path to a 'lib' subdirectory.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or sensitive information; the code only constructs a file path.",
  "flows": "Source: __file__ (the current script's path) -> Flow: os.path.dirname(__file__) -> Sink: os.path.join to create 'lib' directory path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward path construction with no obfuscated or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code determines the directory of the current script file and appends a 'lib' folder to locate solver libraries. This is typical package setup code intended for locating resources. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code's simplicity and clarity suggest it performs its intended purpose without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign resource locator used within the package to find necessary solver libraries. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
