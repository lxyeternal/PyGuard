  "sources": "DataFrame input (`df`), numpy functions for array operations.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no code writes to external systems, executes commands, or handles untrusted input in a dangerous way.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> nullity_sort/nullity_filter functions -> processed DataFrame output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution detected. The code uses standard numpy and pandas operations for data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two utility functions for pandas DataFrames. It uses standard data processing methods—sorting and filtering based on nullity metrics. No external network calls, no execution of untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious variable manipulations are present. The functions perform straightforward array and DataFrame operations. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions with no malicious intent. It safely manipulates DataFrames based on nullity metrics. There are no signs of malware or security risks in this code.",
