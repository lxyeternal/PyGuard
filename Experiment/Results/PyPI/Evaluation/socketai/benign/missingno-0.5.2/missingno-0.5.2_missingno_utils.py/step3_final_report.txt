  "purpose": "Utility functions for sorting and filtering pandas DataFrames based on nullity metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads DataFrame input; uses df.count() for nullity metrics; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> nullity calculations -> sorting/filtering operations -> output DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard pandas and numpy operations for sorting and filtering DataFrames based on nullity. It includes parameter validation and straightforward logic. No external calls, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns are present. The functions are utility routines with benign intent, and the code is clear and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and free of malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
