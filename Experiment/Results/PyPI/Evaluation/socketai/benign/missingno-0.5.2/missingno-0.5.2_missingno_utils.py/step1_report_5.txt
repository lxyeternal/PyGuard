  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling missing data in DataFrames, including sorting and filtering based on nullity.",
  "sources": "Reads DataFrame objects (df), computes nullity metrics, and performs sorting and filtering operations using numpy and pandas.",
  "sinks": "DataFrame operations, primarily in-memory data manipulation; no evident data leaks or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> nullity calculations and sorting/filtering logic -> Output DataFrame with sorted or filtered nullity-based data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs observed. Code performs standard data processing tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions for sorting and filtering pandas DataFrames based on nullity information, using numpy for sorting indices. It handles parameter validation and performs common data manipulations. No code injection, external data transmission, or malicious behavior detected. The logic is straightforward, with standard use of pandas and numpy functions. No anomalies like hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation present. The functions are designed for data analysis workflows, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for DataFrame nullity operations with no malicious or security-compromising elements. It is safe and intended for legitimate data processing purposes.",
