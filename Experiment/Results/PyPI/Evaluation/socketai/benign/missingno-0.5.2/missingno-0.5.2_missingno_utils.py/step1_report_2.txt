  "purpose": "Utility functions for sorting and filtering pandas DataFrames based on nullity and completeness.",
  "sources": "Inputs include DataFrame objects (`df`) and function parameters (`sort`, `filter`, `p`, `n`). No external or untrusted data sources are explicitly read in this code.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are modified DataFrames returned by the functions. No data is written to external systems, files, or network connections within this code.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> function logic (sorting or filtering) -> return modified DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears straightforward and consistent with typical pandas operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for sorting (`nullity_sort`) and filtering (`nullity_filter`) DataFrames based on nullity or completeness metrics. It uses numpy for index sorting and pandas' iloc for data selection. The functions include parameter validation but do not execute any external commands or access external resources. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detectable. The code operates purely on DataFrame data and does not include any hidden or obfuscated segments. All logic aligns with common data processing patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard utility functions for DataFrame manipulation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic data filtering and sorting without any external side effects or suspicious behaviors.",
