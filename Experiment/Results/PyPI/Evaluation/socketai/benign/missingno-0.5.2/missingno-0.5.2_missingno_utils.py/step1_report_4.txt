  "purpose": "Utility functions for sorting and filtering pandas DataFrames based on nullity.",
  "sources": "Reads from DataFrame objects passed as parameters; uses numpy for array operations.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from functions; no external data sinks or untrusted output handling present.",
  "flows": "DataFrame inputs are processed through sorting/filtering functions with internal numpy operations; no external or network data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. Functions perform standard data processing tasks without hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two functions: nullity_sort and nullity_filter, which sort and filter DataFrames based on nullity. The logic relies on numpy for index calculations and pandas for data slicing. There are no external data injections, network operations, or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data handling detected. The code appears to be a standard utility module for data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for DataFrame manipulation with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It simply sorts and filters data based on nullity metrics without engaging in any malicious activity.",
