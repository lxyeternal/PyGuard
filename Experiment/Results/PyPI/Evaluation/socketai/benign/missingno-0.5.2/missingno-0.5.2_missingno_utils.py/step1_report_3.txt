  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for sorting and filtering pandas DataFrames based on nullity and completeness.",
  "sources": "Reads the input DataFrame 'df' for processing, and numpy functions for array manipulations.",
  "sinks": "Uses DataFrame indexing with iloc based on computed boolean or index arrays; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame is processed through nullity-based sorting and filtering functions, resulting in modified DataFrame outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements nullity-based sorting and filtering of pandas DataFrames using numpy for array operations. It validates parameters, performs index-based DataFrame reordering, and filtering based on nullity ratios or counts. All operations are standard pandas/numpy procedures. No external data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden backdoors are present. Functions operate solely on DataFrame objects with in-memory data. The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for data preprocessing without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard DataFrame sorting and filtering functions for nullity analysis. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The functions are typical utility routines without harmful side effects.",
