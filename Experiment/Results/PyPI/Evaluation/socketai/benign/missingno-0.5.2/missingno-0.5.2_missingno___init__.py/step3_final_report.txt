  "purpose": "Import visualization functions and version info from the 'missingno' package and internal modules for data visualization or analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'missingno' package and internal utility modules, including version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static imports without data flow or execution.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate import of 'nullity_filter' and 'nullity_sort' in the last line; otherwise straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a known package and internal modules, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The duplicate import is redundant but not malicious. The code appears to be part of a package's __init__.py or setup module, typical for a visualization library. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected. The import statements are standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The import statements are straightforward and typical for a Python package setup. The duplicate import is minor and does not impact security. Overall, the code is safe and non-malicious.",
