{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that imports various visualization and utility functions related to missing data analysis from the 'missingno' library and internal modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.missingno' and '._version', and functions 'nullity_filter' and 'nullity_sort' from '.utils'.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit data sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system commands. Imports do not pose an immediate risk.",
  "flows": "The imported functions are used within the package; no data flow analysis is applicable here as no execution code is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are evident. The code consists solely of import statements, which are typical for module initialization.",
  "analysis": "This code fragment imports functions and variables from local modules related to missing data visualization and utility functions. There are no dynamic executions, user inputs, or suspicious patterns. The imports are standard for organizing package modules. No malicious behavior, such as network activity, code injection, or backdoors, is present in these statements.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import section of a Python package module with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The code is straightforward and intended to include functions for missing data visualization and utilities.",
