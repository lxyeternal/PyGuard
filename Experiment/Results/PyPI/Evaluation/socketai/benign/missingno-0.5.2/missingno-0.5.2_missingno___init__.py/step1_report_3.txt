{
  "purpose": "The code imports various functions from a module named 'missingno' and some utility functions, likely to be used for data visualization and processing within a larger data analysis package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'missingno' submodules and '_version', 'utils' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; the code only performs imports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports functions and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code contains straightforward import statements with no dynamic execution or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of static import statements from local modules. There is no input handling, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. It imports visualization and utility functions, which are standard for a data analysis library. The presence of multiple imports from the same module suggests modular organization but does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of import statements for a data visualization and utility library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe based on this fragment.",
