{
  "purpose": "This code imports functions and variables from a local package named 'missingno' and utility modules, likely for data visualization or data analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements accessing local modules and functions within the package, such as 'missingno' functions and version info.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code only performs imports without executing untrusted data or performing actions that lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code strictly imports modules and functions, which does not involve untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, including visualization functions, version info, and utility functions. There is no execution of untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All imports are from local modules, indicating standard package structure. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detectable based on these import statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical set of import statements from a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated code. Overall, it is safe.",
