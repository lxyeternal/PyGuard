  "purpose": "Unit tests for visualization functions in the missingno library, generating synthetic data to verify plotting outputs.",
  "sources": "Synthetic data generated internally via numpy and pandas; no external or untrusted inputs.",
  "sinks": "Visualization functions rendering plots; no data leaks or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Data from numpy/pandas into visualization functions, with plots generated locally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard unit tests for visualization routines, using synthetic data with fixed seeds for reproducibility. No external data, network activity, or malicious code is present. The functions are called with various parameters to test different visualization configurations. The figures are retrieved via plt.gcf() and returned for comparison. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The data is generated locally, and the code's purpose is purely testing visualization outputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward test suite for visualization functions, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.",
