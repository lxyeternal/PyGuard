  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string assigned to __version__.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment in code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string '0.5.2' to __version__, a common practice for version declaration. It contains no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activities are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign and standard. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident. The code does not perform any network, file, or dynamic operations. The overall assessment confirms the benign nature of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
