  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only",
  "anomalies": "Simple version assignment; no unusual or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string value to the '__version__' variable, indicating the package version. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. The code appears to be a standard version declaration commonly found in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical version declaration statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
