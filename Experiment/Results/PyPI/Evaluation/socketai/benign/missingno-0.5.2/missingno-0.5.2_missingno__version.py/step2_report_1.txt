  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is minimal and typical for version declaration in Python packages.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The assessments correctly identify the code as standard version declaration.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - The overall confidence is 1, which is justified.\n   - **Suggestion:** No score adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0, indicating no risk.\n   - Since the code is purely a version string assignment, this is appropriate.\n   - **No justification needed for higher scores.**\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 across reports is correct.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores align with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall recommendation:\n\nThe code snippet is a standard version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed. The code is safe, and the reports correctly reflect its benign nature.",
