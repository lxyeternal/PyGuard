  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment to __version__ variable; no input reading or data fetching.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or external effect.",
  "flows": "None; the code only assigns a static string value.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; only version assignment, no anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string value '0.5.2' to the variable __version__, which is a common practice for specifying package versions. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows. No suspicious or malicious behavior is indicated by this snippet alone. The simplicity suggests it's a standard version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It is typical in open-source packages for versioning purposes.",
