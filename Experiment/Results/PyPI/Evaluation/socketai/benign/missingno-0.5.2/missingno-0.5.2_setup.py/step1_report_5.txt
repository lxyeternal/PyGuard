{
  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'missingno' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Constants and literals within the setup() function, such as package name, license, dependencies, author info, and URLs.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or user input, nor data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no suspicious or unusual code structures, no hardcoded secrets beyond standard metadata, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to configure a Python package. It specifies package name, license, dependencies, author details, URLs, and other metadata. All values are static and sourced from constants or literals. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data handling is present. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical and benign setup configuration script for a Python package. No malicious intent, no security risks identified. The script merely provides package metadata and dependencies.",
