{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'missingno' Python package, intended to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Input data from package parameters (name, license, packages, etc.), static code variables, and external URLs.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or output functions that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or external systems; setup parameters are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated patterns; straightforward setup configuration without suspicious logic or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script uses 'setuptools' to define package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All data are hardcoded strings and lists, with no dynamic or untrusted input handling. No code injection, network activity, or hidden behaviors are present. URLs point to legitimate GitHub resources for the package source. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for open-source package distribution.",
