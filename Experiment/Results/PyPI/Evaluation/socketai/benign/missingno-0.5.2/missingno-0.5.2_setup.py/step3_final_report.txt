  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for the 'missingno' Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static strings and lists defining package name, license, packages, dependencies, URLs, author info, and keywords.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script employing setuptools to specify package details, dependencies, URLs, and author info. It contains only static, hardcoded data with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or obfuscation. All signals point to a benign, well-structured package configuration. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security risks are present. The URLs and author info are legitimate and publicly available. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code content and structure. The high confidence scores are justified given the static and transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify it as safe, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
