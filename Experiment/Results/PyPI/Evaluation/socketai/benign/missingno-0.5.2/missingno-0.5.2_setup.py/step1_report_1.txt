  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup parameters for the missingno Python package.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily from static strings and package metadata; no dynamic input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform data output or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative and configuration-based.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code follows standard Python packaging conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration script for a Python package, using setuptools to specify package details, dependencies, author info, and URLs. It contains no dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior is apparent. The code structure is straightforward and aligns with common practices for Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and typical for open-source Python package distribution.",
