  "sources": "DataFrame setup in setUp methods, usage of msno.nullity_sort and msno.nullity_filter functions.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to msno.nullity_sort and msno.nullity_filter, which process DataFrames.",
  "flows": "DataFrames created in setUp -> passed as arguments to msno functions -> results compared for correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. Use of external library missingno is standard for data visualization/analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard unit testing code that creates sample DataFrames, invokes utility functions, and asserts expected outcomes. No input from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated or malicious code. The code simply tests the behavior of utility functions, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical unit test suite for data utility functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The presence of test cases and assertions appears entirely benign.",
