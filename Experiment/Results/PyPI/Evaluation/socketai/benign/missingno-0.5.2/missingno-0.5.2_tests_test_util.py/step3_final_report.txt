  "purpose": "Unit tests for missingno's nullity_sort and nullity_filter functions, verifying their correctness with pandas DataFrames.",
  "sources": "DataFrame creation within test cases; no external data or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; all operations are in-memory assertions.",
  "flows": "DataFrames are manipulated and tested locally; no external data flow or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with standard testing patterns and no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of standard unit tests for pandas DataFrame functions, with no external data sources, network activity, or system commands. It uses common libraries and a local import. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The tests perform in-memory data manipulations and assertions, indicating benign behavior. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code's purpose is purely to verify data manipulation functions, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured unit test suite for pandas utility functions. There are no indicators of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
