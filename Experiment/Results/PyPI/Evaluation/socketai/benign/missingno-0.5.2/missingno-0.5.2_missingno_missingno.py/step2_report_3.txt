  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk, while ensuring the technical details align with a benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides visualization tools for nullity analysis, relying on standard libraries. It mentions the imported `.utils` functions but assumes they are standard filtering/sorting utilities.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external code execution. The report correctly notes the limited insight into `.utils`.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** The report assigns a malware score of 0, which is reasonable given no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Overall Security Risk:** Low (0.1), consistent with benign data visualization code.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues. The code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard data visualization routines, no external communication or malicious behaviors.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malicious code, code injection, or suspicious activity.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Overall Security Risk:** Very low (0), appropriate for benign visualization code.\n\n**Conclusion:** No concerns; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on nullity and correlation visualization, standard libraries, no external data leaks.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malicious behaviors detected.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Overall Security Risk:** Slightly higher at 0.1, but still negligible.\n\n**Conclusion:** Safe, with no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar assessment—standard data analysis and visualization routines, no external data transmission.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No suspicious code patterns or malicious behaviors.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is justified.\n- **Overall Security Risk:** Very low (0.1).\n\n**Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard visualization functions with no signs of malicious activity, relying on common libraries.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, or external communication.\n- **Risk Score Justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Overall Security Risk:** No significant risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as no malicious activity, code injection, or external communication is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** The low scores (around 0.1 to 0.2) are justified, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — negligible security risk, typical for data visualization code.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately cautious. The code is a standard, benign data visualization utility with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
