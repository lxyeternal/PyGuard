{
  "purpose": "The code provides various visualization functions for analyzing nullity patterns and correlations in pandas DataFrames, including matrix, bar, heatmap, and dendrogram visualizations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from pandas DataFrames, including data filtering, sorting, and index/column labels. It also imports standard libraries for visualization and numerical operations. No external untrusted input sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily produces plots using matplotlib and seaborn; it does not write data externally or execute system commands. No sinks indicating malicious data exfiltration or system modification are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from DataFrame inputs through filtering, sorting, and calculations (e.g., nullity, correlation, hierarchical linkage) into visualization functions, which generate plots but do not send or store untrusted data outside the plotting context.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code strictly performs data filtering, statistical calculations, and plotting. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variables are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script implements standard data analysis and visualization routines using pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scipy. It applies filtering and sorting to data, computes nullity and correlation matrices, hierarchical clustering, and renders various plots. All operations are typical for data visualization purposes. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage is observed. No dangerous functions or external calls are used.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data visualization module focused on nullity and correlation analysis of DataFrames. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks. It is safe for use in data analysis workflows.",
