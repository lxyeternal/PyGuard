  "purpose": "The code provides multiple visualization functions for analyzing nullity and missing data patterns in pandas DataFrames, including matrix, bar, heatmap, and dendrogram visualizations.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrame (df) via function parameters; external utilities imported from '.utils' such as nullity_filter and nullity_sort.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no code writes untrusted data, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input DataFrame -> Filtering and sorting functions -> Visualization plotting functions -> Matplotlib/Seaborn rendering; no external data flows or untrusted sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. Use of standard libraries and typical plotting code is observed. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or hidden malicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines visualization functions utilizing common Python data analysis libraries (numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy). It calls external utilities (nullity_filter, nullity_sort) that are assumed to be safe. No network, file, or system modifications are performed. The functions include plotting routines with standard practices, with no dynamic execution or suspicious code patterns. No malicious signals or behaviors are detected. The code appears to be well-structured, straightforward, and focused on data visualization.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of visualization tools for DataFrame nullity analysis with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It uses common libraries and standard patterns without any suspicious or harmful activity. The overall security risk is negligible.",
