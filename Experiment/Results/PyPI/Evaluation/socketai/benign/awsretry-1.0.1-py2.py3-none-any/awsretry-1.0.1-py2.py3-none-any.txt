      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, incomplete AWS retry utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The incomplete method implementations are a correctness issue but do not introduce security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are appropriate and should be maintained. Proper implementation of the placeholder methods would restore full functionality without altering the security assessment."
