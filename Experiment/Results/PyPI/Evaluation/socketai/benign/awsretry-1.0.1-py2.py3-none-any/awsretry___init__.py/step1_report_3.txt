  "purpose": "Provides a retry mechanism for AWS API calls based on exception handling and response codes.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include exceptions raised during AWS API calls, particularly botocore and boto exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve logging via syslog and retries of AWS API calls. No untrusted data output or external network transmission is directly observed.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are caught during API call retries, and based on their type and code, retries are scheduled. No data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions beyond exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains unimplemented methods (base_class, status_code_from_exception, found) which are placeholders; no immediate anomalies are visible but suggest incomplete implementation. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for retry logic based on AWS API exceptions, with methods to determine exception types, extract error codes, and decide whether to retry. The retry mechanism employs exponential backoff. The methods are not fully implemented; however, the overall structure aligns with standard retry patterns. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft are present. Usage of syslog for logging is standard and controlled. The code does not access or leak sensitive data, nor does it execute untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to implement a standard, benign AWS retry mechanism with placeholder methods. No malicious intent or malicious behavior is detected. The code is incomplete but structurally normal, with no signs of security risks.",
