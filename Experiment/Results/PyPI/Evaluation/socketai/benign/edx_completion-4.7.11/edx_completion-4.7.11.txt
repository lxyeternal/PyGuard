      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with minimal security concerns. The only notable risk stems from executing shell commands via os.system based on command-line input, which is controlled here. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The overall security risk is low, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero."

It aligns with the reports' assessments, which correctly assign a malware score of 0 and low risk scores (~0.1-0.2). The overall security posture is very low risk, and the code can be considered safe for supply chain purposes."

Minor variations in security risk scores (e.g., 0.1) are acceptable but could be lowered to 0. given the benign analysis."

Overall, the code poses no security threat."
