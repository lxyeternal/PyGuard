  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with minimal security concerns. The only notable risk stems from executing shell commands via os.system based on command-line input, which is controlled here. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The overall security risk is low, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero."
