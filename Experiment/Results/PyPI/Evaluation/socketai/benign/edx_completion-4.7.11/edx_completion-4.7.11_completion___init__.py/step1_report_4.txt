{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a minimal module, possibly part of a larger application, with a version attribute.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code only defines a string attribute.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hidden code, or obfuscated segments; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a docstring comment and a single version variable assignment. It does not include any functions, input/output operations, external library calls, or suspicious constructs. The content is standard and non-malicious. Given the simplicity, there are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving likely as a version identifier for a larger application. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are present.",
