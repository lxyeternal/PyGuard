  "purpose": "Provide utilities, factories, and test mixins for testing completion tracking functionality within a Django application.",
  "sources": "Import statements, functions, class definitions, and method implementations related to test setup, user creation, waffle switch overrides, event tracking, and in-memory backend.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code mainly interacts with test data, in-memory storage, and configuration settings.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks; code is for testing setup and in-memory event recording.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is standard for testing purposes, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines test utilities, including user factory, waffle switch override, completion setup, and an in-memory event backend. It uses standard testing practices with no signs of malicious behavior. There are no dynamic code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The in-memory backend is safe and intended for testing. All interactions are confined to testing contexts and do not involve untrusted input handling beyond standard test data creation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is solely intended for testing and setup within a Django application. It contains no malicious intent or behavior. The use of in-memory data structures and standard testing libraries pose no security threats.",
