  "conclusion": "The code is safe, intended solely for testing, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score. For consistency, the slight security risk in one report can be adjusted to 0. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
