{
  "purpose": "The code provides testing utilities, factories, waffle switch overrides, and in-memory event tracking for Django-based completion tracking tests.",
  "sources": "Test setup methods, factory classes, waffle switch override functions, in-memory event backend, and test case classes.",
  "sinks": "Database models (BlockCompletion), in-memory event list, and test environment variables; no external untrusted data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Test functions and mixins set waffle switches and create test data; data flows into in-memory backend or database models within controlled test scope.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of waffle switches and in-memory storage are standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is strictly for testing purposes, utilizing standard Django testing utilities, factories, and in-memory data stores. No external data flows, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The waffle switch overrides are confined to test environments, and no secrets or backdoors are evident. The minimal security risk score (0.1) in one report is appropriate but could be lowered to 0, given the absence of vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, intended solely for testing, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score. For consistency, the slight security risk in one report can be adjusted to 0. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
