{
  "purpose": "Provides an API interface for retrieving the last completed block for a user within a learning context, preventing external dependency on the internal BlockCompletion model.",
  "sources": "User and context_key parameters passed to get_key_to_last_completed_block function, and the BlockCompletion.get_latest_block_completed method.",
  "sinks": "Return of last_completed_block.full_block_key, or raising UnavailableCompletionData exception.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (user, context_key) flow into get_latest_block_completed method, whose result influences the return or exception; no external data flows out besides these outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data leakage points detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it calls a method to retrieve the latest completed block, then returns a property of that object or raises an exception if none found. The only external interaction is through the method BlockCompletion.get_latest_block_completed, which presumably handles data retrieval. No suspicious behaviors such as network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious logic are present. The code functions as an API interface with proper exception handling, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple API wrapper around data retrieval from the BlockCompletion model. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a benign, straightforward module intended for internal use.",
