{
  "purpose": "Provides a public API for retrieving the last completed block for a user within a specific learning context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: user, context_key",
  "sinks": "BlockCompletion.get_latest_block_completed method, which internally may access data stores",
  "flows": "Input parameters (user, context_key) -> get_latest_block_completed -> returns BlockCompletion object or raises exception",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard exception handling; straightforward API design.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to fetch the last completed block for a user in a course-like context, raising exceptions if data is unavailable. It relies on an external model method 'get_latest_block_completed'. No data sanitization, external network access, or handling of untrusted input is visible. The code appears to be standard API logic with proper exception handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard API wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks. It mainly delegates to a model method and handles exceptions accordingly.",
