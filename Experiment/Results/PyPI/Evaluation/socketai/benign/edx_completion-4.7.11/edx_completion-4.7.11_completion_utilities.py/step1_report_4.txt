{
  "purpose": "Provides a public API interface for retrieving the last completed block in a learning context, encapsulating interaction with the BlockCompletion model.",
  "sources": "The function get_key_to_last_completed_block reads data via BlockCompletion.get_latest_block_completed(user, context_key).",
  "sinks": "The code returns data (full_block_key) from the BlockCompletion object; no data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input from parameters 'user' and 'context_key' flows into get_latest_block_completed, and the resulting object is used to return full_block_key or raise an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual logic; the code appears to be straightforward API access. The exception handling uses a custom exception, but without any apparent malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple interface layer for retrieving the last completed block for a user in a given context. It calls a method from an imported model, then returns an attribute if available or raises a custom exception. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data leaks. The code does not perform any network communication, system modifications, or contain hidden backdoors. It appears to be a standard, benign API wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign API layer for accessing user progress data. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. No anomalies are detected, and the code's purpose aligns with typical API design.",
