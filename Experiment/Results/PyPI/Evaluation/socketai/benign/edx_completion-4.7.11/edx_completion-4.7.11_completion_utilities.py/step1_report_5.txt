{
  "purpose": "Provide an API interface for retrieving the last completed block for a user in a learning context, preventing external dependencies on the BlockCompletion model.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters 'user' and 'context_key', and from the method 'BlockCompletion.get_latest_block_completed'.",
  "sinks": "Returns 'last_completed_block.full_block_key' if found, or raises an exception; no data is written or sent externally within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('user', 'context_key') -> call to 'BlockCompletion.get_latest_block_completed' -> return of 'full_block_key' or exception raised.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. The code appears straightforward and adheres to typical API design.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that retrieves data using a method from a model class, handling exceptions if data is unavailable. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, data leaks, or backdoors are present. The method and exception handling are standard. No external network connections, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code is a simple interface layer without any embedded malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API wrapper with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external model methods for data retrieval and properly raises exceptions when data is unavailable. There are no indicators of malware or malicious behavior.",
