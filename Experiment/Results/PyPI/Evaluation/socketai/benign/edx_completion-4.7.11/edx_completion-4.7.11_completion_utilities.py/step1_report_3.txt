  "purpose": "Provide a public API for retrieving the last completed block in a learning context, abstracting the underlying BlockCompletion model.",
  "sources": "Calls to BlockCompletion.get_latest_block_completed(user, context_key)",
  "sinks": "Return statement returning last_completed_block.full_block_key, exception raising UnavailableCompletionData",
  "flows": "Input (user, context_key) -> get_latest_block_completed -> output (full_block_key) or exception",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no dynamic code execution, no unusual variables or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple API function that retrieves the latest completed block for a user in a specified context. It calls a method from an imported model, then returns a property or raises an exception. No data is processed from untrusted sources beyond parameters, and no data is transmitted externally. The function relies on the imported model's behavior and exception handling. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears straightforward and standard for a Django-like model API.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as a simple interface to retrieve user progress data from a model. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
