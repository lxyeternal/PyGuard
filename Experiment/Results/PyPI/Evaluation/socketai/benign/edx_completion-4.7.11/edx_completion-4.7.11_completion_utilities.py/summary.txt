  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API wrapper with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. Minor variations in security risk scores (e.g., 0.1) are acceptable but could be lowered to 0. given the benign analysis."
