  "flows": "N/A — no data flow involving untrusted inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard class and exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a simple custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with a constructor that formats an error message including a context key. There are no input/output operations, external data dependencies, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard, harmless custom exception class used for error handling within a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
