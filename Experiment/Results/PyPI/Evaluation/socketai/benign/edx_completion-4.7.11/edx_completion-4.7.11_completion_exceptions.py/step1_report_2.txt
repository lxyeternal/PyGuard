  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for handling completion data errors in a learning system",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; the code defines an exception class",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted data or external input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and standard for custom exception definitions",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class UnavailableCompletionData inheriting from Exception, with an initializer that formats an error message including a context key. There are no indications of code injection, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior. The code's structure and content are typical for exception handling in Python and do not include obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception class used for error handling within a larger system. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
