{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling unavailable completion data within a learning context.",
  "sources": "The constructor parameter 'context_key' used in the exception message.",
  "sinks": "The exception message may be logged or displayed, but contains only the 'context_key', which is controlled within the system.",
  "flows": "The 'context_key' flows from the constructor parameter into the exception message; no external data flows or untrusted inputs are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class with a constructor that formats an error message using a provided 'context_key'. It involves no external data sources, network activity, or data flows involving untrusted inputs. The code is clear, standard, and contains no obfuscation or malicious logic. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's purpose is to signal missing completion data, and it does so safely without introducing vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
