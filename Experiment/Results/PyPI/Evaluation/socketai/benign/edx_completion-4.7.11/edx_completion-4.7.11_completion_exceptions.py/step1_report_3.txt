{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling unavailable completion data in a learning system.",
  "sources": "The class constructor receives 'context_key' as input.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs an error message string using 'context_key', but does not write to files, send data over the network, or handle untrusted external input beyond this.",
  "flows": "Input 'context_key' flows into the exception message, which is then used for raising an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception inheriting from Exception. The constructor formats an error message incorporating 'context_key'. There are no external data sources, network activity, or suspicious code constructs. The code performs a typical pattern for custom exceptions without any unusual behavior or hidden intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
