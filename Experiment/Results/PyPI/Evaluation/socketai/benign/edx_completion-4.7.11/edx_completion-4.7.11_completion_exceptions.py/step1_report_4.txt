  "purpose": "Define a custom exception for handling unavailable completion data in a learning system.",
  "sources": "Input: None (no external data input or environment variables used).",
  "sinks": "Output: Raising an exception with a message that includes the 'context_key'.",
  "flows": "When an error occurs, the exception is instantiated with 'context_key' and raised.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, defining a standard exception class with a message.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class 'UnavailableCompletionData' inheriting from 'Exception'. It initializes with a 'context_key' parameter, which is used in the error message. There are no suspicious code patterns, external dependencies, or obfuscated constructs. The class appears to serve as a specific error indicator within a learning or completion system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
