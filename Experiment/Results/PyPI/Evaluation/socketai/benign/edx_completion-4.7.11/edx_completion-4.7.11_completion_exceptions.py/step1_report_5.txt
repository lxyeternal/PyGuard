{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling unavailable completion data in a learning system.",
  "sources": "The code reads the parameter 'context_key' during exception initialization.",
  "sinks": "The exception message may be used for logging or display, but no untrusted data handling or external output is evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'context_key' is passed to the exception constructor, which formats it into an error message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and well-structured. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with an __init__ method that formats an error message using the provided 'context_key'. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The class is used for signaling specific failure states within a system, with no external calls or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom exception for handling specific error conditions. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks present.",
