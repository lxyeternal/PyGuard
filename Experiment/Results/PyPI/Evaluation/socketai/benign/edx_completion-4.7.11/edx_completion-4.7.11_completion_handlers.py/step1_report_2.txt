{
  "purpose": "The code handles signal events related to course content completion updates in an edX platform, specifically updating user progress when problems are scored.",
  "sources": "Reads data from event arguments (kwargs), including 'usage_id', 'course_id', 'user_id', 'score_deleted', and 'grader_response'.",
  "sinks": "Uses the data to load classes, parse keys, and submit completion objects to the database; potentially writes user progress data.",
  "flows": "Input data ('usage_id', 'course_id', 'user_id') -> parse and validate keys -> determine block type -> check completion mode -> record completion status -> save to database.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Uses standard Django ORM and logging. No suspicious network activity or file operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code listens to a signal (probably for scoring events). It retrieves and validates the block's usage key and course context, handling potential errors gracefully. It filters blocks based on completion mode and custom completion settings. Depending on scoring deletion, it submits a completion status. The process involves standard ORM operations and key parsing, with no suspicious code paths or data exfiltration points. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of an edX course platform, handling user progress updates securely. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks based on this code snippet.",
