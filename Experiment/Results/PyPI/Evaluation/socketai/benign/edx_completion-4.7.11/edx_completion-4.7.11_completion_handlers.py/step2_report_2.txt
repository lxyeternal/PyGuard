  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Reported Issues in the Code:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a signal handler that updates course block completion status based on scoring events, which aligns with the code's purpose.\n- The code parses 'usage_id' and 'course_id' from kwargs, loads class types, retrieves user info, and updates completion status—consistent with the reports.\n- No discrepancies or missing elements are observed; the code functions as described.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code handles exceptions during key parsing (`InvalidKeyError`) and skips blocks with custom completion or unsupported modes.\n- They note the absence of suspicious or malicious code, external network activity, or obfuscation.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the reports.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: approximately 0.1–0.2\n- These seem reasonable given the code's nature—standard event handling, no malicious payloads, no obfuscation.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n\n- The highest security risk score is 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- No evidence of vulnerabilities like injection, insecure data handling, or malicious code.\n- The code interacts with database models and external classes but does so securely and predictably.\n\n**5. Malware Score Analysis:**\n\n- All reports correctly assign malware = 0.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity—no network calls, no code injection, no backdoors.\n\n**6. Challenging Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n\n- The reports do not assume malicious intent; they focus on the code's functionality.\n- They acknowledge standard validation and error handling.\n- No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities are made.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2 (reflecting minimal security risk due to potential misconfiguration or edge cases, but no real threat)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a legitimate, straightforward event handler for updating course completion status within an LMS platform. It employs standard validation, exception handling, and database interactions, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Aspect          | Score |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Malware         | 0      |\n| Obfuscated      | 0      |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2    |\n\n**Final notes:** The code appears safe, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose. No further security concerns are identified.",
