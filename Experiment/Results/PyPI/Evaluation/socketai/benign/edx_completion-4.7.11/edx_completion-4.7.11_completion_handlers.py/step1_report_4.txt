{
  "purpose": "The code handles signal events related to updating course completion status for XBlocks in an edX platform, particularly when a problem is scored.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include kwargs['usage_id'], kwargs['course_id'], kwargs['user_id'], kwargs.get('score_deleted'), and kwargs.get('grader_response').",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include usage of UsageKey.from_string(), LearningContextKey.from_string(), XBlock.load_class(), User.objects.get(), and BlockCompletion.objects.submit_completion().",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (usage_id, course_id, user_id, score_deleted, grader_response) through key parsing and class loading, to user retrieval and finally to submitting completion status.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. The code interacts with database models and class methods but does not exhibit obfuscated or unusual language features. No suspicious code paths or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs validation of input keys, class loading based on block types, and updates user completion data. It uses standard Django ORM calls and external library functions with proper exception handling for invalid keys. The only external data inputs are identifiers and flags, with no evident handling of untrusted input beyond parsing. The logic is consistent with expected behavior for a completion tracking system and does not include any malicious activity, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of an edX platform's completion tracking system, with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It safely handles inputs and updates user progress accordingly.",
