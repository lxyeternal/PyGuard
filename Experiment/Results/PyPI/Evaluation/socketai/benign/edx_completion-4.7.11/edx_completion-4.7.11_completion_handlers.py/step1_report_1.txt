  "sinks": "BlockCompletion.objects.submit_completion() method which updates completion data in the database",
  "flows": "Input from event kwargs ('usage_id', 'course_id', 'user_id', 'score_deleted', 'grader_response') -> validation and parsing -> database update via submit_completion()",
  "anomalies": "Use of exception handling for key parsing, no hardcoded secrets, standard use of Django ORM, no suspicious external network activity or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code functions as an event handler that triggers on scoring events. It parses identifiers from kwargs, handles potential parsing errors, and updates completion status. It uses standard Django and edX platform classes and methods, with no suspicious code or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, no external network calls, and no obfuscated or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate event handler for tracking course progress. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It simply updates completion status based on scoring events within an educational platform.",
