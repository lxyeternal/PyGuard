{
  "purpose": "This module defines configuration settings for feature toggles in the completion app, specifically managing a toggle for completion tracking using WaffleSwitch.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values for namespace and toggle name, and constructs a WaffleSwitch object using these strings.",
  "sinks": "The WaffleSwitch constructor could potentially be a sink if it performs network access or writes to persistent storage, but typically it just sets up a toggle object.",
  "flows": "Static strings define toggle names and namespace; these are used to instantiate WaffleSwitch. No untrusted input is processed or propagated.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, and no dynamic or obfuscated code behavior. The use of WaffleSwitch appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static configuration for feature toggles, with the creation of a WaffleSwitch object for the 'completion' namespace and 'enable_completion_tracking' toggle. No user input, external data, or dynamic execution occurs. The comments indicate maintained backward compatibility, but no suspicious activity or malicious patterns are present. The WaffleSwitch is likely a standard toggle object used for feature management without network or file system side effects during module import.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, well-structured configuration module for feature toggles. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code is straightforward and appears safe.",
