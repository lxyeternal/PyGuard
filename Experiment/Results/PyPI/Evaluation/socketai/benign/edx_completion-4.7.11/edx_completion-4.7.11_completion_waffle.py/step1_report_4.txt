{
  "purpose": "Define configuration settings for the completion app using waffle switches, specifically for enabling or disabling completion tracking.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name (__name__) and static strings for namespace and toggle names. It also imports WaffleSwitch from an external module.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs a string for the waffle switch name using the namespace and toggle name; it does not process untrusted input or perform any data output.",
  "flows": "The static strings are combined with __name__ to create the toggle name, which is passed to WaffleSwitch; no untrusted data flows to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code uses straightforward definitions and imports, with no dynamic or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple configuration module defining a waffle switch for enabling completion tracking. It imports a toggle class, sets static configuration strings, and creates a switch object with a concatenated name. The use of __name__ is standard in Python modules for module identification. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or insecure practices. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup with no malicious intent or security issues. It simply defines a feature toggle using established patterns. No risks are identified.",
