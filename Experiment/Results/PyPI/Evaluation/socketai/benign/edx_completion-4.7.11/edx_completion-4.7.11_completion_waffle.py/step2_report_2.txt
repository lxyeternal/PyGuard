  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - The code defines static configuration for feature toggles using `WaffleSwitch`.\n   - It constructs toggle names from static strings and the module name (`__name__`).\n   - No dynamic code, user input, external data, or network operations are involved.\n   - The code appears to be straightforward and standard for feature flag configuration.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Malicious Behavior**:\n   - None of the reports identify any anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, file I/O, or other side effects during import.\n   - The `WaffleSwitch` class is likely a simple object for feature toggling, not a sink for malicious activity.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or very close to 0.\n   - The overall assessment aligns with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns**:\n   - Since `WaffleSwitch` is instantiated with static strings and no external input, there are no injection or code execution risks.\n   - The only potential \"sink\" is the creation of a toggle object, which in this context is benign.\n\n5. **Summary of Recommendations**:\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk ~0) are appropriate.\n   - No change in scores is necessary.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as safe and standard.\n\n**My own assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 (minimal, as it's configuration code, but not entirely zero because misconfiguration could affect application behavior)\n\n**Final conclusion**:\nThis code is a simple, static configuration module for feature toggles with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The current scores are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:\n- No issues present.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- Scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- The code is safe and standard for feature toggle configuration.",
