{
  "purpose": "This module defines configuration settings for toggle switches related to completion tracking in an application, specifically for enabling or disabling certain features.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'edx_toggles.toggles' module to import WaffleSwitch, and uses constants defined within the module itself for toggle names.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or used in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities. The code only instantiates a configuration object.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing a toggle class, defining a namespace and toggle name, then creating an instance of WaffleSwitch with those values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports a toggle class, defines a namespace and a toggle name for completion tracking, and creates a WaffleSwitch instance for configuration. There are no inputs from external sources, no untrusted data handling, no dynamic code execution, or secret leakage. All operations are static and standard for feature flag configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal configuration module for feature toggles, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or execute untrusted code.",
