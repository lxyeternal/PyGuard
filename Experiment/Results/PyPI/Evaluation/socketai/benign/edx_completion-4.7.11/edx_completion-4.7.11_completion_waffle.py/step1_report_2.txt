{
  "purpose": "Define configuration settings using waffle switches for the completion app, specifically to toggle completion tracking functionality.",
  "sources": "Import from edx_toggles.toggles, variables WAFFLE_NAMESPACE and ENABLE_COMPLETION_TRACKING, and the creation of WaffleSwitch instance.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output functions; configuration variables are static, and WaffleSwitch is a class instantiation with controlled parameters.",
  "flows": "Static configuration variables are used to construct the WaffleSwitch object, with no flow of untrusted data or external input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward configuration with no hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a toggle class, sets namespace and toggle name variables, and creates a switch object with a predictable pattern. It includes descriptive comments and maintains backward compatibility. There are no signs of code injection, malicious behavior, or malicious data handling. The static variables and object instantiation are safe and standard for feature flag management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical configuration setup for feature toggles and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe, with no anomalies or malware indicators.",
