  "purpose": "Defines a feature toggle for completion tracking using WaffleSwitch.",
  "sources": "Static strings for namespace and toggle name, and the instantiation of WaffleSwitch with these strings and __name__.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform side effects.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of WaffleSwitch with static parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward and static, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a toggle class, defines static configuration strings, and creates a toggle object with no dynamic or external data. It does not perform network, file, or runtime operations that could introduce vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the code as static configuration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. Malware scores are appropriately zero; security risk scores are minimal, reflecting the static and benign nature of the code. The use of __name__ in the toggle name is standard and safe. No anomalies or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static feature toggle configuration with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
