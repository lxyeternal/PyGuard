  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward configuration module that imports a toggle class (`WaffleSwitch`), defines static strings for namespace and toggle name, and creates a toggle object.\n- No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution occurs.\n- The code does not perform network access, file I/O, or any other side effects during import.\n- The use of `__name__` in the toggle name is standard and safe.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- All reports conclude the code is safe, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue Presence Confirmation**\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports identify that the code is static, straightforward, and contains no malicious activity. No issues are found.\n\n---\n\n### **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**\n\n- **Are there any logical errors or flaws?**  \n  **No.** All reports correctly interpret the code as a configuration setup for feature toggles, with no security risks.\n\n- **Are any scores unreasonable?**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The security risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which seems appropriate given the static nature.\n\n- **Is the risk score justified?**  \n  The highest security risk score is 0.1, which is minimal and acceptable for static configuration code.\n\n- **Are malware scores justified?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly assign malware score 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Score Justification & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports correctly assign **0**. No malicious code or behavior is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  All reports assign **0**, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  The highest is 0.1, which is reasonable. Given the code's static nature, this is acceptable.\n\n- **Confidence levels:**  \n  All are 1 or 1.0, which is justified given the clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Challenging Assumptions & Claims**\n\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions. All correctly interpret the code as safe configuration logic.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Personal Assessment**\n\nConsidering all points, I concur with the reports' evaluations. The code is a standard feature toggle configuration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** (to reflect minimal inherent risk in static configuration code, but not security concern)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\nThe code is safe, static, and well-structured. No issues or malicious activity are present. The existing scores are appropriate, and I see no need for adjustments.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n**No security concerns.** The code is safe and typical for feature toggle configuration.",
