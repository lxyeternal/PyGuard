{
  "purpose": "The code defines configuration settings for a feature toggle in an application, specifically to enable or disable completion tracking.",
  "sources": "The code reads a toggle setting from the WaffleSwitch class instance and defines constant strings for configuration purposes.",
  "sinks": "The only potential sink is the WaffleSwitch instantiation, which could affect application behavior based on the toggle state.",
  "flows": "The toggle name string is constructed from constants and passed to the WaffleSwitch constructor; no untrusted input flows into critical security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code uses standard configuration patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a toggle class, defines a namespace, and a toggle name for enabling completion tracking. It then creates an instance of WaffleSwitch with these parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. The implementation appears to be straightforward configuration logic without external inputs or outputs that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple configuration module for feature toggles and contains no malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices for feature flag management.",
