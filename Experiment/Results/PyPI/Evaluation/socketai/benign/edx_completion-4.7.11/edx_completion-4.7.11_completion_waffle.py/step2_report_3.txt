  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code is a straightforward configuration module that defines a feature toggle using `WaffleSwitch`.\n   - It imports the toggle class, sets static strings for namespace and toggle name, and creates a toggle object.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, user input processing, network access, or data leakage.\n   - The code appears static, well-structured, and safe.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is safe, with no anomalies or malicious activity.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is static configuration with no suspicious behavior.\n   - No factual errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given & Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0 or very low, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Security risk scores are also low or zero, consistent with the code's nature.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified.\n\n4. **Risk & Malware Justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely static configuration with no external data, network activity, or obfuscation, the risk and malware scores should remain at 0.\n   - No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are justified here; the code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n5. **Potential for Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation:**\n   - The use of `__name__` is standard and not suspicious.\n   - No obfuscation or hidden behavior is present.\n   - The creation of the toggle object is straightforward.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment & Personal Estimate:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 (or very close to zero, given the static nature and lack of external dependencies)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a simple, safe configuration module for feature toggles. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Keep security risk at 0.\n- Confirm that no external dependencies or runtime behaviors introduce vulnerabilities elsewhere in the system.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The reports correctly identify its safety and simplicity.",
