{
  "purpose": "This code manages and tracks user completion of course blocks, including submitting, batch updating, and retrieving completion data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as user objects, block keys, and completion values. It accesses the database for BlockCompletion records and reads environment/configuration via imported modules.",
  "sinks": "The code updates database records and emits tracking logs using the tracker.emit function, which could potentially be misused if the tracking system is compromised or if data is manipulated. No other untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "User input and function parameters flow into methods like submit_completion and submit_batch_completion. These methods validate data and write to the database. Tracking logs are emitted after updates. Data flows from input through validation, database operations, and logging.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard validation and database operations with no evident hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present. Usage of transaction.atomic and get_or_create is standard for concurrency control.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages completion data for course blocks with standard Django ORM patterns. It uses validation, database transactions, and logging appropriately. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden network activity. The only external interaction is with a tracking system, which is typical and expected for analytics. All data handling appears to be within the scope of legitimate course tracking. No suspicious or malicious code is present, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of course completion tracking. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Its functions and data flows are consistent with standard Django application practices for educational platforms.",
