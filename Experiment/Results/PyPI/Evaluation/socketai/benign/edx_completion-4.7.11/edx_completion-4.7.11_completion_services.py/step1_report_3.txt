{
  "purpose": "The code provides a runtime service for managing user completion data in an e-learning system, including retrieving and submitting completion statuses for blocks within a course.",
  "sources": "User data accessed through self._user; environment settings via django.conf.settings; external calls through models like BlockCompletion and configuration switches like waffle.ENABLE_COMPLETION_TRACKING_SWITCH; data inputs from function parameters such as candidates, blocks, user_ids, and node objects.",
  "sinks": "Data submitted to BlockCompletion.objects.submit_completion; user objects fetched from database; completion statuses returned or modified in internal methods; no external network or system command calls.",
  "flows": "Input data (user, block keys, user IDs, nodes) flows into methods like get_completions, submit_group_completion, and submit_completion, then data is processed and stored via model methods. The get_completions method reads from database; submit methods write to database. No external system interaction observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obscure obfuscation present. No malicious backdoors or code injections detected. Usage of environment variables or settings is standard. The code appears straightforward and adheres to typical Django service patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django-based completion management service, handling user progress data without any suspicious logic. It does not contain any network operations, system commands, or data exfiltration routines. It securely interacts with database models and external feature switches. No anomalies or malicious patterns such as hidden backdoors, code injection, or privacy violations are present. The functions are focused on business logic rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of a course completion service with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates within the expected boundaries of a learning platform backend, handling user progress data securely. Therefore, it is assessed as safe with a very low likelihood of malicious intent.",
