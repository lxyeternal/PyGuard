  "purpose": "Provides completion tracking and status management for users within an LMS, interfacing with models, settings, and user data.",
  "sources": "User object, context key, settings, database models (BlockCompletion), feature toggles (waffle).",
  "sinks": "Database queries and updates via ORM, feature switch checks, data returned to calling functions.",
  "flows": "Input from user and block key parameters flows into database queries and completion logic; data flows back as completion statuses and feature toggle states.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a completion service in Django, utilizing ORM for data access, feature toggles for configuration, and standard patterns for handling user progress. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. Data flows are internal, with no external network calls or suspicious logic. The code adheres to best practices, with no signs of sabotage or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, well-structured LMS completion tracking module with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It aligns with the reports' assessments, which correctly assign a malware score of 0 and low risk scores (~0.1-0.2). The overall security posture is very low risk, and the code can be considered safe for supply chain purposes.",
