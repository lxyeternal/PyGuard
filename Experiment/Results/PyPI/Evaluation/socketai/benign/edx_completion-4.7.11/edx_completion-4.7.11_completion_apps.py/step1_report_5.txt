  "purpose": "Define and configure the Django application 'completion' with URL, settings, and signal handlers.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; configuration data is hardcoded within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; no database queries or network calls present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely sets configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated elements. The signal path references are strings pointing to existing Django signals, which are typical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig class with static configuration dictionaries for URL, settings, and signal integration. No input handling, dynamic execution, or network communication is present. All components appear standard for a Django app setup. No unusual patterns or malicious code behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration for a Django application, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It solely manages app setup parameters.",
