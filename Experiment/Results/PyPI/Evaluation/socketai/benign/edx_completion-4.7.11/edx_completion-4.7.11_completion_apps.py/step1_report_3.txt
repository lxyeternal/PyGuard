  "purpose": "Configure a Django application named 'completion' with URL, settings, and signal handlers.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external systems, executes commands, or interacts with untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines static configuration structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward Django app configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig class with static configuration dictionaries for URL routing, settings, and signal handling. No dynamic code execution, no data input/output operations, nor suspicious patterns detected. The only data structures are static dictionaries and class attributes. The signals and URLs are specified as strings, but these are standard configuration patterns. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django app configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply sets up application parameters for a 'completion' app within a Django project.",
