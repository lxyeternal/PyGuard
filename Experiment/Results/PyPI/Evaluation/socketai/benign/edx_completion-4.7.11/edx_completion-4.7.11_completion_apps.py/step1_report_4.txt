  "purpose": "Define app configuration for the 'completion' module within a Django project, including URL, settings, and signal configurations.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static code defining configurations and signal handlers.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Signal receiver and configuration structures are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code solely establishes Django app configuration parameters, including URL routing, settings, and signal handlers. No external input handling, data processing, or network operations are present. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The signal receiver is a typical pattern in Django for decoupled event handling. The code appears straightforward and standard for Django app setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal Django application configuration module with no indications of malicious or suspicious behavior. It simply defines app settings and signal handling configurations.",
