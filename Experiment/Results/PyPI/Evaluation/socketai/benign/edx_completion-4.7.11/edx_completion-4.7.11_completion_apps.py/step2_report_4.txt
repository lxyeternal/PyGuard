  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard Django AppConfig class, with static configuration dictionaries for URL routing, settings, and signal handlers.\n- No dynamic code, external data, network operations, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be straightforward and adheres to typical Django practices.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks is detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a valid Django AppConfig subclass with static configurations. No issues or errors are evident.\n- **Malware potential:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.\n- **Security risk:** Given the static nature and standard patterns, the risk is minimal.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is clear and straightforward.\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely configuration with no dynamic or external data, and no suspicious patterns, the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security issues detected)\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- The logic and reasoning are sound.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n- The code is a standard Django app configuration.\n- No malicious or suspicious elements are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
