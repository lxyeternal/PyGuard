  "purpose": "Configuration setup for the 'completion' Django app, defining URL routing, settings, and signal handlers.",
  "sources": "Static dictionaries for URL patterns, settings, and signal configurations; string references to signals and URL regex patterns.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and adheres to standard Django practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with static configuration dictionaries for URL routing, app settings, and signal handlers. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or environment-dependent logic is present. The regex pattern and signal references are standard and non-malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose is purely configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are justified and consistent with the code's static, benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Django application configuration module with no malicious or security concerns. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
