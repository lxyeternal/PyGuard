{
  "purpose": "Provide terminal output enhancements such as colored text, table printing, and user input prompts.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input via the input() function in text_input().",
  "sinks": "The input() function could be exploited if user input is used insecurely elsewhere, but within this code, it only returns the string.",
  "flows": "User provides input through input() which is returned; no further processing or untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. No network access, data leaks, or malicious commands detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines escape sequences for terminal coloring and styles, and includes functions for printing tables and getting user input. The input() call is standard and only captures user data without further misuse. No indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code is straightforward and lacks suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for terminal display enhancements and user input. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks detected.",
