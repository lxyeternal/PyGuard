{
  "purpose": "Provides terminal styling escape sequences, a table printing utility, and a user input prompt function.",
  "sources": "The input() function for user input.",
  "sinks": "The return of user input data; no external data transmission or processing.",
  "flows": "User provides input via input(), which is returned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and uses standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines ANSI escape sequences for styling terminal output, a function to print tables with formatted columns, and a simple input prompt. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The input() function is used safely, merely capturing user input without further processing. No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and utility-focused. Given the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities, the scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are justified and consistent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It serves as a utility module for terminal styling and user input, with minimal security risk. The assigned scores accurately reflect its safety profile.",
