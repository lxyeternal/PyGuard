  "purpose": "Provide terminal output formatting and input functions for enhanced shell interactions.",
  "sources": "Reading user input via input() function.",
  "sinks": "User input received via input(), no further sinks present.",
  "flows": "User input flows from input() to the returned variable, with no further processing that could lead to malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code primarily consists of escape sequences for styling terminal output and a straightforward input prompt.",
  "analysis": "The code defines escape sequences for various terminal styles within the Codes class, intended for enhancing printed output. The print_table function formats and prints tabular data, and the text_input function prompts for user input. There are no external data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The only data input occurs via the input() function, which is standard and benign in this context. The code does not perform any operations that could lead to data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. Overall, the code appears to be purely for formatting and user interaction without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for terminal styling, table printing, and user input. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to improve terminal output presentation and gather user input without any harmful side effects.",
