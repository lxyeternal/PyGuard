{
  "purpose": "Provide terminal output enhancements and input functionalities, including color codes and table printing.",
  "sources": "Input function (input), no other external data sources.",
  "sinks": "The input() function receives user input; no other sinks that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "User input flows from input() to the calling code, no further processing or external data transmission occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. The code primarily defines constants and simple functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines ANSI escape sequences for colored and styled terminal output, a function to print tables, and a function to receive user input. The escape sequences are standard and harmless. The print_table function formats and outputs tabular data using string formatting; no data leaks or injections are present. The text_input function simply calls Python's built-in input(), which is benign in this context. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or external communication. The code is straightforward and focused on UI formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a harmless utility module for terminal display and input handling. It does not contain malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for user interaction and output styling.",
