{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and constants for enhanced terminal output formatting and user input collection.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input via the input() function in the text_input() function.",
  "sinks": "User input collected via input() which could potentially be used in a malicious context if further processed insecurely, but no direct dangerous sink is present here.",
  "flows": "Input collected in text_input() could potentially be used downstream; however, within this code, no further flows or data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The escape sequences are standard for terminal formatting. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a class with ANSI escape codes for text formatting, which is standard. It includes a print_table() function for displaying data in tabular form, which constructs formatted strings for console output. The text_input() function prompts the user and returns their input. No external data sources, network communication, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses common patterns without any suspicious or harmful constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, providing utility functions for terminal output and user input. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this module.",
