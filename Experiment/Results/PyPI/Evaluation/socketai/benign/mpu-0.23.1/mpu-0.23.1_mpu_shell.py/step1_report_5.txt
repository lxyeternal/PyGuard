  "purpose": "Provide terminal output enhancements, including colored text and table printing, as well as user input prompts.",
  "sources": "Reading user input via the input() function.",
  "sinks": "The input() function receives untrusted user input; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "User input flows from the input() function to the caller; no further data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines escape sequences for colored and styled terminal output, and functions for printing tables and prompting user input. All components are standard utilities for terminal interface enhancement. The input() function is used for user interaction, which is normal. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious network activity, or backdoors. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are present. The code relies solely on standard library functions and no external dependencies are invoked that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, providing terminal styling and user input functions without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
