{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, defining dependencies, package data, and extras for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines static dependencies and package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the script does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the script solely configures package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no obfuscated code, hidden logic, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py configuration, with dependencies and package data. No code injection, malicious behavior, or security flaws are evident. The provided reports are empty, indicating no detected issues or vulnerabilities. External dependencies are common packages with no known malicious use. The code structure is clear and conventional, with no anomalies or obfuscation. Given the lack of evidence, the likelihood of malicious intent or security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The empty reports do not provide any contradicting evidence. All scores should be zero, reflecting a safe and secure package setup.",
