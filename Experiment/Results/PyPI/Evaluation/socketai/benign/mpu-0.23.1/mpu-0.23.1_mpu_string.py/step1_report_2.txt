{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for string manipulation, validation (emails, numbers, IBANs, IP addresses), and data formatting (bytes).",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function parameters, mainly strings, and external files (e.g., 'iban.csv' via pkg_resources).",
  "sinks": "Data is processed within functions; no evident output sinks like network, files, or external systems are directly used for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input strings flow through validation functions, with some data being read from external resource files for IBAN validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are evident. No suspicious network activity or system modifications are present. Use of 'pkg_resources' for external file access is standard but warrants cautious trust in the package integrity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of validation and conversion utilities with no evident malicious behavior. It reads external data for IBAN validation, which is standard for such checks. No network, file writing, or command execution occurs. No obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden malicious logic are detected. The functions perform typical validation tasks, and no data leaks or suspicious data handling are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for string and data validation with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The use of external resource files is standard for IBAN validation, and no harmful activities are detected.",
