{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for string manipulation, validation, and formatting, including email validation, numeric conversions, IBAN validation, IP address validation, and byte size formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters; reads resource file 'iban.csv' for IBAN validation.",
  "sinks": "Uses data from resource files (iban.csv) and processes input parameters; no external network or data exfiltration points identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through validation and processing functions; resource file data used for IBAN validation; no untrusted external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external resource file 'iban.csv' for IBAN validation could potentially be manipulated if the resource is compromised, but this is standard practice for data validation. No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs various string validations, conversions, and formatting. It includes functions for email validation, numeric type checking, IBAN validation using external data, IP address validation, and byte size formatting. The only external dependency is reading a CSV resource for IBAN validation, which appears standard. No code patterns indicating malicious intent, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a collection of utility functions for validation and formatting purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The use of resource files for IBAN validation is standard and not suspicious. Overall, the code is benign and safe for use.",
