{
  "purpose": "The code provides various utility functions for string manipulation, validation, and formatting, including email validation, type conversions, IBAN validation, IP address validation, and byte size formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads data from package resource file 'iban.csv' for IBAN validation using mpu.io.read.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; no network, file writes, or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input from function parameters flows through validation and parsing logic; no external data flows to external systems or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Use of standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple validation and conversion functions with clear, standard implementations. The IBAN validation references external CSV data but only reads it locally; no network activity or data exfiltration occurs. No dynamic code execution, eval, or obfuscation present. All functions handle typical validation tasks without malicious intent or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a collection of utility functions for string validation and formatting, implemented securely with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. No malicious code, data leaks, or sabotage mechanisms are evident.",
