{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for string manipulation, validation, and formatting, including email validation, data type checks, IBAN validation, IP address validation, and byte size formatting.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as potential_email_address, potential_int, potential_float, string_, potential_ipv4, iban, nb_bytes.",
  "sinks": "Return statements and internal function calls; no direct sinks that output untrusted data externally or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and processed within functions; no flow leads to external system commands, network communication, or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of package resources and file reading is for data validation (e.g., IBAN). No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for validation and formatting, including email parsing, numeric checks, boolean and None conversions, IBAN validation, IPv4 validation, and byte size formatting. The IBAN validation reads a resource file, which is normal for such validation. No input handling involves external system calls or data transmission. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. Functions perform standard validation tasks with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It performs standard validation and formatting operations without external harm or covert actions.",
