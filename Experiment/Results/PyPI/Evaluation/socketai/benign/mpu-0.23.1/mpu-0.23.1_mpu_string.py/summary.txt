  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility library for string validation and formatting. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms. The use of external resource files for IBAN validation is standard practice. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external data dependencies, which are typical for such validation functions. Therefore, the malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and the overall security risk score at approximately 0.1. The code is safe for supply chain inclusion and poses no security concerns."
