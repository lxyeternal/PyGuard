{
  "purpose": "Provides geometric classes and functions for points, line segments, and their intersections in 2D space.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (Point, LineSegment), functions like do_lines_intersect, internal calculations.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network, or file I/O; purely computational geometry.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to functions; geometric calculations to return points, line segments, or booleans.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard geometric algorithms for points, line segments, intersection detection, and bounding boxes. No external data sources or network activity are involved. The functions perform straightforward calculations, and the import of 'mpu.datastructures.Interval' is used for interval arithmetic in line intersection logic. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code is well-structured, transparent, and adheres to typical geometric computation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent geometric utility library with no malicious intent or security issues. All signals indicate a safe implementation with no obfuscation or malware. The low security risk score (0.0–0.1) is appropriate given its computational nature.",
