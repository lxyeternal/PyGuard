  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of malicious behavior, the appropriateness of the scores, and consistency across all reports.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward geometric utility library.\n- No report indicates any suspicious or malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, code obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- The code relies solely on standard mathematical computations, with no external data sources or untrusted input handling beyond function parameters.\n- The import of `mpu.datastructures.Interval` is standard for interval arithmetic and does not raise suspicion.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious features.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate, describes geometric functions.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected; straightforward geometric algorithms.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0.0, Security risk 0.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard geometric code.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; no network or data exfiltration.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware, safe for use.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.1 (low, possibly default).\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with previous, standard geometry.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; purely computational geometry.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe for use.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as previous.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious features; standard geometric calculations.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Very low (0.0–0.1), consistent with the absence of external threats or malicious features.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\nBased on the detailed review, **the scores are appropriate and consistent** with the code's content and purpose. The reports correctly identify the code as a standard, safe geometric utility library with no malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** **0.0–0.1** — minimal, mainly due to the potential misuse of geometric functions if fed malicious data, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.** The code appears safe, with no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
