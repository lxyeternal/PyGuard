  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes geometric classes/functions, no external data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks, data flows within geometric computations.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns, straightforward geometry code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard geometric algorithms, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purpose-driven, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.0 — aligns with the absence of malicious code.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.0 — code is clear.  \n- Security Risk: 0.0 — no vulnerabilities detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar geometric functions, input via constructor parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks, no network/file I/O.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Uses standard algorithms, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate geometric code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.0 — consistent with analysis.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 — minimal, possibly a default low risk assigned due to computational geometry.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar to previous, with detailed analysis confirming no malicious behavior.\n- Emphasizes standard geometric algorithms, no external data or network activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.0 — no signs of malware.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is transparent.  \n- Security Risk: 0.1 — consistent with previous, very low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same conclusion: standard geometric utility, no malicious activity.\n- No external data sources or sinks, no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.0 — aligns with findings.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — no risks identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar findings: standard geometry code, no external I/O, no suspicious patterns.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.0 — consistent.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n- Security Risk: 0 — no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0.0, and the code is straightforward geometric calculations with no external data or network activity. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious code.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is clean, well-structured, and transparent.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All are at or near 0, with a slight 0.1 possibly due to the computational nature of the code, but no actual vulnerabilities or attack vectors are present.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — no malicious intent detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — code is clear and understandable.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.0** — no vulnerabilities or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and the code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n**Note:** Always consider context and integration, but based solely on this code snippet and reports, it is safe.",
