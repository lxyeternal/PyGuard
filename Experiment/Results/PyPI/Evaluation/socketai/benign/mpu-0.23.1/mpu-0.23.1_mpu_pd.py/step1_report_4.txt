{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for describing and analyzing pandas DataFrames, including generating statistical summaries and metadata about columns.",
  "sources": "Imports pandas, datetime, logging, and pkg_resources; reads 'countries.csv' from package data using pkg_resources.resource_filename.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; no network operations, file writes, or external command executions are present.",
  "flows": "Reads the CSV file into a DataFrame; functions analyze DataFrame contents and generate reports; no flow from external untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Uses pkg_resources to load internal resource files, which is standard; no suspicious or malicious code patterns detected. Logging warnings are benign and related to data inspection.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on data analysis with pandas and does not perform any external communication, file modification, or system commands. It loads internal CSV data, performs type inference, and prints statistical summaries. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are found. No obfuscated or suspicious language features are used. The code's structure is typical for data analysis utilities. The only noteworthy aspect is the warning about columns with few unique values, which is standard advice. No malicious or sabotage intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard pandas utility module with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks. It strictly performs data analysis tasks without external side effects.",
