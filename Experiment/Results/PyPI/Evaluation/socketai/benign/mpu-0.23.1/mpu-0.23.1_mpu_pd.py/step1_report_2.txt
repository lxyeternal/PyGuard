  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for describing and analyzing pandas DataFrames, including data summarization and type inference.",
  "sources": "Reading 'countries.csv' resource file via pkg_resources.resource_filename; import statements; potentially user-provided DataFrame inputs.",
  "sinks": "Logging warnings; printing tables; no data leaks or external data transmission detected.",
  "flows": "User supplies DataFrame to 'describe' and its internal functions; data is read from CSV file at startup; no external network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; use of 'pkg_resources.resource_filename' to load a CSV file is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious data handling. Warning logs for categorical column suspicion are benign and for informational purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a CSV file from package resources, performs data type inference, and prints descriptive statistics. It contains no external network communications, code injection, or suspicious behavior. The use of logging and pandas operations are standard. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage were identified. The code is primarily utility functions for data analysis with no malicious patterns or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard pandas utility module with no malicious behavior or security risks. It loads a resource file, processes DataFrame metadata, and outputs descriptive tables. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
