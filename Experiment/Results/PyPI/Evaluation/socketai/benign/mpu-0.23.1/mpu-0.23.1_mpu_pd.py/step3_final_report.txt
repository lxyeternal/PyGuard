{
  "purpose": "The code provides pandas utility functions for data analysis, including creating example data, describing DataFrames, and classifying columns by data type. It loads a CSV resource file ('countries.csv') via pkg_resources and outputs summaries and warnings.",
  "sources": "Reads internal resource file 'countries.csv' using pkg_resources.resource_filename; processes DataFrame columns for analysis.",
  "sinks": "Prints tables and warnings via mpu.shell.print_table and logger.warning; no external network, file writes, or command executions.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded locally from resource files; functions analyze DataFrame data and output summaries without external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Usage of mpu.shell.print_table is assumed benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard pandas data analysis tasks, loading internal resources and printing summaries. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. Warnings about columns with few unique values are benign. The code's behavior is consistent with a utility module, and no external communication or code execution occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pandas utility module for data analysis with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate, though the securityRisk could be lowered to 0.0 given the benign nature.",
