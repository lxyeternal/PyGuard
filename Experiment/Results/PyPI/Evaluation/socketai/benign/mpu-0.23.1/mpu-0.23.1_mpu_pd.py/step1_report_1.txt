{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for analyzing and describing pandas DataFrames, including creating example data, classifying columns by data type, and summarizing column statistics.",
  "sources": "The code reads a CSV file containing country data using pkg_resources.resource_filename, and reads DataFrame data from pandas operations within functions.",
  "sinks": "No unsafe data sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or command execution are present. Logging is used, but not for malicious purposes.",
  "flows": "The code loads CSV data, processes DataFrame columns to gather statistics, and outputs descriptive tables via mpu.shell.print_table.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. Usage of third-party libraries is typical for data analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily focused on data analysis and description. It imports and reads data from a resource file, processes DataFrame columns to categorize data types, and prints statistical summaries. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, code injection, or backdoors. Logging is used for warnings about data characteristics, which is standard. The functions operate on pandas DataFrames without executing external or unsafe commands. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are identified. The overall purpose is benign and typical for data exploration tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for pandas DataFrame analysis with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It only reads data locally, processes it, and outputs summaries. No suspicious behavior or malicious activities are detected.",
