  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to the __version__ variable with a comment noting the need to keep it in sync with setup.py. There are no external input sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns or malicious constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version assignment used for package management. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior.",
