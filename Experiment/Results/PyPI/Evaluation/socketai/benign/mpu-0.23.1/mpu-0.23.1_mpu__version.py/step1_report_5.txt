  "sinks": "The __version__ variable itself; no sinks that handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The version string is assigned to __version__, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; only a straightforward version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packaging. No external input, no data processing, no suspicious behavior. The comment indicates maintenance intention to synchronize version info with setup.py, which is standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version assignment for package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
