{
  "purpose": "Assigns the version number for setup.py and the module itself, serving as a static metadata declaration.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it is a hardcoded string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment with no dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward version string declaration with a comment for synchronization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a version string to __version__, with a comment indicating synchronization with setup.py. It contains no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate. There are no vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The code is a standard practice in Python packaging, and the assessment aligns with its simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. The existing reports and scores are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
