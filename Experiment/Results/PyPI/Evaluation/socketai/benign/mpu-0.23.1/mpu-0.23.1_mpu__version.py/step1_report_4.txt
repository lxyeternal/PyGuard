  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input handling; no data leaks or security-critical operations",
  "flows": "None; static assignment without data flow from external sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version string assignment",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to the __version__ variable. There are no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. This is a common practice in Python packages to track versioning. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to store version information with no malicious intent or security issues.",
