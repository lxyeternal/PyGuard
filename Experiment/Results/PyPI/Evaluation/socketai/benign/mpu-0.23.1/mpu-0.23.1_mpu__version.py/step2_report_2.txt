  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple static assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, input handling, or data flow from untrusted sources.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for Python package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that this is standard practice and pose no security risks.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware=0`, `securityRisk=0`, `obfuscated=0`, and `confidence=1`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree on zero risk and no malicious activity, there is no justification for higher scores.\n   - The code is a benign version declaration, common in package management.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as standard version assignment.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, static version assignment used in Python packaging. It is benign, with no security implications or malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nNo changes needed. The current scoring and analysis accurately reflect the code's nature.",
