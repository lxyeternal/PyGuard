  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs are processed or stored.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment from a string to a variable; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and follows common versioning practices.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string representing the package version to the __version__ variable. It includes a comment indicating the version should be kept in sync with setup.py, which is standard practice. No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is minimal, well-structured, and intended for version tracking.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and typical for Python package modules.",
