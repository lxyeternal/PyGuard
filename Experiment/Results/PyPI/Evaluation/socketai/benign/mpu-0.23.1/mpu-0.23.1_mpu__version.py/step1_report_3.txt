  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple version assignment",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to the __version__ variable, which is standard practice for package versioning. There are no signs of input handling, data manipulation, or other suspicious behavior. The code is minimal and appears to be a typical version declaration without any obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version assignment for package identification. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and is safe.",
