  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign set of mathematical functions, including prime generation, factorization, primality testing, etc. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The functions are standard, well-documented, and based on known algorithms.  \n- No external data, network activity, or suspicious code is present.  \n- The prime generator is a known recipe, and no obfuscation is evident.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- The score of 0 for malware and obfuscated is justified.  \n- Security risk is appropriately low.  \n- Confidence is high given the straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the standard, benign algorithms. No malicious code, no external data handling, no obfuscation. Slightly higher securityRisk (0.2), possibly due to resource considerations or minor uncertainties.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code remains standard and safe.  \n- The minor securityRisk could be justified if considering resource consumption or potential misuse, but no actual vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- The malware score remains correctly at 0.  \n- Obfuscated remains at 0.  \n- SecurityRisk=0.2 is acceptable, reflecting minimal concern but no actual risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, with a very high confidence (0.98). No external data, network activity, or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The low securityRisk (0.1) aligns with the benign nature.  \n- No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard, safe mathematical functions with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Fully consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, standard mathematical utilities, no external data, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Fully justified.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n\n- All reports consistently identify the code as benign, with no obfuscation or malware.\n- The malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are zero, matching the straightforward, readable code.\n- Security risk scores are very low, reflecting the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Justification & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear and well-documented.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's nature, a score of 0 or very close to 0 is correct. Slightly higher values (like 0.1 or 0.2) in some reports are acceptable but perhaps slightly overcautious.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a standard mathematical utility library, with known algorithms and no external dependencies or network activity.  \n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. The scores reflect the benign nature of the code. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final note:** Always remain vigilant for future modifications, but based on this static review, the code is safe.",
