  "purpose": "A collection of mathematical utility functions including prime generation, factorization, primality testing, product calculation, argmax, rounding, and gcd, intended for mathematical computations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions such as 'number' in factorize and is_prime, 'iterable' in product and argmax, 'x' and 'decimal_places' in round_up and round_down.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects; functions operate solely on input parameters without external data handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through computations within each function; no external data or network interactions are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, well-documented, and uses standard algorithms without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard mathematical functions with known algorithms. Prime generation uses a classic, benign method. No external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The functions do not perform any malicious operations or system modifications. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward, well-understood implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-documented set of mathematical utilities with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
