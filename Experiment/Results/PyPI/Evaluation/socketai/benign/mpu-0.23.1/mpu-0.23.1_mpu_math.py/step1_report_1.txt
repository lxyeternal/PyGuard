{
  "purpose": "Provide mathematical functions such as prime generation, factorization, primality testing, product calculation, argmax, rounding, and gcd.",
  "sources": "Input data is received through function parameters; no external input or data reading beyond parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to external systems or untrusted sources identified; functions return data locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited within functions, from inputs to processed outputs; no external or network flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The prime generation algorithm is a known, benign implementation. The functions perform straightforward mathematical operations without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of mathematical utility functions, including prime number generation, factorization, primality check, product calculation, argmax, rounding up/down, and gcd calculation. The prime generation uses a known sieve algorithm, and other functions employ standard math techniques. No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are found. The functions are well-documented and appear safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of mathematical functions with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe for use, serving purely computational purposes.",
