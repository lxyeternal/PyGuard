{
  "purpose": "Provide mathematical functions such as prime generation, factorization, primality testing, and utility functions like product, argmax, rounding, and gcd.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data sources dynamically; functions operate on provided parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or transmits data to external sources, networks, or files.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; all functions operate on parameters and return results locally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No backdoors or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of mathematical utility functions with standard algorithms and documented examples. The prime generator uses a well-known sieve method, factorization uses trial division, and other functions perform common operations like product calculation, argmax, and rounding. No external data inputs are processed insecurely, nor are there any network, file, or system calls indicating malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears clean, straightforward, and intended for mathematical computations only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of mathematical utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration. The security risk is minimal, and no malicious intent is evident.",
