  "purpose": "Mathematical functions for prime number generation, factorization, prime checking, product calculation, argument maximization, rounding, and gcd calculation.",
  "sources": "Function inputs such as 'number' in 'factorize' and 'is_prime', 'iterable' in 'product', and 'x' and 'decimal_places' in rounding functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential outputs include prime factors, boolean results, product value, index of maximum value, and rounded floats; no direct data leaks or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through computations, such as 'number' being factorized or checked for primality, 'iterable' being processed for maximum index or product, and rounding functions modifying float values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected. The code appears to perform standard mathematical operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms identified. All algorithms are well-known and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script contains multiple mathematical functions: prime number generator using a classic sieve-like algorithm, prime factorization, primality check, product calculation, argmax, rounding up and down, and gcd calculation. The prime generator is based on a known recipe with no obfuscated or malicious logic. Factorization and primality tests are standard. Rounding functions use common mathematical techniques. GCD implementation employs the Euclidean algorithm. There are no network calls, system modifications, or external data handling. No indicators of malicious intent, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side-effects. Overall, the code appears to be a standard utility library for mathematical operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a collection of mathematical utility functions with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard calculations and prime number handling without any covert or harmful code. No malware indicators or supply chain attack vectors are present.",
