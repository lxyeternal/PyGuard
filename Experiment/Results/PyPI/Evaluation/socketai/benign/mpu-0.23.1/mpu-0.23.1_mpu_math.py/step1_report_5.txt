{
  "purpose": "This module provides various mathematical functions, including prime number generation, factorization, primality testing, and utility functions like product, argmax, rounding, and gcd calculation.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all data is provided as function parameters or internal constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; functions perform computations on provided parameters only.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; computations are based solely on function arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The prime generation uses a well-known algorithm, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard mathematical functions with clear, well-documented implementations. The prime generator is a known algorithm (Eppstein's) with no malicious modifications. The factorize, is_prime, product, argmax, rounding, and gcd functions are straightforward and utilize standard algorithms or Python features. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not include any code injection, data leakage, or unauthorized system access mechanisms. The only potential concern could be resource-intensive functions like generate_primes, but these are benign from a security standpoint.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate collection of mathematical utilities with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It is safe for use and does not contain malware or security risks.",
