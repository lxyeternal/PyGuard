{
  "purpose": "Provide various mathematical functions such as prime generation, factorization, primality testing, and basic arithmetic utilities.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily from function parameters; no external data sources or user inputs are directly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain external data transmission, network communication, or sensitive data leaks; no sinks are present that lead to security concerns.",
  "flows": "The functions operate independently with no data flow leading to external systems or untrusted outputs; internal computations are self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of external libraries (math, operator, functools) is standard and safe. No dynamic code execution or misleading variable usage detected.",
  "analysis": "The code offers standard mathematical utilities with clear, documented algorithms. generate_primes() implements an established prime generator based on a known recipe. factorize() and is_prime() rely on straightforward algorithms without external dependencies or data handling. The functions are self-contained, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be a benign utility module intended for mathematical computations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard mathematical utility library with no malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on provided input parameters and does not perform any insecure operations or data leaks. No indicators of malware or malicious behavior detected.",
