  "purpose": "Utility functions for geospatial calculations, list shuffling, threading, and exception logging.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (e.g., latitude, longitude, numbers, lists), exception traceback in exception_logging.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network activity, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through calculations or operations; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random.shuffle without explicit seed control; standard utility code with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions and classes, including geospatial calculations, list shuffling, threading, and exception logging. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The use of random.shuffle is typical, though external seed control could influence randomness, but this is not malicious. The exception logging captures traceback info without leaking sensitive data. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and free from obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It performs common utility functions without security risks. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
