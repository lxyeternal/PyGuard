  "purpose": "Utility functions for geographic calculations, threading, shuffling, and general helpers in Python.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, third-party modules, and internal modules. Data read from function parameters, environment variables (if any), and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe string formatting in get_google_maps_link and exception_logging; no other apparent sinks for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters (e.g., location coordinates, lists) through calculations and formatting functions, with no external network or untrusted data sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials present. Use of dynamic imports and third-party modules appears standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns detected. Exception logging constructs an object but only logs exceptions, no data exfiltration or command execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions such as threading, clipping, shuffling, geographic calculations, and exception handling. It uses standard libraries and well-known third-party modules without unusual patterns. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The only minor concern is the use of string formatting in URL construction and exception logging, which is standard practice but should be cautious if combined with untrusted input. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of utility functions with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard operations and includes no suspicious or malicious code. The overall security risk is low.",
