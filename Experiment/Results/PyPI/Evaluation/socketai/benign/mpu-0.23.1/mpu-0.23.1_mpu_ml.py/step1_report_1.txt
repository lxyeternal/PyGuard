{
  "purpose": "Provide functions for converting between index lists and one-hot encoded vectors for machine learning applications.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'argmax' from the 'mpu.math' module, which is a third-party library function.",
  "sinks": "The code processes input data for encoding but does not handle untrusted data sources or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (indices or one-hot vectors) is processed locally through functions without external data flow or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for encoding conversions, with input validation. It relies on an external 'argmax' function. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is typical for ML data preprocessing. No potential malicious intent or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, non-malicious, and poses no security threat. It functions solely for data encoding transformations within ML workflows.",
