  "purpose": "Provide functions to convert between index lists and one-hot encoded vectors for machine learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'indices' in indices2one_hot, 'one_hots' in one_hot2indices.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include sinks that handle untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input data (indices or one-hot lists) flows through functions to produce transformed output; no external or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions for data transformation in machine learning: indices2one_hot converts index lists to one-hot vectors; one_hot2indices converts one-hot vectors back to indices. Both functions perform basic, well-understood operations with no external data fetching or network activity. No unusual code patterns, no obfuscated or dynamic code, and no suspicious behavior are present. The 'argmax' function imported is from a local module, presumably standard. The code is clean, purpose-specific, and does not contain any malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data encoding functions for ML purposes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not perform any harmful operations.",
