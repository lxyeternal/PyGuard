{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for converting between index lists and one-hot encoded vectors in machine learning preprocessing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'indices' and 'one_hots' lists, and the external function 'argmax' from 'mpu.math'.",
  "sinks": "The functions process data internally; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the functions, which process and output transformed data; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Minor documentation inconsistency: 'dtype' parameter mentioned in docstring but not used in code; no security anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard ML encoding functions with straightforward logic, proper input validation, and no suspicious patterns. It relies on a common utility 'argmax' from a reputable library. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior are detected. The external dependency is standard and not suspicious. The code is well-documented and clear. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for ML data encoding with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
