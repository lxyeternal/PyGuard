{
  "purpose": "This code is a Sphinx configuration script for building documentation, setting up extensions, paths, and import fallbacks.",
  "sources": "Import statements for importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata, configuration variables, and mock import lists for wx modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or network activity; static configuration data.",
  "flows": "Configuration variables are set without dynamic or untrusted data flow; no network or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad 'except:' clause, extensive mocking of wx modules for documentation purposes, which could be misused but is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Sphinx documentation setup with fallback imports and extensive mocking to avoid dependency issues. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The broad exception handling is common in configuration scripts. The extensive wx mocking is standard for documentation builds and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The high risk score in some reports should be lowered to reflect the benign nature, but overall, the assessments are accurate.",
