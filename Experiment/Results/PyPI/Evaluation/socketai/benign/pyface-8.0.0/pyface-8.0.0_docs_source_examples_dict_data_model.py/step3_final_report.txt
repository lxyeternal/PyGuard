  "purpose": "Provides a GUI data model for displaying and editing dictionary data using traits and pyface libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads data from self.data dictionary; uses traits observers for internal state updates.",
  "sinks": "Updates to self.data via set_value; internal flags for GUI updates; no external data transmission.",
  "flows": "User modifies data through GUI -> set_value updates self.data -> observers trigger internal state changes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a GUI data model with standard patterns. It manages a dictionary, allowing viewing and editing via a GUI, with reactive updates. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external dependencies beyond standard libraries. Observers only update internal flags; no external communication or data exfiltration. The main block creates a simple GUI with sample data, with no network or file operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard GUI data model for dictionary data, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
