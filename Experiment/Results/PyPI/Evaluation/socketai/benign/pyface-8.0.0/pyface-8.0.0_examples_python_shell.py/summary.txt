  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard example of embedding a Python shell within a GUI application. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security breaches. The primary concern is the inherent risk of executing untrusted user input in the embedded shell, which is typical for such features. Overall, the code is safe with low security risk, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent."
