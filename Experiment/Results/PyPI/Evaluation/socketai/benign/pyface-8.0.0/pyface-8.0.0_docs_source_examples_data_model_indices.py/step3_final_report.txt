{
  "purpose": "A data model that displays index information within a GUI application, primarily for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external or untrusted input; it uses internal data structures and library calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks exist that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects; the code only creates GUI components and prints selection events.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the data model to the GUI display; selection events are observed and printed, but this is benign.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; the print callback is standard for debugging or feedback.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data model for displaying index data, constructs a GUI window with a data view widget, and observes selection events with a print callback. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or modify system state. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses common libraries without obfuscation or malicious constructs. The print statement in the observer is benign and typical for debugging. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign GUI application for displaying index data, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
