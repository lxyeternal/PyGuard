  "purpose": "The code defines and manages menu structures for a GUI application, including actions such as opening, closing, exporting, printing, and exiting.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string data for action names; no external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "The code executes print statements within functions tied to menu actions; no untrusted data or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The menu actions are associated with functions that simply print messages; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, defining GUI menus and handlers.",
  "analysis": "The code imports GUI menu management classes and creates menu structures with predefined actions and separators. It defines functions that only print messages and ties them to menu actions. No external data sources, network interactions, or security-sensitive operations are involved. The code appears to be a standard GUI menu setup without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup of GUI menu actions with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security threats. It performs standard menu management tasks with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
