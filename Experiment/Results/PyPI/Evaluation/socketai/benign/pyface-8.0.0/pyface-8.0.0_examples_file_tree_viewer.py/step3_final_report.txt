  "purpose": "A filesystem tree viewer for local directories, displaying directory structure and icons.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directory listings via os.listdir, os.path functions for path manipulations.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Filesystem data flows from os.listdir into GUI components for display; no data is transmitted or executed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard libraries and patterns, no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple, standard filesystem tree viewer using Python's os and pyface libraries. It reads local directory contents and displays them with icons, with no network activity, data processing beyond local filesystem access, or suspicious patterns. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal risk associated with filesystem data being untrusted is acknowledged but does not constitute a security threat. The scores across reports are consistent; the slight elevation in one report's security risk score (0.1) is justified but still negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward filesystem viewer with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the minimal risk is justified by the nature of filesystem data handling.",
