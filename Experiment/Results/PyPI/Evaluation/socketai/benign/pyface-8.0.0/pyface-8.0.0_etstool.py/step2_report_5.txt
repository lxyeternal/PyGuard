  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The script automates environment setup, testing, documentation, and cleanup using standard subprocess calls, file operations, and environment variables. The sources and sinks are typical for such automation scripts.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The subprocess calls are controlled and rely on external tools (EDM, pip), which are standard. CPU feature parsing and EDM location are typical environment configuration steps.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, with no malicious intent or sabotage. Confidence is high (1), malware score is 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar automation for environment management, with reliance on environment variables and subprocess commands. The dynamic construction of commands from user input and environment variables is noted.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No evidence of malicious behavior. Use of subprocess without input sanitization is standard but warrants caution. No obfuscation or hidden malicious code.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The script is a standard environment and testing automation tool. Malware score is 0, confidence high (~0.9). Slight security concern about reliance on external inputs but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar project management automation with environment setup, testing, and documentation. Uses subprocess and file operations based on user input.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or obfuscation. The subprocess calls are typical, and no malicious payloads are detected.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate automation script, no signs of malware. Malware score 0, confidence ~0.9.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The script manages environments, testing, and documentation, constructing commands from CLI args and environment variables.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or malicious code. The subprocess calls are standard, but reliance on external inputs could be exploited if inputs are malicious.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility script, low risk. Malware score 0, confidence ~0.85.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar environment management and testing automation, with subprocess commands based on user inputs and environment variables.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The subprocess usage is typical, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate project automation code, malware score 0, confidence ~0.9.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is standard for environment management and testing automation.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report.\n\n- **Risk Score:** While some reports mention potential risks due to subprocess command construction from untrusted inputs, the overall code does not exhibit malicious intent. The risk is low but should be acknowledged.\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (some potential for exploitation if inputs are malicious, but no active malicious behavior)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis package is a legitimate, well-structured automation script for environment setup, testing, and documentation. No signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious obfuscation are present. The only concern is the potential risk associated with executing subprocess commands based on external inputs, which is typical for such scripts but warrants cautious usage.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Ensure proper validation of user inputs if extended.\n- Keep dependencies and environment handling secure.\n- No immediate threat detected.",
