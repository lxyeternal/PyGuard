  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured automation tool for environment setup, testing, and documentation. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily associated with subprocess execution based on external inputs, which is standard for such scripts but should be validated in sensitive contexts."
