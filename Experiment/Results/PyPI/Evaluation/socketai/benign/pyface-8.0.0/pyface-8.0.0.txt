      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-structured automation tool for environment setup, testing, and documentation. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily associated with subprocess execution based on external inputs, which is standard for such scripts but should be validated in sensitive contexts."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard example of embedding a Python shell within a GUI application. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or security breaches. The primary concern is the inherent risk of executing untrusted user input in the embedded shell, which is typical for such features. Overall, the code is safe with low security risk, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent."

The main concern is the embedded Python shell, which could execute arbitrary code if misused, but this is typical for such tools. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the inherent risk of embedded scripting environments without any malicious payloads."
