  "purpose": "Create and display a simple 'Hello World' graphical application window using the pyface library.",
  "sources": "Imports from pyface.api, class definition, and main() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output points are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing libraries, defining a GUI window, creating the window in main(), and starting the event loop.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious imports. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard GUI application structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a basic GUI application using the pyface library. It defines a MainWindow class with a title and content, then initializes and runs the GUI in the main() function. There are no external data inputs, no suspicious code patterns, or behaviors indicating malicious intent. All elements serve a simple GUI purpose without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign example of a GUI application with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
