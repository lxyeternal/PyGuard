{
  "purpose": "To create a simple graphical 'Hello World' application using the pyface library.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external or untrusted input; it only imports modules and creates GUI components.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive actions such as network communication, file access, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only manages internal GUI components.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code appears straightforward and consistent with a typical GUI application.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the pyface.api module to build a GUI window with a heading label displaying 'Hello World'. It defines a MainWindow class inheriting from ApplicationWindow, setting the window title and creating GUI content. The main() function initializes the GUI and window, then starts the event loop. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or credential handling. The code structure is standard, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, simple GUI application with no malicious or security concerns. It solely creates a 'Hello World' window using pyface and runs the event loop. No suspicious activity, data leaks, or malicious intent detected.",
