{
  "purpose": "A simple GUI 'Hello World' application demonstrating basic pyface library usage.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, data, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only creates a static GUI element.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static GUI application with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It imports only standard GUI components, creates a window with a label, and runs an event loop. No security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are evident. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, educational 'Hello World' GUI application with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
  "malware": 0.0,
  "securityRisk": 0.0,
