  "purpose": "To create and display a simple 'Hello World' graphical user interface application using the pyface library.",
  "sources": "Imports from pyface.api, specifically ApplicationWindow, GUI, and HeadingText.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Input source is the import statements; flow proceeds through class definition and main execution, with no data leaks or malicious flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports GUI components, defines a straightforward application window with a label, and runs the GUI event loop. There are no external data inputs, no network connections, no dynamic code execution, and no credential handling. The code appears to be a standard example for a GUI application, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign example of a simple GUI application. It does not contain malware or security risks. It appears to be a standard, non-malicious sample code for educational purposes.",
