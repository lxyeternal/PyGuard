  "purpose": "A sorter that arranges folders before files in a filesystem viewer.",
  "sources": "The 'element' parameter passed to the 'category' method, which is expected to be a filesystem path or object.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; the code only reads the 'element' parameter.",
  "flows": "Input 'element' is checked with 'isdir(element)' to determine its category; no further data flow or external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and purpose-specific. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'FileSorter' inheriting from 'ViewerSorter' with a method 'category' that uses 'isdir(element)' to classify filesystem elements. It assigns category 0 for directories and 1 for files, solely for sorting purposes. The implementation is simple, standard, and relies on the Python standard library. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The code's logic is transparent, with no obfuscation or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-specific filesystem sorter with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
