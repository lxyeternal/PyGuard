  "purpose": "Define the version of the Ansible project and include licensing information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'ansible_version' variable assignment and comments indicating license and copyright.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only assigns a static string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code contains standard licensing comments and a simple variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal header fragment establishing licensing info and defining a version string for Ansible. No external input, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present. The license comments are standard practice. The variable assignment is static and straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata or documentation header for the project. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns.",
