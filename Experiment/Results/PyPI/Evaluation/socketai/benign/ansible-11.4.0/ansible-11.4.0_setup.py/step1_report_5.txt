{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script is a minimal configuration for a Python package, mainly for compatibility with older packaging tools. It delegates configuration to setup.cfg.",
  "sources": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with no arguments, reading no external input or data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows, as the code does not process any untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The script is extremely minimal, but contains no suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. It simply delegates to setup.cfg.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, minimal setup.py file for Python packaging, intended for compatibility purposes. It imports setuptools and calls setup() with default parameters. No external input handling, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code appears legitimate and typical for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard minimal setup.py file with no malicious behavior or security issues. It does not perform any harmful actions and is not suspicious.",
