  "purpose": "Minimal setup.py for compatibility with older tools, delegating configuration to setup.cfg.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static code with import and function call.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or output sinks present.",
  "flows": "None; setup() is called with no parameters, no data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with no arguments, serving as a compatibility shim. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The code is minimal and standard for Python packaging. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, with high confidence. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup.py script with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and appropriate, with scores reflecting the benign nature. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
