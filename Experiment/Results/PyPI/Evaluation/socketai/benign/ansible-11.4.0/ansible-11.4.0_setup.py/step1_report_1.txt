{
  "purpose": "The setup.py script is used to facilitate the installation and distribution of a Python package, mainly for compatibility with older tools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'setuptools' module import and executes the 'setup()' function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'setuptools' → calling setup() without parameters; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The script is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the standard 'setuptools' library and calls the 'setup()' function with default parameters. It contains only comments about licensing and instructions, with no additional logic or data handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present, and it appears to be a typical setup file for a Python package. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves its purpose for package installation compatibility and does not pose any security risks.",
