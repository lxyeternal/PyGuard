{
  "purpose": "The code provides a minimal setup configuration for a Python package, mainly for compatibility with older packaging tools.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'setuptools' library and the setup() function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data processing or output generation occurs.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import 'setup' from 'setuptools' and invoke setup(). No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very simple and standard for a setup script; no unusual code constructs or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setup' function from the 'setuptools' library and calls it with default parameters. It contains only comments about licensing and usage recommendations. No user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present. The structure is minimal and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It serves a typical purpose in package distribution without any suspicious or malicious code.",
