  "purpose": "A simple CLI script that displays version information and help message.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments parsed via argparse, specifically '--version'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network calls.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments flows to argparse processing, leading to version display or help output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard CLI utility that handles '--version' and help output. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle sensitive data. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external dependencies or risky operations indicate it is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are justified and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its safety, and the scoring is appropriate.",
