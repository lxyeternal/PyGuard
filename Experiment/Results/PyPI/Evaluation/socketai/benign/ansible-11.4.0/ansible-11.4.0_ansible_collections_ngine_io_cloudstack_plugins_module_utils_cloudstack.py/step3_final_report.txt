  "purpose": "A class-based utility for managing CloudStack resources within Ansible, handling API interactions, resource queries, tagging, and error management.",
  "sources": "User input parameters, environment variables, API responses from CloudStack.",
  "sinks": "API calls for resource management, error messages, polling jobs, potential data exposure through error outputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters/env vars → API request → API response → internal attributes → results and error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper and resource manager for CloudStack, with proper credential handling, error management, and resource querying. No malicious code, obfuscation, or sabotage indicators are present. The logic is standard, and the security posture is consistent with legitimate resource management tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured CloudStack resource management utility for Ansible, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
