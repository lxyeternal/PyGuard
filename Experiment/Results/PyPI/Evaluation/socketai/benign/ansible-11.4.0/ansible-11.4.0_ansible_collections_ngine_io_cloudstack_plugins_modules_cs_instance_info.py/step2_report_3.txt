  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a standard Ansible module for querying CloudStack API, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Evidence:** The code performs API calls based on user parameters, processes responses, and outputs structured data. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are observed.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. Given the analysis, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. The securityRisk is low, considering the code's purpose and structure.\n- **Justification:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. No issues found.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the code as a typical API wrapper for CloudStack, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Evidence:** The code uses standard API calls, processes data safely, and relies on external API responses.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The report's assessment appears accurate.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior or malware indications.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard module for gathering instance info, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Evidence:** Uses user input parameters, API calls, and data processing routines that are standard for such modules.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The report's conclusion is consistent.\n- **Justification:** No malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward data retrieval module with no malicious behavior.\n- **Evidence:** No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The assessment is justified.\n- **Justification:** The code is a typical API wrapper, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, it confirms the code's legitimacy as a data gathering module.\n- **Evidence:** Uses standard API calls, processes data safely, and does not exhibit suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The report's conclusion is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malware or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports agree that the code is a standard, legitimate Ansible module for CloudStack resource info retrieval.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** All reports assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, given the code's purpose and structure.\n\n### My Reasoned Final Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code relies on external API responses and user parameters but does not process untrusted data in dangerous ways.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The logic is standard for such modules, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. I concur with their assessments and scores, and I would assign the following scores:\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis indicates a safe, legitimate module with no security concerns.",
