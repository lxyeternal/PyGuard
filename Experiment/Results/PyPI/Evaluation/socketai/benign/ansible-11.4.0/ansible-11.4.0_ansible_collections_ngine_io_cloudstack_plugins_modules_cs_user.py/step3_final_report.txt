{
  "purpose": "Manage users on CloudStack-based clouds, including create, update, delete, enable, disable, lock, and unlock operations.",
  "sources": "User input parameters (e.g., username, password, email), API responses from CloudStack (listUsers, createUser, updateUser, etc.)",
  "sinks": "API calls that modify user state, registration of API keys, retrieval of user data",
  "flows": "Input parameters → API request formation → API call execution → API response handling → final output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; standard API interactions; passwords handled securely with 'no_log'",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward resource management module for CloudStack users, performing typical API interactions with proper handling of sensitive data. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The logic flow from input validation to API calls and response processing is clear and standard. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's transparency and security posture. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident, and the code adheres to best practices for such management modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured CloudStack user management module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or high security risk. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the code review.",
