  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'yamale' Python package, used for YAML schema validation.",
  "sources": "Reads files: README.md, LICENSE, yamale/VERSION; uses package dependencies and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data processed or transmitted within this script.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file, loads README and LICENSE content for package description, passes data to setup(). No data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. The code follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions from setuptools, reads documentation and version info from local files, and calls setup() with standard package metadata. No external input handling or network operations are present. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration script for a Python package. It appears benign with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
