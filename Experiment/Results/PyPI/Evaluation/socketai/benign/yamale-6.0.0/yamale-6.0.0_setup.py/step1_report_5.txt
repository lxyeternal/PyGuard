  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior. The code uses standard setuptools procedures. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. File reads are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reading external files for description and version info, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No user input handling, no network activity beyond dependency installation (which is expected). No suspicious or malicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code flows detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard practices for package configuration and distribution.",
