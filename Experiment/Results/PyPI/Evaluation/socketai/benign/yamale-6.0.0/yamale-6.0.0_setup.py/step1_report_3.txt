  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'yamale' Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md', 'LICENSE', and 'yamale/VERSION' files, and importing setup-related functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Reading files during setup; no untrusted data flow to execution beyond standard setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for Python packaging. It reads project metadata from files and invokes setuptools.setup() with appropriate parameters. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no malicious behavior are evident. The usage of 'find_packages()' and standard dependencies is typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for packaging the 'yamale' project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
