{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging the 'yamale' project, reading static metadata files and configuring package installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads static files: README.md, LICENSE, yamale/VERSION",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; the script only calls setup() with static data",
  "flows": "Reads files and passes data to setuptools.setup() without dynamic or untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks: reading static files for metadata, defining package info, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The code structure is straightforward and aligns with standard packaging practices. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe package configuration. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
