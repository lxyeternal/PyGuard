  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'yamale' Python package, used for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads from README.md, LICENSE, and yamale/VERSION files to obtain package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data is sent or processed insecurely.",
  "flows": "Reads metadata files to configure package setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures using setuptools, reading metadata files and configuring package details. It does not include any dynamic code execution, network communication, or suspicious behavior. Usage of 'open' for reading files is safe here, assuming the files are trusted and part of the package source. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or hidden code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and standard for Python packaging.",
