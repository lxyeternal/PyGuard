  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the claims, check for inconsistencies, and determine appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe a simple import statement: `from .parser import parse`.\n- No data input, output, or processing is described.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- All reports assign very high confidence (mostly 1 or 0.9).\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, indicating no malicious activity is suspected.\n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with benign import statements.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Straightforward import, no anomalies, no data flow.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is a minimal, benign import statement. No issues found. The slightly less than perfect confidence (0.9) is reasonable given the minimal context.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, benign import, no anomalies.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nBenign, standard import. The perfect confidence score aligns with the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same benign import, no anomalies.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, consistent with the other reports. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same benign import, no anomalies.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nBenign and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same benign import, no anomalies.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe the same minimal import statement.  \n- **Malware risk:** All are correctly scored 0, as no malicious activity is present or suggested.  \n- **Obfuscation:** All are scored 0, consistent with the transparent code.  \n- **Security risk:** Correctly scored 0, as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n**Any inconsistencies or errors?**  \nNo. All assessments are consistent and justified based on the provided code snippets.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are appropriate and align with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates (for completeness):**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that appropriately.",
