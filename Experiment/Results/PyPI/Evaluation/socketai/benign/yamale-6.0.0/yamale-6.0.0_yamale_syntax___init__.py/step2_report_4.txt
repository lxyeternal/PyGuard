  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Content:** A simple import statement: `from .parser import parse`\n- **Findings:** No data flows, no anomalies, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9 (high confidence that it's benign).\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues detected. The high confidence is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Content:** Same import statement as above.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no data flow, standard code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is benign. The confidence score is perfect, and no issues are found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Content:** Same import statement.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no data flow, standard import.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous findings; no malicious behavior. The confidence is slightly lower but still high.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Content:** Same import statement.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no data flow, standard import.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, benign. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Content:** Same import statement.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no data flow, standard import.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with others; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n\n- All reports analyze the same code snippet: a straightforward import statement.\n- There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n- The confidence scores are appropriate, given the minimal code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- Since all reports are identical in content and reasoning, consolidating the assessment is reasonable.\n- The malware scores should remain at 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated scores are correctly at 0.\n- The security risk scores are correctly at 0, given the lack of any suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0**  \n\nThe code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as a simple, benign import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.",
