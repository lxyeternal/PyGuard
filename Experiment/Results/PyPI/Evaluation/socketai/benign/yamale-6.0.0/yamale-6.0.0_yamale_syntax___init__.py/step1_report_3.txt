  "purpose": "Import the 'parse' function from a local module named 'parser'.",
  "sources": "The code imports from a local module; no external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable within this single line of code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a function from a relative module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. Since the code is minimal and only involves an import statement, it does not establish any input sources or data sinks that could be exploited. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detectable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a standard import operation with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
