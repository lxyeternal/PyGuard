  "purpose": "Import the 'parse' function from a local module named 'parser'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'parser' and the 'parse' function within it.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present, as the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations beyond importing.",
  "flows": "The code flows from the import statement to any subsequent code that would use 'parse' (not shown).",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and appears standard. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This code snippet performs a straightforward import of a function named 'parse' from a local module. There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows observable here. The structure is typical for modular Python code, and no suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as an import statement for modular functionality. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
