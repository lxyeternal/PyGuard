  "purpose": "Utility functions for type checking, iteration, and subclass retrieval, likely for introspection or data processing tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from parameters of functions: 's' in isstr, 'obj' in is_list, is_map, get_keys; 'iterable' in get_iter; 'cls' in get_subclasses.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network, file, or system modifications; no untrusted data handling or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into type check functions, and subclass relationships are examined through recursive subclass discovery.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or suspicious operations detected. The get_subclasses function performs recursion with class introspection, which is typical for meta-programming.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for type checks, iteration, and retrieving subclasses of a class. It relies on standard Python introspection methods. The get_subclasses function recursively yields subclasses of a given class, maintaining a set to avoid repeats. There are no network operations, data leaks, or malicious system modifications. The code does not process untrusted input in a way that would cause harm or leak information; it mainly performs introspection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility set for type checking, iteration, and class introspection. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is typical meta-programming code without any suspicious patterns or operations.",
