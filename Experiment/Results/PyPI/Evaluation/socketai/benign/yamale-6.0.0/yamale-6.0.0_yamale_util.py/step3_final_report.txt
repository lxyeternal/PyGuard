  "purpose": "Utility functions for type checking, data iteration, and class hierarchy introspection.",
  "sources": "Type checks (isinstance), get_keys (mapping/list), get_iter (mapping/list), get_subclasses (class hierarchy).",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "Type checks and data retrieval functions operate on input data; get_subclasses recursively enumerates class hierarchies without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; functions are straightforward and standard. to_unicode is a placeholder returning input as-is, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for type checking and class introspection. get_subclasses safely enumerates subclasses with recursion and safeguards. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The functions do not process untrusted data in a harmful way, nor do they perform network operations or data exfiltration. The code is clear, standard, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of utility functions for class and data type introspection with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are accurate and appropriate.",
