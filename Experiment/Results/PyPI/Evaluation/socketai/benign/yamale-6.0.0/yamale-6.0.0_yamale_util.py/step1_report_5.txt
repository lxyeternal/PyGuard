  "purpose": "Utility functions for type checking, iteration, and class hierarchy traversal",
  "sources": "None of the functions read input or data from external sources; no data acquisition code present",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or execution effects; functions mainly perform type checks and recursion",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow paths leading to vulnerabilities; class hierarchy traversal is safe and contained",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected; code appears straightforward and standard",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for type checking (isstr, is_list, is_map), data conversion (to_unicode), data retrieval (get_keys, get_iter), and class hierarchy traversal (get_subclasses). All functions are implemented with standard Python practices. No external input is read, no data is processed from untrusted sources, and there are no suspicious behaviors such as network activity, system modifications, or obfuscated code. The recursive get_subclasses function safely yields subclasses of a given class, with proper checks and set tracking to prevent infinite recursion. No malicious or malicious-looking code, backdoors, or sabotage elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for type checks, iteration, and class hierarchy traversal. It is well-structured, straightforward, and does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks.",
