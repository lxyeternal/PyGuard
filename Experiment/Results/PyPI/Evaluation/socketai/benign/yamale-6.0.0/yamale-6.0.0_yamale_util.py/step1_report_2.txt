  "purpose": "Utility functions for type checking, data conversion, and recursive subclass enumeration.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes (e.g., __subclasses__) and input parameters for functions like get_subclasses.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to or modify external systems or sensitive data; it primarily performs introspection.",
  "flows": "The get_subclasses function retrieves subclasses via recursion, yielding class objects without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data handling; no obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions for type checks and a recursive generator to retrieve subclasses. The get_subclasses function leverages __subclasses__() method safely for introspection. No external inputs, outputs, or network activities are present. No evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. Overall, it appears to be a benign utility module used for class introspection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for class introspection with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates purely within Python's runtime environment without affecting external systems or data.",
