{
  "purpose": "The code validates YAML files against schemas, supporting directory traversal, exclusion patterns, multiprocessing, and multiple YAML parsers.",
  "sources": "Filesystem paths, user inputs, glob patterns for YAML files, schema files, and data files.",
  "sinks": "Validation functions from yamale library, print statements for progress and errors.",
  "flows": "User inputs or paths -> filesystem traversal -> schema discovery -> data validation via yamale -> output results or errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard validation tasks with proper exception handling, multiprocessing for performance, and flexible schema/data discovery. No code execution of untrusted data, network activity, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The use of multiprocessing and filesystem operations is typical for such utilities. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate YAML validation utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. All reports correctly assess its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risks. The overall risk is minimal, primarily due to filesystem and multiprocessing operations, which are standard. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and pose no supply chain security concern.",
