  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate YAML validation utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. All reports correctly assess its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risks. The overall risk is minimal, primarily due to filesystem and multiprocessing operations, which are standard. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and pose no supply chain security concern."
