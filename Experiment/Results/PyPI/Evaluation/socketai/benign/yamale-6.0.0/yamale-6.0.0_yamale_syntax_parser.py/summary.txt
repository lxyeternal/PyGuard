  "conclusion": "The code implements a controlled expression parser and evaluator with validation and environment restrictions. While residual risk exists due to potential validation bypasses (e.g., unary operators) and reliance on trusted validators, no malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. The use of eval() remains a concern but is reasonably mitigated. Overall, the implementation appears secure for trusted validator sets, with a moderate residual risk."
