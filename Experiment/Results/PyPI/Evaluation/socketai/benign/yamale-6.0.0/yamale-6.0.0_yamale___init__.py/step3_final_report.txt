  "purpose": "Import statements for local modules related to schema validation, testing, error handling, and versioning in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Local module imports: .yamale, .yamale_testcase, .yamale_error, .version",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication present",
  "flows": "Import statements do not involve data flow; they simply load modules at runtime",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; straightforward import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from local modules, typical in package setup. No data processing, network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input is present. The code is standard and benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of import statements with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are accurate and should remain at zero.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
