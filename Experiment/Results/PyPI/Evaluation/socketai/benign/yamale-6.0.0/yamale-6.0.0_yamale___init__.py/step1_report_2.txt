  "purpose": "Import statements for a Python package related to schema validation and testing.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; import statements reference local modules and version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted sources; only imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "Only standard import statements; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions and classes from local modules (.yamale, .yamale_testcase, .yamale_error, .version). There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data handling. It appears to be a straightforward module import section typical in Python packages, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment solely contains import statements for a schema validation library and its components. There is no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks evident in this snippet.",
