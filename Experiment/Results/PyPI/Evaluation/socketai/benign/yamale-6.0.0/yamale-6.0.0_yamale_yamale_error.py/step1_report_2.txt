  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class YamaleError for handling validation errors related to results, formatting error messages based on invalid results.",
  "sources": "The constructor receives 'results' as input, which is used to generate the error message.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious activity; it primarily processes data for exception handling.",
  "flows": "Input 'results' flows through filtering and string joining to form the error message, then is stored as class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The lambda function filters invalid results, and the class inheritance is standard.",
  "analysis": "The class extends ValueError and customizes error message generation based on validation results. The use of list, filter, lambda, and string join is standard Python practice. There is no code injection, external network access, or suspicious data handling. The code is straightforward exception handling logic with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The overall structure and content appear benign and typical for error handling in validation processes.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a simple custom exception class for validation errors with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a normal part of validation workflows with no suspicious behaviors.",
