  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class YamaleError for handling validation errors related to a results list.",
  "sources": "The results parameter passed to the constructor, specifically the filtering and string conversion operations.",
  "sinks": "The join operation on the filtered results to produce an error message string.",
  "flows": "Results are filtered for invalid entries, converted to strings, joined with newlines, and stored as the exception message.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of ValueError that formats a list of validation results, filtering out valid entries and joining invalid ones into an error message. The filtering uses a lambda to check isValid() on each result. There are no external input sources, no network or file I/O, and no obfuscated or malicious patterns. The structure appears straightforward, focusing solely on error message formatting based on provided validation results.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious class definition for error handling. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
