{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling Yamale validation errors.",
  "sources": "The class takes a 'results' object as input, which is expected to be a list of validation results.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs an error message string from 'results' but does not perform any untrusted data sinks or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Input 'results' is processed through filtering and string joining to form an error message; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The class extends ValueError to create a custom exception. It filters 'results' to include only invalid entries, converts them to strings, and joins them into a message. The message is stored in 'self.message' and the original 'results' in 'self.results'. The code is straightforward and appears to be standard exception handling code for validation errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external data transmission, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign custom exception class for validation errors. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected.",
