  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it against the original code.\n\n**Summary of the original code:**\n- Defines `YamaleError` inheriting from `ValueError`.\n- Constructor takes `results`, filters invalid results (`not x.isValid()`), converts them to strings, joins with newline.\n- Stores the message in `self.message` and the full `results` in `self.results`.\n- No external data sinks, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All describe the class as a straightforward custom exception for validation errors.\n- Emphasize that the code filters results, constructs an error message, and stores relevant data.\n- Consistently state no suspicious behavior, no external data flow, no obfuscation, no malware.\n- The logic described matches the original code exactly.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating certainty about benign nature.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of Scores & Logic:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign `0`, as there's no indication of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are `0`, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** All are `0`, as the code is purely for exception handling with no external interactions or vulnerabilities.\n\n### **Any issues or inconsistencies?**\n\n- The reports are very consistent and accurate.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond the benign description.\n- The code does not perform any dangerous operations, nor does it contain obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential for score adjustments:**\n\n- Since the code is simple, and all reports agree, the scores seem appropriate.\n- The only point to consider: if the `results` object could be maliciously crafted to cause issues in the `str()` conversion or `isValid()` method, but given the context, this is unlikely and not indicated.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — straightforward, readable code.\n\n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code is a typical pattern for custom validation exceptions.\n- No assumptions about external data or side effects are justified here.\n- The consistent and accurate descriptions across reports reinforce the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the provided reports and code analysis, **the scores are appropriate**. The code is benign, and there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Final statement:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No changes to scores are necessary.",
