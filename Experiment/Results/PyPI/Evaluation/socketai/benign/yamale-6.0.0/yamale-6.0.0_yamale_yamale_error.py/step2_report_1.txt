  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines `YamaleError`, a subclass of `ValueError`.\n- The constructor takes a `results` list.\n- Filters `results` to include only invalid entries (`not x.isValid()`).\n- Converts these invalid results to strings and joins them with newlines.\n- Sets this string as `self.message` and passes it to the superclass constructor.\n- Stores the original `results` in `self.results`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code's logic is straightforward and matches the description: it creates a custom exception for validation errors, including details about invalid results.\n- No external data sinks, network calls, or file I/O are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The code appears correct and standard for such a purpose.\n- The use of `super()` with the class name is acceptable but could be simplified with `super().__init__()`.\n- The `self.message` attribute is redundant because `Exception` already stores the message in `args[0]`. However, this is not a security concern, just a style note.\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** 0. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0. The code is benign, serving as a custom exception class with no security implications.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- All reports uniformly describe the code as benign, straightforward, and typical for error handling.\n- No suspicious behavior, external data handling, or vulnerabilities are indicated.\n- The logic is consistent across reports and matches the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple, standard custom exception class with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports support this conclusion, emphasizing its benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and appropriate for its purpose. No changes to scores are necessary.",
