{
  "purpose": "Define a custom error class 'YamaleError' that formats and stores validation results when validation fails.",
  "sources": "The 'results' parameter passed to the constructor, specifically the list of validation results processed within the class.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to files, network, or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Input 'results' is processed to filter invalid results and generate an error message; no external flow beyond constructor initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. The use of lambda and list filtering is standard Python.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of ValueError, taking 'results' as input. It filters the 'results' list to find invalid entries using 'not x.isValid()', then joins their string representations into a message. This message is stored as 'self.message' and also in the exception args. The structure appears typical for error handling in validation processes. No external data, network calls, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a custom exception class for validation errors, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It primarily formats and stores validation results.",
