{
  "purpose": "Define a custom error class 'YamaleError' for handling validation results that are invalid.",
  "sources": "The constructor receives 'results' as input, which is used in the error message generation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data are present; the code only processes 'results' internally.",
  "flows": "Input 'results' is processed to generate an error message, but no external data flows or actions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; straightforward class definition with standard string operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception inheriting from ValueError. It filters the 'results' list for invalid entries, joins their string representations into a message, and stores 'results'. No external input handling, network activity, or suspicious behavior observed. The logic is standard for custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a custom exception class with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
