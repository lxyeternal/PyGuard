  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class YamaleError for validation results, filtering invalid entries and constructing an error message.",
  "sources": "Filtering results with lambda x: not x.isValid(), converting filtered results to strings, joining with newline.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data flow or output beyond exception message construction.",
  "flows": "Results are filtered, converted to strings, joined, and passed to superclass; stored in self.results and self.message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation. Use of super() could be simplified but is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple custom exception class that filters validation results for invalid entries, constructs an error message, and stores relevant data. No external data flows, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The code is clear, standard, and benign. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0 and risk score of 0. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. The only minor note is reliance on x.isValid(), but this is typical for such validation results and not inherently risky.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a custom validation exception class with no malicious or security concerns. The provided reports are accurate and consistent. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
