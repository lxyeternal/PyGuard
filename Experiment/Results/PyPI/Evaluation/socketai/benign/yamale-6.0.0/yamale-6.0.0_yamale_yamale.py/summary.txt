  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign schema validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk. External dependencies should be verified separately, but within this snippet, the code is safe."
