  "purpose": "Provides functions to parse YAML schemas and data, create schema objects, and validate data against schemas.",
  "sources": "readers.parse_yaml function calls, external modules (.schema, .yamale_error)",
  "sinks": "parse_yaml outputs, schema.validate method",
  "flows": "Input YAML content or file -> parse_yaml -> create Schema object -> validate data with schema",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import of 'readers' inside functions; reliance on external modules without internal validation",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard schema parsing and validation with exception handling. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are present. External modules' safety is assumed. No suspicious patterns or malicious code are evident. The reliance on external 'readers' and schema classes is typical but warrants external validation. Overall, the code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign schema validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk. External dependencies should be verified separately, but within this snippet, the code is safe.",
