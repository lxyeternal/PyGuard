{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to create and validate schemas and data using YAML files, likely for data validation purposes within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from files specified by 'path' parameters and content provided directly to functions.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with schema validation logic and can raise exceptions, but does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Data is read from YAML files or content, parsed into raw schemas or data, then processed through schema validation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs observed. No evidence of data exfiltration or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports local modules for schema and error handling, parses YAML content, creates schema objects, and validates data. It handles errors explicitly and raises exceptions on invalid data. The reading of YAML content is encapsulated in functions, and no external or network activity is performed. There is no obfuscated or suspicious code behavior. The design appears standard for schema validation workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of schema creation and validation using YAML files, with proper error handling and no signs of malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior. It is likely part of a larger validation framework without any malicious intent.",
