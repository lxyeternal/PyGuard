{
  "purpose": "Read the version information from an external file named 'VERSION' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a file located at the path constructed by joining the script's directory and 'VERSION'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted or user-provided data are present; the code only reads a local file.",
  "flows": "The file path is constructed from the script's directory, then data is read from the file and assigned to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are observed. The code reads from a static file which is a common pattern for versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code determines its own directory, constructs a path to a 'VERSION' file, and reads its contents as the version string. There is no processing of untrusted input, no network activity, and no suspicious code constructs. It appears to be a standard method for maintaining version info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, safe, and does not exhibit malicious behavior. It simply loads version data from a local file, which is a common and safe pattern.",
