{
  "purpose": "Read the version information from a file named 'VERSION' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "Reading from a file located at os.path.join(root, FNAME), where root is derived from the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "Assigning the read data to the variable __version__, which could be used elsewhere in the code.",
  "flows": "File content is read from the filesystem and stored in __version__; no untrusted input flows directly into security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; standard file reading; no obfuscated or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code computes its own directory path, constructs a path to a 'VERSION' file, and reads its content into a variable. This is a common pattern for loading version info. No external data is fetched, no user input, and no suspicious functions are used. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The script's purpose is to load version info from a local file. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and appears safe. No security risks are evident.",
