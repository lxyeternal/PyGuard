  "purpose": "Read version information from a local file named 'VERSION'.",
  "sources": "Reading the contents of the 'VERSION' file located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "File reading operation; no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "File path construction -> file read operation -> storing content in __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward file read operation. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script determines its directory path, constructs a path to a file named 'VERSION', and reads its contents into a variable. This is a typical pattern for loading version info. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious data exfiltration, or unsafe behavior. The code does not handle untrusted input, nor does it perform any network operations or data manipulation beyond reading a static file.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, benign operation of reading version info from a local file. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
