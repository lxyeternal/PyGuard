{
  "purpose": "Read the version information from a file named 'VERSION' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a file specified by os.path.join(root, FNAME), which is a file in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "The data read from the file is stored in the __version__ variable; no further processing or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "The code reads the content of the VERSION file and assigns it to __version__, with no further data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code performs a straightforward file read operation without any obfuscation or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script determines its directory path, constructs the path to a file named 'VERSION', and reads its content to set a version variable. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as executing untrusted input, network communication, or data exfiltration. The code is standard for configuration or version management in a project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard implementation for reading version information from a local file. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
