  "purpose": "Read the content of a local 'VERSION' file to determine the software version.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION' file located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads a local file without processing untrusted input or executing code.",
  "flows": "Constructs the file path using the script's directory, then reads the file content into __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code determines its directory, constructs a path to 'VERSION', and reads its content into __version__. It performs a simple, standard operation with no external dependencies, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code does not process untrusted input beyond reading a static file, and there are no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for loading version information from a local file. There are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. All reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
