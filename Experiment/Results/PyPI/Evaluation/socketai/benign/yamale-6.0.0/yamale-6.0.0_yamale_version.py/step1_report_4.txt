  "purpose": "Read the version information from a file named 'VERSION' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION' file located in the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "The content of the 'VERSION' file assigned to __version__ variable; no untrusted data is used elsewhere.",
  "flows": "File path constructed from the script's directory; file contents read and stored in __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward file read operation with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code determines its own directory, constructs a path to a 'VERSION' file, reads its content as a string, and assigns it to __version__. There is no user input, no data from untrusted sources, and no malicious behavior. The file reading is standard practice for version management. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, safe operation of reading version info from a file. There are no signs of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security issues.",
