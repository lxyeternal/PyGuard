  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from a local module named 'about'.",

  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this snippet; it does not process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable here as this is a simple import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a wildcard import, which can be considered bad practice, but it is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "This snippet only performs a relative import of the 'about' module. It does not execute any code or perform data processing. No security risks or malware indicators are evident. The import might be for configuration or metadata, but it does not pose a security concern on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. It may be considered poor style due to the wildcard import but is not malicious.",
