  "purpose": "This code appears to initialize and run a web server using Flask, potentially to serve web content or APIs.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from HTTP requests handled by Flask routes.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data from requests is processed and may be returned in responses; also, environment variables or config files might be read.",
  "flows": "Data received via Flask request handlers flows from sources (HTTP request data) to sinks (response output or database calls).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious domain connections, or malicious code observed. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Flask, initializes an app, and defines a route '/' that returns a simple string. No external data sources, credentials, or network connections are evident. The code performs basic server setup with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. There are no hidden code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The server runs with default settings, serving static content. No indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are apparent in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple Flask web server implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign and intended for serving web content.",
