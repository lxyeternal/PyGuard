  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to data processing or script execution, but the specific intent cannot be determined without examining the actual code content.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from environment variables, possibly user input or system data; also imports external libraries and modules that may access external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file system access, or data transmission functions which could be used for malicious data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions through processing functions and then to sinks like network or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No clear anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are evident from the provided code. The code structure appears standard; however, without actual code, this cannot be definitively confirmed.",
  "analysis": "Based on the instruction to analyze all parts of the code, the provided snippet contains no evident malicious constructs or suspicious behavior. It employs typical Python modules and structures. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code is visible. Since the code content is not explicitly provided, the analysis assumes standard practices. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks, but the absence of specific code limits confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign based on available information, with no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. However, due to lack of detailed code, this assessment has low confidence and cannot rule out hidden malicious intent within unreviewed sections.",
  "confidence": 0.4,
  "obfuscated": 0,
