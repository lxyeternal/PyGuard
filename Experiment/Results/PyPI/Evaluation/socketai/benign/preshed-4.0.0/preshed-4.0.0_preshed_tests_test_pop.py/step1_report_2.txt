  "purpose": "Unit test for the PreshMap class, testing basic insertion and deletion functionality.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of PreshMap, access to its elements via subscript notation, calling the pop method.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data causes leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from instantiation to insertion (table[10] = 20), to retrieval (table[10]), to deletion (table.pop(30)), and again to retrieval (table[10]).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded values are typical for unit tests. No use of external input or environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code imports PreshMap from a relative module, then creates an instance. It assigns values to keys 10 and 30, verifies the assignments, deletes key 30, and re-verifies key 10. The code appears to be a straightforward unit test with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious operations. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network calls, and no data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate unit test for the PreshMap class, demonstrating basic data manipulation. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
