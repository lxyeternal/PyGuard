  "purpose": "Test function for the PreshMap class, verifying basic map operations.",
  "sources": "Instantiation of PreshMap, access and assignment to the map with integer keys.",
  "sinks": "Assertions checking the values stored in the map after operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (keys 10 and 30) are assigned to the map; subsequent assertions verify correct retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports. The code is straightforward test logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class PreshMap from a relative module, then performs basic map operations: inserting key-value pairs, retrieving them, and removing an element. All operations are standard map manipulations with no suspicious behavior. No user input, network activity, or other external data sources are involved. The test simply checks that the map behaves as expected. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign test case verifying basic functionality of the PreshMap class. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
