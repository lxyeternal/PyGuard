  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is purely static metadata assignments, with no dynamic code, input handling, or external data processing.\n   - The code snippet is just setting package metadata variables (__title__, __version__, etc.).\n   - **Conclusion:** There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code present in this snippet.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is static metadata with no malicious behavior.\n   - No flaws or logical errors are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code content.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All reports have risk scores of 0, which is justified.\n   - Since there's no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concern, a high risk score would be unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This aligns with the code's nature; no malicious behavior is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent based on assumptions.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature of this code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThis code is standard package metadata declarations with no malicious or security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo concerns or anomalies are present. The reports are thorough and accurate.",
