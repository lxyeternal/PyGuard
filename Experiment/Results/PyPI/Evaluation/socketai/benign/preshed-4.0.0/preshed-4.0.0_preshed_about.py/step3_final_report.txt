  "purpose": "Package metadata declarations including title, version, author, and description.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments (__title__, __version__, __summary__, __uri__, __author__, __email__, __license__, __release__).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or execution beyond static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of static metadata variables with no dynamic or executable content.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static metadata with no functions, input handling, network operations, or dynamic code. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. The confidence level is high (1) due to the static, straightforward nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign package metadata with no malicious intent or security concerns. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No further action or revision is necessary.",
