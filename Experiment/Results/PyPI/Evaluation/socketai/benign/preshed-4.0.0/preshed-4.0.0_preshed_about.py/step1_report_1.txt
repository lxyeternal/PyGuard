  "purpose": "Metadata declarations for the 'preshed' Python package, including version, author, license, and description information.",
  "sources": "Constants and string assignments at the top of the module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to variable assignments; no data from untrusted sources processed or passed to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code constructs observed. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments setting package metadata such as title, version, summary, URL, author, email, license, and release status. There are no functions, external input handling, or operations that could lead to malicious activity. The code appears to be standard package metadata commonly found in __init__.py or similar files. No indicators of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata for the package 'preshed' and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It provides descriptive information about the package but does not perform any operations that could be malicious.",
