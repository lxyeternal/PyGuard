  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'preshed' Python package.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting module-level variables (__title__, __version__, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this is purely metadata assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward variable assignments for package metadata, including title, version, summary, URI, author, email, license, and release status. There are no dynamic or external data inputs, no code execution, and no suspicious constructs. The metadata appears standard and benign, providing information about the package without any signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard metadata declaration for a Python package with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
