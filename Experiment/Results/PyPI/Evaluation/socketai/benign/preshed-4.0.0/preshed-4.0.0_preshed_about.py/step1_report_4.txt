  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'preshed' Python library, including version, description, author, and license information.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains variable assignments with static strings and boolean values.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or transmitted, and there are no untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flow since there are no inputs or outputs or data processing operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code only assigns static metadata values. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments that provide metadata about the package, such as title, version, summary, URI, author, email, license, and release status. There are no input, output, or data processing components, and no external calls or dynamic code execution. This is typical package metadata, not executable logic or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely informational, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard package metadata definition without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
