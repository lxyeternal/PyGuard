{
  "purpose": "Setup script for building and packaging the 'preshed' Python package with Cython extensions.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata from 'about.py' and 'README.md', importing build and setup modules, and reading environment variables indirectly via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network connections, file manipulations, or system commands executed based on untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; environment variables or inputs are used only for configuration, and no data is sent over the network or written to files based on untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic detected. The code primarily manages build configurations, file cleanup, and setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup, including compiling Cython extensions, cleaning build artifacts, and reading package metadata. It utilizes standard Python packaging practices and imports known libraries like setuptools, distutils, and Cython. No code segments perform actions that could be malicious, such as network communication, file theft, or code injection. No obfuscated or intentionally misleading code structures are present. The environment variables and inputs are used in typical build contexts. All operations are related to building, cleaning, or configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for building a Python package with Cython extensions. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided analysis.",
