{
  "purpose": "The code consists of unit tests for the PreshMap data structure, verifying insertion, deletion, resizing, iteration, and edge cases.",
  "sources": "Imports pytest, preshed.maps.PreshMap, and random module; reads input data during tests.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network connections, or file I/O; all data operations are internal within tests.",
  "flows": "Test functions insert, delete, and iterate over PreshMap instances; data flows from test inputs to assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; use of random.random() is standard for test data generation and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, standard unit testing for a data structure, with no malicious code, backdoors, or external interactions. Randomness is used solely for generating test data, and assertions confirm correct behavior. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate safe, standard testing code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
