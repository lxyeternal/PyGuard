{
  "purpose": "The code implements AWS Signature Version 4 signing process for HTTP requests, generating signed headers, presigned URLs, and S3 policies for secure AWS service interactions.",
  "sources": "Input data includes request method, URL, headers, and optional payload hash; reads configuration parameters like region, service, and credentials.",
  "sinks": "Generated headers and URLs containing cryptographic signatures and authorization tokens; no external data sinks or network exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (method, URL, headers, credentials) flow into cryptographic functions to produce signed headers or URLs, with no suspicious data paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected; code structure is straightforward and adheres to AWS standards.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements AWS Signature Version 4 procedures, using standard libraries (hashlib, hmac). It handles URL parsing, header canonicalization, and signature generation securely. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The cryptographic operations follow AWS specifications, and the code does not perform any network activity or data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure AWS request signing utility with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. It is well-structured, transparent, and aligns with AWS best practices. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
