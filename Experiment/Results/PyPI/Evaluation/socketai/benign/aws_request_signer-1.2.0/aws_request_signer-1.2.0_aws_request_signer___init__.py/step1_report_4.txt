  "purpose": "This code provides a class for signing AWS requests and generating presigned URLs using AWS Signature Version 4.",
  "sources": "Reads include input parameters for signing functions, URLs, headers, and policy data; also reads timestamps for signature generation.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptographic functions (HMAC, SHA256) to generate signatures; encodes data with base64; constructs authorization headers and URLs.",
  "flows": "Input data (URLs, headers, policies) flows into signing functions; cryptographic outputs are integrated into headers and query parameters; resulting signed headers/URLs are returned for requests.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Uses standard cryptographic methods, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of AWS Signature Version 4 signing process. It correctly computes canonical headers, signs requests, and generates presigned URLs and POST policies. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. No external data leaks or insecure practices are identified. It performs cryptographic signing as intended and does not interact with external systems beyond cryptographic functions and URL/headers handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate AWS request signing utility with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It follows standard cryptographic procedures and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
