{
  "purpose": "Implement AWS request authentication for HTTP requests using AWS signature signing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from request.body, request.method, request.url, and request.headers; uses parameters provided during initialization.",
  "flows": "Request body (bytes) -> hash calculation -> sign_with_headers method -> update request.headers",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; uses external AWS signing library; no obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an AWS authentication object that signs requests with AWS signatures. It computes a SHA-256 hash of the request body if bytes are provided, otherwise uses a constant indicating unsigned payload. It then updates request headers with authentication headers generated by an external signer. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code's structure and logic are standard for AWS request signing. External library usage appears legitimate and focused on authentication.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard AWS request signing without signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It relies on an external secure library for signing and does not contain suspicious patterns or hidden functionalities.",
