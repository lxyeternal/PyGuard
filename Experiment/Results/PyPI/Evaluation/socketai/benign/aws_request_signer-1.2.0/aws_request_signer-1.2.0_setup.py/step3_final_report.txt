  "purpose": "A Python setup script for packaging the aws-request-signer library, defining metadata, dependencies, and installation instructions.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, long description string with embedded example code and placeholder credentials.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no external data flows, no network operations.",
  "flows": "None; static metadata and documentation only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder AWS credentials in the long description, which are benign and typical for documentation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py configuration script with no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, and no suspicious patterns. The embedded credentials are part of the documentation and do not execute or pose security risks. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. All signals indicate a benign package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard packaging script with no malicious intent or security issues. The placeholder credentials are harmless documentation artifacts. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0.",
