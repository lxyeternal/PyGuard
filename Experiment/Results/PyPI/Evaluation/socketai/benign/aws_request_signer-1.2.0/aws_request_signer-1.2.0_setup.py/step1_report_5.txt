  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for the 'aws-request-signer' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "The setup script reads static data from variables and dictionaries defining package metadata, dependencies, and descriptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script solely sets up package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated code detected. The script is straightforward and conventional for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script using setuptools to configure package distribution. It contains no dynamic execution, no input handling, and no malicious logic. All data appears static and related to package metadata. The code does not include any network calls, environment variable usage, or executable code beyond package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
