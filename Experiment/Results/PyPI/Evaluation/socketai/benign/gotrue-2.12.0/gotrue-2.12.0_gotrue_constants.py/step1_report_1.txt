{
  "purpose": "Define configuration constants, URLs, headers, and version information for a Python client interacting with a service.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from imported module (__version__), hardcoded URL (GOTRUE_URL), environment variables or configuration files (none shown), regex pattern (BASE64URL_REGEX).",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or external output operations observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; static data used for configuration and validation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of localhost URL in GOTRUE_URL may suggest local testing, but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines constants and configuration data for an SDK or client. It imports a version number, sets URLs, headers, expiry margins, retries, and a regex pattern. The URL points to localhost, indicating a local testing environment rather than malicious intent. The regex pattern appears to validate base64url encoding, which is standard. There are no apparent sources of untrusted data, no sinks such as network or file writes, and no flow of data from untrusted inputs. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard setup code for a client SDK, with no malware indicators.",
