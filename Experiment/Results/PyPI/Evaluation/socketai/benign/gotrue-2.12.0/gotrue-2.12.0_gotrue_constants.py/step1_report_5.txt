  "purpose": "Define configuration constants and import dependencies for a Python package related to authentication, including URL, headers, versioning, and regex patterns.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, import statements, and a version import from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only defines constants and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code does not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are detected. The localhost URL might be environment-specific but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and local modules, then defines various constants used for HTTP requests, versioning, and regex validation. The URL points to localhost, likely for local testing, and no sensitive data or malicious logic is present. The use of hardcoded values is typical for configuration files, and the regex pattern appears to validate Base64 URL-safe strings. Overall, the code is standard configuration setup without suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration module with no malicious intent or security issues. It contains no malware indicators or suspicious patterns, merely defining constants for use in a larger project.",
