{
  "purpose": "This code appears to configure constants and settings for a Python package related to authentication and API interaction, likely part of a client library for a service such as Supabase.",
  "sources": "The only input data read is the imported version string (__version__) from a local module and the hardcoded URL and regex pattern.",
  "sinks": "No sinks exist where untrusted data is processed; all data used is either hardcoded or imported, with no user input handling shown.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily defines constants and configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The URL is localhost, which suggests local testing, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and configurations for an API client, including URL, headers, expiry margin, retry settings, storage key, API version info, and a regex pattern. The use of __future__.annotations and typing hints enhances code clarity. The URL pointing to localhost indicates intended local testing environment. There is no dynamic execution, no sensitive data handling, and no obfuscated or suspicious code constructs. The import of __version__ depends on the local module but does not pose a risk itself. Overall, the code is straightforward and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign configuration module setting up constants for API interactions. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
