  "purpose": "Configuration and constants setup for a Python client interacting with an API, including versioning, URL, headers, and regex pattern.",
  "sources": "Constants and imported modules; specifically, the __version__ variable from a local module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially in the use of the __version__ in headers, but used in a non-malicious context; no direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The __version__ flows into the DEFAULT_HEADERS dictionary, which is then used for API requests. Other constants are static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded credentials beyond localhost URL, no suspicious code structures or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines constants and configuration parameters. The GOTRUE_URL points to localhost, suggesting a development environment. The header includes the package version dynamically imported from a local module. The regex pattern is a standard URL-safe base64 pattern. No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are processed. The code does not include any functions or executable logic that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard configuration code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a client library setup. The use of localhost URL and version info is typical for development or local testing. No malicious intent or security threats are evident.",
