{
  "purpose": "Define configuration constants and import version info for a Python module related to authentication and API interaction.",
  "sources": "Import statements, reading __version__ from a local module, string literals, datetime parsing",
  "sinks": "None evident; no use of untrusted data, user input, or sensitive data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets constants and configurations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard practices for defining constants and versioning. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines URL and headers with version info, sets numeric constants, and configures API versioning with a timestamp. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of __version__ and static URLs appear legitimate. Regex pattern is standard for base64 URL validation. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It primarily defines constants and version info for API interaction, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
