{
  "purpose": "Define configuration constants, URLs, headers, version info, and regex patterns for a Python SDK, primarily for local testing.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ from a local module, and uses hardcoded URL, headers, and regex pattern.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration with no data flow from external inputs.",
  "flows": "Static data used for configuration; no dynamic or external data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of localhost URL suggests local testing environment; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward configuration with constants, version info, and regex pattern. The localhost URL indicates a development setup, not malicious. No untrusted inputs, dynamic code, or obfuscation are present. All signals point to benign, static configuration code. The import of __version__ is standard practice and does not pose a risk. The regex pattern is standard for base64 URL validation. Overall, the code shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module intended for local testing or development, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and minimal security risk due to environment-specific URL usage.",
