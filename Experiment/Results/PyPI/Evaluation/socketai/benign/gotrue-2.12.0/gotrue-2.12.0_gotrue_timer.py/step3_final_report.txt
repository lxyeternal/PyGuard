  "purpose": "A Timer utility supporting both asynchronous and synchronous functions for delayed execution.",
  "sources": "Input functions provided to the Timer instance, scheduled via start() method.",
  "sinks": "Execution of the provided callback functions; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "start() method schedules the function; either via asyncio.create_task for coroutines or threading.Timer for sync functions; cancel() terminates scheduled tasks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a Timer class that supports scheduling both coroutine and regular functions with proper cleanup and status checks. It uses asyncio for async functions and threading.Timer for sync functions, managing tasks and timers appropriately. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code does not process untrusted data in a harmful way, nor does it perform network operations or system modifications. The overall assessment is that the code is a safe, utility class with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented Timer utility supporting both async and sync functions. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and a low security risk score of 0.1 reflecting minimal inherent risk.",
