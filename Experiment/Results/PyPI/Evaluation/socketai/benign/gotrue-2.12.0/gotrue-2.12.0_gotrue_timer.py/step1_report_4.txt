  "purpose": "A utility class for scheduling functions to run after a delay, supporting both asynchronous and synchronous functions.",
  "sources": "The input parameters 'seconds' and 'function' in the Timer class constructor.",
  "sinks": "The scheduled function (_function), which may execute code after delay, and can be called asynchronously or via threading timer.",
  "flows": "Input 'seconds' and 'function' are stored; start() schedules the function execution either via asyncio or threading timer; cancel() terminates scheduled tasks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns observed. The class performs standard scheduling tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Timer class that schedules execution of a provided callback after a delay, supporting both async and sync functions. It uses asyncio for asynchronous scheduling and threading for synchronous functions. The start() method properly handles coroutine functions with asyncio.create_task() and schedules other functions with threading.Timer. The cancel() method safely cancels ongoing tasks. No external data inputs, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The implementation appears standard and safe, with no anomalies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for delayed function execution with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It correctly manages asynchronous and threaded timers without any suspicious operations.",
