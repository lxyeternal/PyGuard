{
  "purpose": "A custom Timer class that schedules and executes a callback function after a specified delay, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'seconds' parameter and the 'function' callback provided during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are identified that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Input 'seconds' and 'function' flow into scheduling logic; scheduled functions execute after delay, either via asyncio or threading timer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. The code simply implements a timer mechanism.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Timer class supporting both asynchronous and synchronous functions for delayed execution. It uses asyncio for async functions and threading.Timer for sync functions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system sabotage. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present. The implementation appears straightforward, intended for scheduling tasks with no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard timer utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It safely manages scheduled callbacks without unsafe data handling or malicious activities.",
