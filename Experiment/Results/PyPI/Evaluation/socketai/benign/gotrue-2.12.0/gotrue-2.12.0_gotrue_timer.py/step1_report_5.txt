  "purpose": "A utility class for scheduling delayed execution of functions, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous functions.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via the function argument during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external communication; primarily schedules functions locally.",
  "flows": "start() method triggers execution; for async functions, schedules with asyncio.sleep; for sync functions, uses threading.Timer.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation. The code dynamically handles both sync and async functions without external data dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Timer class supporting scheduling of functions after a delay. It correctly differentiates between coroutine and regular functions. No external data is read that could lead to data leaks. The scheduling mechanisms (asyncio and threading.Timer) are standard. No suspicious or malicious code behavior, such as network connections, file manipulation, or data exfiltration, is present. The code appears to be a utility for delayed execution with proper cancellation support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a scheduling utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It securely manages scheduled tasks without external data leaks or harmful behavior.",
