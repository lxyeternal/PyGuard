{
  "purpose": "Define data models and types for an authentication and MFA system, including user, session, MFA, and OAuth responses, using Pydantic for validation.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules and libraries, including Pydantic, typing, and datetime. Reads input from the provided models and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or execute untrusted code are present. No network, file, or command execution occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows through model validation and type annotations; no execution of external or untrusted code. Model classes are instantiated with data, with validation applied.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behaviors are detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present. The code is well-structured for data validation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data models for an auth system using Pydantic and type hints, with conditional imports for compatibility across Pydantic versions. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. All imports and class definitions are standard. The logic for calculating 'expires_at' in Session is straightforward and based on current time. The code handles different scenarios with try-except blocks, ensuring compatibility. There are no indications of hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or unsafe code practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of data models for an authentication system, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and solely focused on data validation and structuring.",
