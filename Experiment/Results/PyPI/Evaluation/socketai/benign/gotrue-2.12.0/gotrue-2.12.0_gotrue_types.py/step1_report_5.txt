{
  "purpose": "This code defines data models and type annotations for an authentication SDK, including user, session, MFA, and OAuth-related structures, primarily for internal use within a larger application or SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads static definitions and type annotations; it imports external libraries (pydantic, typing_extensions); it does not process user input or external data directly.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any execution sinks such as network requests, file writes, or command execution. No untrusted data is written or sent; the models are purely data containers.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code is solely model and type definitions with no data processing or IO logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features beyond standard type annotations and conditional imports. The code handles backward compatibility for pydantic versions but does not perform any suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on defining structured data models for user authentication and MFA, with careful handling of optional fields, validation, and compatibility. It uses conditional imports for pydantic version compatibility and implements minimal validators. There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, network activity, or manipulation of external systems. The logic appears straightforward, mainly related to data validation and modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data models for an authentication SDK, with no malicious behavior detected. It does not perform any data processing outside of data validation and model setup. There are no signs of supply chain or malicious code. The overall security risk is minimal.",
