{
  "purpose": "This code defines various data models, types, and structures for an authentication and user management system, primarily using Pydantic for data validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, class attributes, and function parameters (e.g., from dicts or JSON data in API requests).",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could flow into the models via user inputs in API requests or external data sources, especially in validation functions or data fields like 'provider_token', 'access_token', 'refresh_token', and user input fields such as 'email', 'phone', and MFA codes.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input sources (e.g., API requests, user inputs) flow into the data models through their constructors or validation, potentially affecting fields like tokens, email addresses, phone numbers, or MFA codes, which are then used in authentication flows or stored in session objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code uses standard patterns for data models and version compatibility handling. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are detected. The only point of note is the use of 'model_validator_v1_v2_compat' for compatibility, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically defines data models for an auth system, including user, session, MFA, and token structures. It employs conditional imports for compatibility with different pydantic versions. All fields and methods align with typical authentication workflows. No signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or dangerous data handling mechanisms are present. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection points are evident. The code appears to be a well-structured schema definition for an authentication SDK, with no suspicious or malicious elements detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of data models for an authentication library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured schema code for user authentication workflows, with no hidden backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behaviors.",
