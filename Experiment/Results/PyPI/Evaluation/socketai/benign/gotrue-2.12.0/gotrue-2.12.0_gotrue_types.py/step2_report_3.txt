  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly states that the code defines data models for an auth system, with no direct data input or external data reading.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks or data flows involving untrusted data are present.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. The only noteworthy aspect is the version compatibility handling, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that the code is a standard, well-structured data schema with no malicious intent is accurate. The confidence level of 0.95 aligns with the thorough review.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, malware, or security risks identified. The score of malware = 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code defines data models for auth/user management, with potential data flow from untrusted sources into models via API inputs.\n- **Potential Risks:** Fields like `provider_token`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `email`, `phone`, and MFA codes could be influenced by untrusted input, but the code itself only defines data structures, not processing logic.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Use of compatibility handling is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The review correctly notes that the code is a schema setup, with no malicious behavior. The security risk is slightly higher (0.2) due to the presence of sensitive fields that could be misused if the consuming application mishandles data.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious code, but sensitive data fields should be handled carefully downstream. The malware score remains at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines data models with no external data processing beyond validation.\n- **Potential Risks:** No dynamic code execution or external calls. The code is purely declarative.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that this is a standard data schema with no malicious intent is accurate. The confidence level of 0.95 is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, malware = 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on data models for an auth SDK, with no direct data processing.\n- **Potential Risks:** No external IO or execution. The code is static definitions.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies this as a safe, schema-focused code segment. The confidence level of 1 indicates high certainty.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, malware = 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others, defining data models for an SDK.\n- **Potential Risks:** No external data handling or code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate assessment that this is purely data modeling with minimal security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, malware = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports detect obfuscation; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** The overall security risk remains very low, as these are schema definitions with no execution or external data handling.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** Given the nature of the code (schemas, data models), a very low risk score of around 0.1 is appropriate. The slight increase from 0 reflects potential misuse if downstream applications mishandle sensitive data, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, well-maintained set of data models for an authentication system, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
