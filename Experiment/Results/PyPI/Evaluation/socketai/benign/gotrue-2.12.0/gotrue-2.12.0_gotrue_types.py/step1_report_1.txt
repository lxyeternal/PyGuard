{
  "purpose": "This code defines data models and type annotations for an authentication and authorization system, including user management, MFA, OAuth, session handling, and email/link verification processes.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data directly; it primarily declares classes, types, and constants used elsewhere in the application.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present in this code that process untrusted data or execute external commands. It mainly structures data for other components.",
  "flows": "The code establishes data models used in flows such as user registration, login, MFA, and link verification but does not implement actual data flow logic or processing here.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains dynamic compatibility handling for different pydantic versions, use of a model validator, and the import of potential utility functions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are present. No obfuscated code, no suspicious comments, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a comprehensive, well-structured set of data models for an authentication system, relying on standard Python practices and pydantic for data validation. The version compatibility handling for pydantic suggests careful maintenance. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as network communication, system modification, or data exfiltration, is present in this fragment. It mainly defines data schemas and type annotations, which are essential for security but do not in themselves introduce risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of data model definitions for an authentication framework with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any dangerous operations or include embedded malicious logic. Its purpose appears to be standard and secure for handling authentication data.",
