  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the details provided and cross-referencing with the code to identify any discrepancies or overlooked issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Data models for auth system.\n- Findings: No malicious code, no obfuscation, well-maintained.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Confidence: 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis report correctly identifies that the code is primarily data schemas with no malicious logic. The use of conditional imports for pydantic compatibility is standard. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Data models for auth system.\n- Findings: No malicious behavior, standard patterns, potential untrusted data flow into models.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Confidence: 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurately notes that untrusted data could flow into models, which is expected in such schemas. No malicious activity or backdoors are evident. The report is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Data models for auth system.\n- Findings: No anomalies, no obfuscation, standard usage.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Confidence: 0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis aligns with the code's purpose. No suspicious patterns or malicious code detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Data models for auth SDK.\n- Findings: No external IO, no malicious behavior, standard validation.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code, which is purely data modeling with no operational logic that could be malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Data models for auth SDK.\n- Findings: No malicious behavior, no external data processing, minimal security risk.\n- Malware Score: 0\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrectly concludes that the code is a schema definition with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n  None of the reports identify any embedded malicious logic, network calls, or obfuscated code. The code is purely declarative, defining data structures for an auth system.\n\n- **Obfuscation & Anomalies:**  \n  No obfuscation, suspicious comments, or dynamic code execution are present. The only noteworthy pattern is the version compatibility handling for pydantic, which is standard.\n\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:**  \n  The code exposes data models that include tokens, secrets, and user info. While these are sensitive, their handling is expected in an auth SDK. The actual security depends on how these models are used elsewhere, but within this code, no vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n- **Scores Justification:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code. The risk scores are low, reflecting the non-operational, schema-focused nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, a risk score of around 0.1 to 0.2 is reasonable, mainly due to the sensitive data fields, but no actual security flaw is identified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThis supply chain report correctly assesses the code as a non-malicious, schema-only set of data models for an authentication system. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks inherent in this code snippet.\n\n**Estimated final scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\nThis code appears safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
