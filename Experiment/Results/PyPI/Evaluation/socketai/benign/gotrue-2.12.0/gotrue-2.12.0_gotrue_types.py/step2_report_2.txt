  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines data models for an auth system, with no external data reading or malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that this is schema/structure code, with no evident malicious intent. The confidence level is high (0.95), and the malware score is 0, which aligns with the findings.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues found; the code appears secure and standard.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing data models, with potential data flow from untrusted sources in real use, but no actual malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The report notes that untrusted data could flow into the models but finds no malicious behavior or backdoors. The malware score remains 0, and the confidence is high (0.95).\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; purely data validation schemas.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a description of data models with no external data processing or suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis confirms that the code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity. The malware score is 0, and confidence is perfect (1.0).\n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Focused on data validation and structure, with no external data handling or malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The report aligns with previous findings, indicating the code is safe, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Data models for an SDK, with no external IO or malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The report confirms the code is purely data schema definitions, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure, with minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the reports find any malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the content.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, primarily because the code is schema definitions, not operational code executing untrusted data or commands.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (consistent across reports)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or dangerous data flows, a risk score of around **0.1** seems appropriate—indicating minimal risk.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a set of data models for an authentication system, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is standard, well-structured, and intended for data validation and schema definition.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal inherent risk in schema code)\n\nThis assessment aligns with all the reports and the nature of the code.",
