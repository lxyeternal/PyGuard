{
  "purpose": "An async API client for user and MFA management, performing operations such as sign-out, user invitation, link generation, user creation, listing, updating, and deletion.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, request body payloads, URL path segments, and query parameters used in HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request methods sending data to external servers; no untrusted data handling within the code itself.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into request bodies, URL paths, and query strings, which are then sent via async HTTP requests to external APIs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code follows standard async API client patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured async API wrapper for user and MFA management. It uses typical request patterns, handles sensitive data via parameters, and does not contain any obfuscated or malicious code. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are present. The security measures rely on proper request handling and external API security, which are assumed to be correctly implemented. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign API client with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. The scores and assessments are justified and accurate.",
