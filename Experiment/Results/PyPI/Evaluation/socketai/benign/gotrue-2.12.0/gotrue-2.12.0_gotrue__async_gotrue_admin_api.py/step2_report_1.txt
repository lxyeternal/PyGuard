  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the logical consistency, potential security issues, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a standard async admin API client managing users and MFA, with data flowing into request bodies and URL parameters.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The code is typical for such clients.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent. The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—API wrapper for user management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs. Inputs are standard parameters.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** Also consistent. No malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** API client for sign-out, invite, link generation, user management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation. Uses standard async requests.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is straightforward and appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** API client for user management, sessions, MFA.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. Uses parameters from callers.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** API client for user/session management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Uses standard async patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (0.9), no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious signs.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe a typical, well-structured async API client for user and MFA management.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All scores are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low (around 0.1-0.2), consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Logic & Reasoning:** The reports are consistent, and their conclusions are justified based on the code's structure and content.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no signs of malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (very low, standard API client code)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, typical for such code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and justified. The code is a standard, legitimate API client with no malicious or security-compromising features.",
