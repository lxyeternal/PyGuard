{
  "purpose": "This code provides an asynchronous API wrapper for admin operations on a user management system, including user creation, deletion, listing, and MFA management.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include function parameters such as email, user ID, attributes, and options. These are mostly passed into request bodies and URL paths.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include request body construction, URL paths for user IDs, and request method calls that send data to external endpoints.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like email, user ID, and attributes flow into request bodies or URL endpoints, which are then sent via HTTP requests to external services.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. It relies on external variables and parameters passed at runtime. No unusual or suspicious code constructs are evident. The only noteworthy aspect is that it handles sensitive data like user attributes and IDs, but these are expected in such API wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an API client class with methods for user management. It securely accepts inputs via function parameters and constructs HTTP requests accordingly. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines. No code injection or unsafe operations are apparent. The design adheres to common practices for server-side API wrappers. Overall, the code appears benign and focused on its legitimate administrative functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client implementation for user management with no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows. The implementation appears safe and intended for legitimate server-side use.",
