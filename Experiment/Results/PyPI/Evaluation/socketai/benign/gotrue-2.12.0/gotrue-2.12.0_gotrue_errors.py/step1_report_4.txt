{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and types for handling various authentication errors in a Python application, including error codes, error classes, and methods for converting errors to dictionaries.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as message strings, status codes, and optional error details. No external data sources are directly accessed in this code.",
  "sinks": "The code mainly constructs error objects and dictionaries for exception handling. There are no sinks that process or output untrusted data directly, such as network operations or file writes.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (error messages, status, codes, details) are used to instantiate error objects, which can be converted to dictionaries for further handling or reporting.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard for defining custom error classes with structured error information. No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically creates various custom error classes for authentication-related issues, including error codes and detailed error information. It uses standard Python exception patterns and type annotations. There are no indications of data leaks, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors. All classes and methods serve typical error handling purposes, with no suspicious logic or external data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of custom error classes for an authentication system, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It focuses on structured error reporting and exception handling without external dependencies or suspicious patterns.",
