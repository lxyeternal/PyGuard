  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and evaluating the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class and type definitions for error handling in an authentication context.\n- No external data processing, network activity, file I/O, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The error codes are static string literals; no secrets or sensitive data are embedded.\n- The to_dict() methods are straightforward serialization routines.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Defines custom exception classes for auth errors.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1, which seems low but reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Malware score:** 0, aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Well-reasoned, accurate.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, standard error classes.\n- **Findings:** No issues, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, structured error handling.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity or anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as previous, error classes with serialization.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same, standard error class definitions.\n- **Findings:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Code presence:** The code matches the descriptions; no discrepancies.\n- **Malware assessment:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk scores:** The low scores (mostly 0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions are made; the analysis is consistent.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n- The overall security posture of this code is negligible risk.\n- The detailed reasoning supports the conclusion that this code is purely for structured error handling, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0.05 (minimal, due to the potential for misuse if integrated into a larger system, but negligible here)\n\n**Summary:** The code is standard, well-structured, and poses no security threat. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
