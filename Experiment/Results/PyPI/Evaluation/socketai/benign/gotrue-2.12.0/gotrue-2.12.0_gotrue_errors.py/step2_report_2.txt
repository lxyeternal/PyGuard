  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a set of custom exception classes and related types for error handling.\n   - The code is static, defining classes, constants, and methods without dynamic or external data processing.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they recognize the code's purpose and confirm its benign nature.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of external data handling, network operations, or side effects.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or near 0), consistent with the benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high, reflecting thorough and accurate assessments.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5):**\n   - The code contains no external data handling, no network activity, and no code execution.\n   - The exception classes are purely for internal error reporting.\n   - Therefore, risk scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware scores:**\n   - All reports correctly identify a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on static analysis.\n   - No suspicious or speculative claims are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature—simple, structured error handling classes.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable adjustments are observed.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of custom exception classes for authentication error handling.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, security risk: near 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to the fact that this code could be part of a larger system; on its own, it's very low risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, with no signs of supply chain or security issues. The reports are accurate and thorough.",
