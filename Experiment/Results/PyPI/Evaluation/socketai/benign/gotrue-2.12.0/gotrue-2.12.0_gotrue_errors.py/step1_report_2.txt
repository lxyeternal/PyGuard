{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and type definitions for handling various authentication errors in a Python application.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for error codes and error messages, and uses class constructors that do not process external input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data transmissions, file writes, or external calls.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident as there are only class definitions and static data.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines error types and exception classes for authentication-related errors, using static string literals and standard class inheritance. No external data input, network communication, or system modification logic is present. The structure is straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of error handling classes for an authentication system. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious data handling, and no malware behavior. Overall, it poses no security risk.",
