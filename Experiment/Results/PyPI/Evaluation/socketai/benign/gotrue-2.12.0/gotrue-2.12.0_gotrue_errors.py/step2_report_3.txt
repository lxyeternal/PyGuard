  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the reported observations against the code, and assessing the reasoning, scores, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines custom exception classes for auth errors, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly notes that the code is straightforward, with no dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1 (minimal, likely due to the nature of exception handling code).\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score is reasonable; the code is purely for structured error handling.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature of the code, with no external data or malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is purely class definitions and constants.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Justification:** The code's simplicity and lack of external data handling justify these scores.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard error handling setup, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code structure; no dynamic execution, no external data, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward and safe.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines error classes and types, with no external data processing or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; no external data or side effects.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Justification:** The code's purpose is purely error structure definition.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing the lack of suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is standard for error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0; this is appropriate. The code contains no malicious payloads or behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All are very low (0.1 or 0), which makes sense given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a minimal, almost negligible security risk due to exception handling code structure)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured set of custom exception classes for an authentication system. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.",
