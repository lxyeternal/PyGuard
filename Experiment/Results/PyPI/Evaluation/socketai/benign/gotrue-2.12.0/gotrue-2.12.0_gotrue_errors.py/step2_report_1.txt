  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, focusing on the key points:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is a set of custom exception classes and error handling structures for authentication errors.\n   - No external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - The code is static, well-structured, and uses standard Python practices.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic or Reasoning**:\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are identified across the reports.\n   - The reports correctly interpret the code as purely defining error classes and serialization methods.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Issues**:\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or near 0), aligning with the analysis.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.95 to 1), indicating strong agreement.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - None of the reports suggest any behavior that would justify a high risk score.\n   - The code is purely for error handling and does not perform any external actions, data manipulation, or security-sensitive operations.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:\n   - All reports agree on a malware score of 0, which is justified.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports are cautious and base their conclusions on static analysis.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature as a non-malicious, purely structural error handling module.\n\n**Overall Assessment**:\n- The code is standard, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The error classes and type annotations are typical for a Python authentication library.\n- No security risks or malware concerns are evident.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (confirmed no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final conclusion**:\nThis supply chain component appears safe, with no indication of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
