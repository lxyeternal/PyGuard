{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes, type aliases, and constants related to authentication error handling within a Python application or library.",
  "sources": "Constants defining error codes, class initializers, and methods that create error objects and serialize them to dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Serialization methods like to_dict() that output error information, class constructors that handle error data.",
  "flows": "Error class instantiations lead to data being stored in class attributes and potentially being serialized for responses or logs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code patterns are present. Usage of type annotations and custom error classes is standard and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes a structured approach to error handling with custom exception classes for various authentication error scenarios. It uses type annotations for clarity and type safety, and provides methods to serialize errors for API responses. No evidence of data leakage, malicious backdoors, or suspicious network behavior is detected. The code appears to be straightforward and intentionally designed for error management without any hidden or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard error handling for a Python authentication module, with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code detected. It does not exhibit signs of malware or supply chain attacks. Overall, the code appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
