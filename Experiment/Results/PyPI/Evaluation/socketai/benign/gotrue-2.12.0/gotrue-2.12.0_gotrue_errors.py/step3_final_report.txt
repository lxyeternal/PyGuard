  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and error codes for authentication error handling and serialization.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, type annotations, static string literals for error codes, and serialization methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of error classes and calling to_dict() methods for serialization; no external data flow or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static, straightforward, and uses standard Python practices.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises purely of class definitions for structured error handling in an auth system, with no dynamic code execution, external data processing, or obfuscation. All error codes are static strings, and serialization methods are simple. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is purely structural, and it does not perform any network, file, or environment manipulations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: near 0) are justified given the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of error classes for authentication error handling, with no malicious or security-risk behavior. The scores of malware and obfuscation are correct at 0, and the overall security risk is negligible. The analysis confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for supply chain use.",
