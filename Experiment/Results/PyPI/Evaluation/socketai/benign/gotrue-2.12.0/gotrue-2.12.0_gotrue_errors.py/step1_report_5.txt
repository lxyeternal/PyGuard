{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and type annotations for authentication error handling.",
  "sources": "Constants for error codes, class constructors, and method implementations within exception classes.",
  "sinks": "None of the sinks involve processing untrusted data or performing security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks; code mainly defines data structures and exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected. All class attributes and methods are standard for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a structured error handling system for authentication, including custom exceptions, error codes, and methods to convert errors to dictionaries. There are no input sources or data flows that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions. No evidence of obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code segments. The design appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom error classes for authentication, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily manages error data structures and exception handling without external data processing or security-sensitive operations.",
