  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code defines structured error classes for auth errors, with no external data handling, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both set to 0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concerns; the code is standard error handling.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static strings, class definitions, and no external data processing.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, aligning with the straightforward nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or security risks.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Error classes with serialization methods, no external data handling, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard error management code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Defines custom errors with structured data, no external data sources or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks or malware.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar structure, no suspicious code or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, matching the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard error handling code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior. The code is purely for structured error handling with no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated parts, no network or file operations, and no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any malicious activity, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations, a low risk score is justified.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a collection of custom exception classes and type definitions for error handling in an authentication context.\n- It uses static strings, type annotations, and serialization methods for reporting.\n- There are no signs of data leaks, malicious payloads, backdoors, or supply chain compromises.\n- The overall design is standard, clean, and security-conscious.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a minimal, conservative baseline for error handling code, but practically negligible)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of error classes for an authentication system, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a very low risk score.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the analysis is consistent and justified.",
