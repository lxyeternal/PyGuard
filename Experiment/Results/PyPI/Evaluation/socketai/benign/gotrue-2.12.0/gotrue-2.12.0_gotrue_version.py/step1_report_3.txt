The comment hints at integration with release tools but does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious code, obfuscated patterns, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to specify package version information with a standard comment for versioning automation. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
