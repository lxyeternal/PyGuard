  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze their conclusions and scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No external inputs, data flows, or suspicious code are identified.\n- Comments referencing release tools or placeholders are standard in automated release workflows.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activity are detected.\n\n**Confirming code presence:**\n- The original code snippet is exactly: `__version__ = \"2.12.0\"` with an inline comment.\n- All reports correctly identify this as a simple version assignment.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n- They correctly dismiss any malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- The `malware` score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The `obfuscated` score is 0, also appropriate.\n- The `securityRisk` score is 0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n- The `confidence` is 1 in all reports, reflecting certainty.\n\n**Justification for risk scores:**\n- Since the code is a simple static assignment with no external dependencies, inputs, or suspicious patterns, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The comments referencing release tools or placeholders do not introduce security concerns; they are standard practices.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or points of challenge:**\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are made; all assessments are conservative and accurate.\n- No assumptions are unjustified; the analysis correctly interprets the code's intent.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Final note:** The assessments are thorough and accurate. The code is a standard version string assignment, with no security concerns.",
