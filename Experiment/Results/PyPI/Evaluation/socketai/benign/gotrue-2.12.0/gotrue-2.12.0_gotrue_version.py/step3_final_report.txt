  "purpose": "Assigns the version string for the package, indicating its release version.",
  "sources": "The code reads a static string assigned to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "Direct assignment from a static string to __version__, no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a placeholder comment for release automation, which is standard; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a version string with an inline comment referencing release tools. No external inputs, data flows, or executable code are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious intent. All assessments and scores are accurate and do not require adjustment.",
