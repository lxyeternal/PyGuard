  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a static version string to the `__version__` variable. There are no signs of code execution, external data handling, or any malicious payloads. The comments referencing release tools are standard in package versioning and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The reports do not identify any errors or flaws in the code. The code is minimal, conventional, and serves a common purpose in Python packages.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code being clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security issues.\n\n4. **Risk Score Justification:**  \n   Since the code is purely a static assignment with no external dependencies, inputs, or executable code, the overall security risk should remain at 0. There is no reason to increase this score.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly assume that the code is benign. The comments referencing version management are standard and do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code snippet is a typical version declaration in Python packages with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
