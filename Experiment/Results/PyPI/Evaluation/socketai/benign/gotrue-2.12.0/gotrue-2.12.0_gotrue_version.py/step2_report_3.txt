  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Issue presence**: The code is a straightforward assignment of a static string to `__version__`. No malicious code, data flows, or external inputs.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None. The reasoning is accurate.\n   - **Scores**: All zeroes for malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: Benign, no issues.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same as above; just assigning a version string.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**: Appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: Benign.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same pattern, no malicious activity.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**: Appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: Benign.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same pattern; placeholder comment suggests use with automation tools but no malicious intent.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**: Appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: Benign.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same as above; standard version assignment.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**: Appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: Benign.\n\n**Overall assessment**:\n- All reports describe a simple, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The comments referencing release automation are standard and not suspicious.\n\n**Final recommendation**:\n- The malware score should remain at 0 for all reports.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk score should be 0, given the benign nature.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code snippet is a typical, harmless version declaration used in Python packages, with no security concerns.",
