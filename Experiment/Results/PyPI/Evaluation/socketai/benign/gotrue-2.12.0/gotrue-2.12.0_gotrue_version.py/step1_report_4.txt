  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only assigns a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment with a placeholder '{x-release-please-version}', which suggests potential templating or automated release process, but no malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a version string to the __version__ variable. The comment indicates a placeholder used in automated release workflows. No code execution, data processing, or external interactions are present. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or unusual code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign version declaration with a placeholder comment commonly used in automated release processes. No malicious behavior detected.",
