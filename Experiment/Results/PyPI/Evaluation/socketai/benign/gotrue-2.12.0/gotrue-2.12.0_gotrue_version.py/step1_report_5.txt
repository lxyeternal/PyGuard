  "purpose": "Define the package version string for the Python module",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded string assigned to __version__",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to untrusted sources; no output or external data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns a static value",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating versioning management, but no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to the __version__ variable, which is a common practice in Python packages. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious code behavior. The comment suggests integration with a version management system, but this is standard practice. Overall, the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version assignment with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could be considered malicious or insecure.",
