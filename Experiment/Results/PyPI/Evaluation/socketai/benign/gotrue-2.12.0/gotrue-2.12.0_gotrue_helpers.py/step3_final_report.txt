  "purpose": "Utility functions for JWT handling, response parsing, error management, and security features like PKCE generation and validation.",
  "sources": "Reading headers (e.g., API version), input tokens (JWT), response data, and error objects.",
  "sinks": "Decoding JWTs, validating tokens, parsing response data, raising errors, and cryptographic operations.",
  "flows": "Input tokens and response data are validated and decoded; errors are processed and raised; cryptographic functions generate/verifier PKCE challenges.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Proper padding and validation are used.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic and data parsing tasks with proper validation, error handling, and security practices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The functions are straightforward, and the scoring reflects a low risk profile. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscation to 0, and the risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the context of handling untrusted data, but no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, well-structured utility module for authentication workflows, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The current scores are justified and appropriate.",
