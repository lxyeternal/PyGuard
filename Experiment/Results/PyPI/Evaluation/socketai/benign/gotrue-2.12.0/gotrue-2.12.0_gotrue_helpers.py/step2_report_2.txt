  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility module for JWT handling, API response parsing, error handling, and security features like PKCE verification.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, standard cryptographic practices, proper padding for base64, secure PKCE generation, and safe error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code review. No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on utility functions for JWT, responses, and security operations.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious code, no obfuscation, standard cryptographic methods, proper error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code, no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for JWT, API responses, error parsing, URL validation.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded credentials, no malicious logic, standard practices, error handling seems appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears safe and well-structured.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for JWT, response parsing, PKCE, error handling.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, standard cryptographic operations, proper validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard utility functions for JWT, response parsing, PKCE, error handling.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, safe cryptographic practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Presence & Functionality:** All reports confirm that the code performs standard, well-understood functions related to JWT validation, response parsing, error handling, and PKCE generation.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The code uses standard cryptographic and validation techniques.\n- **Obfuscation & Malware:** All reports agree on the absence of obfuscation and malware.\n- **Security Risks:** The assigned risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate given the nature of the code—utility functions with no known vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- **Scores Justification:** The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. Since the code is a utility module with no malicious activity, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9), consistent with the thorough analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, standard utility functions with minimal security risk)\n\nThis code appears to be a well-structured, secure utility module for authentication workflows, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.",
