{
  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for handling JWT tokens, API response parsing, error handling, and security-related operations such as generating PKCE verifiers and decoding JWTs.",
  "sources": "Input data from API responses, error objects, and external URL or token strings.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data used in decoding, validation, or constructing objects; data returned from functions and used in error handling.",
  "flows": "Input data (API responses, tokens) flows through validation and parsing functions; errors and exceptions are caught and processed; data is decoded or validated, and results are returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials or backdoors. Functions like generate_pkce_verifier and decode_jwt perform security-sensitive operations but follow standard practices. No malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple utility functions for JWT handling, error parsing, API response parsing, and security measures such as generating PKCE verifiers and validating JWTs. The functions use standard libraries and do not include any obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious constructs. Error handling covers typical HTTP status errors and specific error messages. The use of base64url decoding, regex for validation, and cryptographic hashing follows secure practices. No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors are identified. The code appears to be well-structured, with no signs of hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions related to authentication and API response handling. No malicious intent or harmful behavior is evident. It follows secure coding practices and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code patterns.",
