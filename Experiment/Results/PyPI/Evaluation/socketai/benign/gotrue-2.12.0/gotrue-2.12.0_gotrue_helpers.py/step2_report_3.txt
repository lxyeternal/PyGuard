  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is utility functions for JWT handling, response parsing, error handling, and security features like PKCE. No suspicious or malicious activity is observed. Uses padding for base64, secure random for PKCE, and standard error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. These seem reasonable given the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard security practices are employed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the functions are standard, with no malicious code or obfuscation. Focused on token validation, decoding, and error handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Utility functions for authentication, no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard JWT, response, and error handling functions. No suspicious patterns or malicious code. The functions follow best practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code, no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar assessment; functions for JWT validation, response parsing, PKCE, error handling. No malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard, secure utility functions.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; functions for JWT handling, response parsing, PKCE, error management. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purpose-built utility code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Summary:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** No actual issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code snippets.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports correctly identify no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** The assigned risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting a low but non-zero baseline risk typical for utility code that handles untrusted data.\n- **Assumptions & Claims:** The reports do not rely on unfounded assumptions; they correctly interpret the code's purpose and behavior.\n- **Consistency:** The scores are consistent across reports and justified by the analysis.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — appropriate for utility functions handling untrusted data but with no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n**Additional note:** The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of JWT and response handling functions, with proper security practices. No hidden malicious intent or backdoors are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code is safe, well-designed, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.",
