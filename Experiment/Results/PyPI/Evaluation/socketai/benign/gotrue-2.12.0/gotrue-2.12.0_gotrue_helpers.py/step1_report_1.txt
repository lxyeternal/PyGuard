  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for handling JWTs, API responses, error handling, and security features like PKCE verification.",
  "sources": "Input data from HTTP responses, token strings, configuration constants, and environment data.",
  "sinks": "Decoding and parsing functions that process tokens, responses, and inputs; no direct data leakage or system modification points identified.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., tokens, response headers) are validated and decoded; no dangerous flow patterns detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. The code uses standard security practices like padding for base64, PKCE generation, and JWT validation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard cryptographic and data parsing tasks. Functions for validating JWT structure and content do not process untrusted data beyond necessary decoding. Error handling is consistent and does not reveal sensitive information. Base64 handling includes padding to prevent errors. PKCE verifier generation uses secure random choice within a valid character set. Response parsing and error interpretation follow typical patterns without evident malicious intent. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured utility module for authentication and response processing with no signs of malicious behavior. It employs standard security practices and does not contain hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or unsafe operations.",
