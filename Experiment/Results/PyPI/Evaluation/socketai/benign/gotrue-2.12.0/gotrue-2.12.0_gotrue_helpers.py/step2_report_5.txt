  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code's content, and assess the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a utility module for handling JWTs, API responses, error handling, and security features like PKCE. It notes no suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code performs standard cryptographic and data parsing tasks, with padding for base64, secure PKCE generation, and error handling. No signs of malicious activity are evident.\n\n- **Score justification:** The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. The security risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable given the utility nature but acknowledging potential misuses if inputs are malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, no obfuscation, and no malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** Functions for JWT handling, error parsing, and response validation follow typical patterns. No suspicious network activity or backdoors.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware is 0; the code is standard. Security risk 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on JWT validation, response parsing, error handling, and cryptographic operations. Notes no malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions are standard, with proper validation, padding, and exception handling. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score remains 0. Security risk score is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code handles JWTs, responses, PKCE, and errors securely, with no malicious patterns.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's operations are typical for an auth utility module, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is consistent; security risk 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing standard JWT and response handling, no suspicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code performs expected cryptographic and validation tasks without malicious intent.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0; security risk 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** No, all reports agree the code is standard, with no backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's clarity.\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated at 0.2, perhaps reflecting that improper use or malicious inputs could cause issues, but the code itself does not pose a direct threat.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The functions perform validation and decoding securely, with no assumptions that lead to false positives.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain 0.0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with code clarity.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is acceptable, reflecting the potential for misuse if inputs are malicious, but not inherent vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a well-structured utility module for JWT and API response handling, employing standard cryptographic and validation practices. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese reflect the code's benign nature and standard security practices.",
