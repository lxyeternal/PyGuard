  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is primarily utility functions for JWT handling, response parsing, error handling, and security features like PKCE. No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** The functions perform standard, well-understood cryptographic and parsing tasks. Error handling is consistent, and no malicious code or backdoors are evident. The code adheres to best practices (padding, secure random, regex validation).\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (correct)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n  - Risk: 0.2 (low, given it's utility code)  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the utility functions for JWT, response parsing, error handling, and security measures. No malicious intent observed.\n\n- **Assessment:** Functions follow standard practices, no obfuscation, no backdoors, no suspicious network activity. Error handling is robust, and cryptographic operations are standard.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for JWT, responses, error parsing, cryptographic operations, and URL/JWT validation. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code performs typical SDK tasks securely. No suspicious data exfiltration, obfuscation, or malicious logic. Error handling is standard, and cryptography follows best practices.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2  \n\n**Verdict:** Valid scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions for JWT, response parsing, error handling, with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent. No obfuscation or backdoors. Error handling and cryptography are standard.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for JWT, response parsing, PKCE, error handling, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. The code is straightforward and secure.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0.2  \n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Risk scores:** Given these are utility functions, a low risk score (~0.2) is appropriate, reflecting minimal security risk outside of the inherent importance of correct implementation.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed; all reports correctly assess the code as benign, well-structured, and secure.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, as utility code, but still critical to implement correctly)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, secure utility module for authentication processes, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
