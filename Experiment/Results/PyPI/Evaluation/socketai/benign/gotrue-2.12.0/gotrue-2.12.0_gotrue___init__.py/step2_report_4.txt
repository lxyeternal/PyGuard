  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple import/setup module, with no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no handling of untrusted data, and no suspicious patterns.\n- The use of \"type: ignore\" comments is standard in some codebases to suppress static analysis warnings, not an indication of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or external data sources are present.\n- The code appears to be a typical package __init__.py or module setup script.\n\n**Assessment of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as benign import statements organizing internal components.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — high.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as above, consistent.\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion, straightforward import setup.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent.\n- No suspicious activity detected.\n- **Malware:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; I agree with a malware score of **0.0**.\n- **Obfuscated:** None of the reports suggest obfuscation; I concur with **0.0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely import statements with no dynamic or sensitive operations, the risk score should be **0.0**.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- There are no assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent here; the code is standard package setup.\n- The \"type: ignore\" comments are common in type-annotated Python codebases and do not indicate malicious obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n| Score Type      | Suggested Value |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware         | 0.0             |\n| Obfuscated      | 0.0             |\n| Security Risk   | 0.0             |\n\nThis aligns with the observed code and the detailed analysis.\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
