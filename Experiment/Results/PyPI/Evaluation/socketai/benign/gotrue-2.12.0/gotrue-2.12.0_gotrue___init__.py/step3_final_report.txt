{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing internal components such as API clients, storage backends, types, and version info for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, including async and sync API classes, storage classes, types, and version information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process input or output data, nor does it perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only imports modules; there are no data flows or execution paths involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '# type: ignore' comments is standard for static analysis suppression; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements organizing internal modules for a Python package. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or data handling. The use of 'type: ignore' is typical and not suspicious. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of any suspicious patterns or external data interactions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
