{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an import and module initialization script for a Python package, organizing asynchronous and synchronous APIs and storage modules related to authentication and data management.",
  "sources": "Import statements from various internal modules (_async, _sync, types, version). These modules are sources of data, code logic, and configuration details.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are evident; the code mainly imports modules and does not perform data processing or external communications.",
  "flows": "The code's flow is limited to importing modules; there are no data flows or execution paths involving external data or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only import statements and no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observable.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward import module, organizing internal components for asynchronous and synchronous APIs, storage, and type definitions. It includes ignore comments for type checking and linting, indicating standard practice rather than obfuscation or malicious intent. No external data processing, network activity, or code execution occurs here. There are no anomalies, suspicious constructs, or signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module import setup for a larger package. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It simply organizes and imports internal components, suggesting safe and standard practice.",
