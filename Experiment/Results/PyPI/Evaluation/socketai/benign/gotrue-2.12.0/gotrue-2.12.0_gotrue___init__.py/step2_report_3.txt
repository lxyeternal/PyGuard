  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of import statements, importing internal modules, types, and version info.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, data processing, or external input handling is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The use of \"type: ignore\" comments is a common practice to suppress static analysis warnings, not an indication of malicious intent.\n- The structure resembles a typical `__init__.py` or module setup script for a Python package.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward import setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Logical accuracy:**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malware or security risks.\n\n- **Potential overestimation:**  \n  The reports assign a malware score of 0.0, which aligns with the analysis. The risk scores are all 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **Obfuscation and malware scores:**  \n  All reports correctly identify no obfuscation or malware. The \"obfuscated\" score is 0, and \"malware\" is 0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Score suggestions:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0.0, which is justified. No malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports give a risk score of 0 or 0.1, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **Confidence levels:**  \n  Confidence is 1.0 or close, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Potential assumptions:**  \n  The reports assume that import statements alone are harmless, which is correct. No assumptions about hidden malicious code are made, and that is appropriate.\n\n- **Significance of \"type: ignore\":**  \n  The use of \"type: ignore\" comments is standard in some projects to suppress static analysis errors; it does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0.0** (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. The code is a benign module import setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence presented.",
