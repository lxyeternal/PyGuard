  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup configuration script for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports 'setuptools' and uses static parameters in 'setuptools.setup()'.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data beyond package configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script is static and only defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard setup script that imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with fixed parameters. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscated elements. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0. The code aligns with common open-source packaging practices and poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
