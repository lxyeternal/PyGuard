  "purpose": "Utility module for creating a Magnum container infrastructure API client with configurable options via environment variables and parameters.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'OS_CONTAINER_INFRA_API_VERSION', instance object attributes (_api_version, session, _region_name, _interface, _insecure, _cacert).",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable and instance attribute values flow into client instantiation and CLI argument defaults.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard patterns and no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging and utility modules, defines constants for API versions, and provides functions to instantiate a client and add CLI options. It relies on environment variables and instance parameters, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious code. The logic is simple and standard for SDK configuration. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The environment variable usage is typical for configuration, and the code does not perform any network activity or data exfiltration. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, configuration nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for API client setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The low security risk and malware scores are justified and appropriate.",
