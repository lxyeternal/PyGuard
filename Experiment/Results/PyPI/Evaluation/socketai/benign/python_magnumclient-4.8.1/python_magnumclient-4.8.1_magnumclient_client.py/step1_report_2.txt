  "purpose": "Factory function to create a new container service client for the Magnum OpenStack service.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the Client() function, specifically the 'version' argument and '**kwargs'.",
  "sinks": "None observed; the code does not process or output untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "Input argument 'version' is checked; if valid, it proceeds to create and return a client object using the provided kwargs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with proper validation of the 'version' parameter. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific client module and defines a factory function that enforces API version '1'. It raises an exception if an unsupported version is requested. It then calls the client constructor with provided arguments. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The logic is simple and adheres to expected patterns for client factory functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and performs standard client creation with version validation. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are present.",
