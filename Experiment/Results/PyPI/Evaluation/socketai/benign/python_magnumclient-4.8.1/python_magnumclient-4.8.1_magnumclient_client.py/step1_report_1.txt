  "purpose": "Create a factory function to instantiate a Magnum container service client for API version 1.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the Client() function, specifically the 'version' argument and any additional kwargs.",
  "sinks": "The return of client.Client(**kwargs), which initializes a client instance with provided parameters.",
  "flows": "The function checks the 'version' input, then passes kwargs directly to client.Client().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behavior. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a client class from magnumclient.v1, defines a factory function that restricts API version to '1', raising an error otherwise, and returns a client instance with provided kwargs. It is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The function limits the API version, which is a normal compatibility check. No external data sources, sinks, or flows indicating malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign factory function for creating a container service client. It performs basic input validation and instantiates the client with given parameters, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
