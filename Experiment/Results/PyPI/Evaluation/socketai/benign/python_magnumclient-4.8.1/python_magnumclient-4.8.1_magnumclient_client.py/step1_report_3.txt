  "purpose": "Factory function to create a new container service client for the Magnum API v1.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (version, **kwargs), imported client module",
  "sinks": "client.Client(**kwargs) potentially passing untrusted data to client constructor",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> function logic -> client.Client constructor",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code performs straightforward validation and instantiation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a factory function 'Client' that only allows version '1'. It validates the input version and raises an error if another version is specified. The function then creates and returns a client object from 'magnumclient.v1.client'. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as hidden network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of **kwargs may allow for flexible parameter passing, but nothing malicious is evident. The code appears to be a simple wrapper with input validation, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward factory function for creating a Magnum v1 client, with input validation and no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
