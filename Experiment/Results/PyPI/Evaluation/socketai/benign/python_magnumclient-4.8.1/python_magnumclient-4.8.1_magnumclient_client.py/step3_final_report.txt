  "purpose": "Factory function to create a new magnum client instance with version validation.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'kwargs' passed directly to client.Client()",
  "sinks": "client.Client(**kwargs) potentially receiving untrusted data",
  "flows": "Function checks 'version' then passes 'kwargs' to client.Client()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward validation and delegation",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple factory that enforces version '1' and delegates client creation to an external library, passing all additional arguments directly. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present. The passing of 'kwargs' is standard but could be risky if the client implementation is compromised, though this is outside this code's scope. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The validation is minimal but appropriate for this context. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard factory function for creating a client object with simple version validation. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is detected. The minimal security risk score reflects the standard delegation pattern. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for supply chain use.",
