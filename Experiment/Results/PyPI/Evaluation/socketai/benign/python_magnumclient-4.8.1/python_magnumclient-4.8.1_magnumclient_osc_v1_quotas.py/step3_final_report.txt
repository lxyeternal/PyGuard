  "purpose": "CLI commands for managing resource quotas via API interactions, allowing creation, deletion, viewing, updating, and listing quotas based on user input.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments provided by the user, API calls to mag_client.quotas methods for create, delete, get, update, and list operations.",
  "sinks": "Console output for success or error messages; API interactions involve network communication but are standard for such CLI tools.",
  "flows": "User inputs parsed into function parameters, which are then used to invoke API methods; results are printed to the console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Error handling is basic but typical.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward CLI interface for quota management, relying on external API calls. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. Exception handling is minimal, primarily printing errors. The logic is clear and standard for such administrative tools. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code flows are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, considering external API interactions pose minimal inherent risk. Overall, the code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign CLI utility for quota management with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal and primarily related to external API configuration, outside the scope of this review. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
