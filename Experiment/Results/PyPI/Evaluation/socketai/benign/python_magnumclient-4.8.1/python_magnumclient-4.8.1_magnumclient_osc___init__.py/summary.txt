  "conclusion": "The dependency contains some code with potential malicious behavior, notably in reports 2 and 4, which feature eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, and network activity. Benign reports lack these indicators. The overall malware risk is moderate to high, with an average score around 0.65, and obfuscation is present mainly in report 2. The security risk score reflects these findings. No false positives are evident; the scoring is appropriate given the described features."
