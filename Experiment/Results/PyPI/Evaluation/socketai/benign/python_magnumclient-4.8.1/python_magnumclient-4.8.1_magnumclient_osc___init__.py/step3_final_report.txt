  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on static code features.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network connections, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communication, environment variable access, code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or environment variables flow into eval/exec or network functions, leading to potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec on untrusted data, hardcoded credentials or API keys, obfuscation indicators, suspicious network activity, use of environment variables for sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, and network activity in some reports, indicating potential malicious intent. Benign reports lack these features. Obfuscation is only indicated in report 2. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with these features. High malware scores correspond to eval/exec, secrets, and network activity; obfuscation scores align with code complexity or obfuscation indicators. Overall, the assessments are justified and coherent.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains some code with potential malicious behavior, notably in reports 2 and 4, which feature eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, and network activity. Benign reports lack these indicators. The overall malware risk is moderate to high, with an average score around 0.65, and obfuscation is present mainly in report 2. The security risk score reflects these findings. No false positives are evident; the scoring is appropriate given the described features.",
