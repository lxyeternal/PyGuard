{
  "purpose": "This code provides exception aliasing and response normalization for compatibility in an API client library.",
  "sources": "Reads response attributes such as 'status', 'headers', 'status_code', 'text', and 'json'; imports exception classes.",
  "sinks": "Modifies response object attributes for compatibility; uses exception classes for error handling.",
  "flows": "Response object attributes are checked and modified to standardize error handling; exceptions are aliased for backward compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from exceptions import *' can obscure class origins but is not malicious; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code normalizes response objects for different HTTP response formats and creates exception aliases for backward compatibility. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution. The modifications are standard practices for handling diverse response types. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The wildcard import is a minor concern but not malicious. The overall behavior is benign and intended for error handling and compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for exception handling and response normalization, with no malicious or suspicious activity. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 is appropriate due to response attribute modifications, which are benign. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and benign intent.",
