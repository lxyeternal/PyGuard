{
  "purpose": "This code defines exception handling and response parsing functions for a client interacting with the Magnum API, mainly for error management and backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads static imported exceptions, response object attributes, and optional message/traceback parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies response object attributes such as status_code, headers, text, and json return values.",
  "flows": "Input data from response objects or parameters influence the error object returned by from_response(). No external or untrusted input sources directly influence control flow or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code only manages error handling and response adaptation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports exception classes, creates alias for compatibility, and defines a function to generate exception instances based on HTTP response objects. It manipulates response attributes such as status_code, headers, text, and json method, primarily to normalize different response formats. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The focus is on error handling and backward compatibility, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error handling utility for API responses with no malicious or security-compromising behavior. It only modifies response object attributes for compatibility and error reporting purposes.",
