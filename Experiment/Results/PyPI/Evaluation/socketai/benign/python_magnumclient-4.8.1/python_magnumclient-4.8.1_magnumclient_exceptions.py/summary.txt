  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for exception handling and response normalization, with no malicious or suspicious activity. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 is appropriate due to response attribute modifications, which are benign. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and benign intent."
