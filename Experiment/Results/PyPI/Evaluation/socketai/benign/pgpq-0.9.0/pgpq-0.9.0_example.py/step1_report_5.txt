{
  "purpose": "The script downloads a parquet dataset, processes it with Arrow, and bulk loads it into a PostgreSQL database.",
  "sources": "Reads data from an external URL via requests.get() and reads dataset from local temporary files created with mkdtemp().",
  "sinks": "Writes data into a PostgreSQL database using COPY command via psycopg; also writes data to a temporary file.",
  "flows": "External data is fetched from the URL and stored in temporary files; dataset is loaded from local files; data is encoded and sent via PostgreSQL copy command to the database.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior; use of external requests and database interaction are typical. No obfuscated code or hidden actions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code securely downloads a dataset over HTTPS, processes it with established libraries, and loads it into a database. It uses temporary files and safe context managers. No malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activities are evident. The only external connection is to a known public URL and a local PostgreSQL instance. The commented-out insert statement suggests a typical data pipeline. No anomalies or signs of malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs legitimate data download, processing, and loading tasks with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It appears to be a benign data pipeline script.",
