  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a static code generator that uses predefined string templates and static lists to produce code snippets for Python classes, Rust structs, and Postgres types.\n- The code only performs string formatting and printing, with no external input, dynamic code execution, or data handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The purpose appears to be for scaffolding, documentation, or automating code generation for bindings or data type wrappers.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. The code is static, safe, and straightforward. No vulnerabilities or malicious activity are evident.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as a benign template generator with no security concerns.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis. No changes seem necessary.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  Since all reports give a score of 0 for malware and security risk, and the code is static and benign, no justification exists for higher scores.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious actions, and the reports agree. Malware score remains at 0.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  The reports do not rely on assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as static and safe.\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, static code generation utility with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Given the nature of the code and the reports, I agree with the current scores. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
