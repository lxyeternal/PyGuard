  "purpose": "Generate Python class and Rust struct templates for encoder builders and PostgreSQL types, with code snippets for code generation.",
  "sources": "String templates for class and struct definitions, lists of encoder types and PostgreSQL types.",
  "sinks": "None of the templates or lists directly process untrusted input; code primarily outputs formatted code strings.",
  "flows": "N/A: No runtime data flow, just code generation templates and static lists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Code purely defines templates and static lists for code generation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines string templates for generating class and struct definitions in Python and Rust, respectively, using lists of encoder types and PostgreSQL types. It outputs code snippets based on these static lists. No dynamic input, user data, or untrusted sources are involved. No execution of external code, network operations, or environment variable usage is present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code's intent appears to be for code generation, documentation, or library scaffolding, with no apparent security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely contains static templates and lists intended for generating code snippets. There is no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risk detected. It appears to be safe and purposefully designed for code scaffolding.",
