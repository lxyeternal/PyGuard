{
  "purpose": "Generate Python and Rust code templates for various encoder builders and Postgres types, primarily for use in a binding or extension module.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from predefined string templates and list iterations; no external input or data is read from outside sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform data output operations.",
  "flows": "The code iterates over predefined lists to produce formatted code snippets; there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and static; it does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual logic. It generates code templates using simple string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The script defines string templates for Python and Rust code, then iterates over predefined lists of encoder types and PostgreSQL types to print formatted code snippets. It is a static code generator, with no dynamic or external input processing. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The code serves as a code generation utility for defining bindings or data type wrappers. There are no security vulnerabilities such as injection, credential leaks, or malicious payloads.\n\nOverall, this appears to be a benign code template generator with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static code template generator used for defining classes and structs in Python and Rust. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The structure is simple, and the code's purpose is to facilitate code generation for data encoders and PostgreSQL types without any harmful intent.",
