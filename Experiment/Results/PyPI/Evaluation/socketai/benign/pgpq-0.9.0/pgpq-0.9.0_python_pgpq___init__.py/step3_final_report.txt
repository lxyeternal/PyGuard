{
  "purpose": "Module that re-exports the class ArrowToPostgresBinaryEncoder from an internal package for external use.",
  "sources": "Import from pgpq._pgpq, which is an internal module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "Import from internal module to module export; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an internal module and exposes it via __all__, serving as a simple interface. There are no data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution. The import path suggests reliance on internal implementation, but this alone is not suspicious. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The minimal nature indicates a benign module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module interface with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect no malware (0), no obfuscation (0), and a very low security risk (0.0 to 0.1). The reports are consistent with this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
