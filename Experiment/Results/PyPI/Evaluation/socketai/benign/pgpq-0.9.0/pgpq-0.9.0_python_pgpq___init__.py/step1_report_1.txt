{
  "purpose": "Export the ArrowToPostgresBinaryEncoder class from the pgpq._pgpq module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing a class from an internal module; no input or data reading happening within this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs an import and exports the class name.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a future import statement, an import of a specific class from an internal module, and an __all__ declaration to specify exports. There are no data processing, external communication, or executable logic that could be malicious. The presence of a future import is standard practice for compatibility; the import statement appears typical. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module interface setup with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It mainly serves to re-export a class for external use, with no signs of malicious intent or security concerns.",
