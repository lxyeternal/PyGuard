{
  "purpose": "Expose the ArrowToPostgresBinaryEncoder class for external use, likely for encoding data to Postgres binary format.",
  "sources": "Import statement from pgpq._pgpq module to access the class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this code snippet; no processing of untrusted data occurs.",
  "flows": "The code only imports a class and exports it; no data flow operations are shown.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation techniques observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class from a presumably internal module and makes it available for external modules via __all__. There is no data processing, user input, or network activity. The imported class's implementation is not visible here, so potential malicious behavior would depend on its internal code. However, based solely on this snippet, there are no suspicious behaviors or indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module that re-exports a class from an internal package. It does not contain any malicious code or security issues in its current form. The risk is minimal, and the code appears benign.",
