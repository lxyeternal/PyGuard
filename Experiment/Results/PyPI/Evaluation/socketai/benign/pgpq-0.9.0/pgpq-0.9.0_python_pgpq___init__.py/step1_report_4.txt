  "purpose": "Define and export the ArrowToPostgresBinaryEncoder class from the pgpq._pgpq module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing ArrowToPostgresBinaryEncoder from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow present; only an import and export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, uses __future__ for compatibility, and defines __all__ for exports. There is no input handling, no data processing, no external network activity, and no suspicious code patterns. The imported module could contain malicious code, but this cannot be determined from this snippet alone. The code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard, and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks on its own. It merely manages module exports. No anomalies or malware indications are present in this fragment.",
