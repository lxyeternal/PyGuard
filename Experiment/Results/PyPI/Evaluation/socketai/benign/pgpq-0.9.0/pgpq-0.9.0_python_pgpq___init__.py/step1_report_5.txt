{
  "purpose": "Module exports the ArrowToPostgresBinaryEncoder class for encoding data to Postgres binary format.",
  "sources": "Import statement from pgpq._pgpq which likely loads a class or function from an internal module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only performs a module import and an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a class from an internal module and setting __all__ for exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities. It appears to be a standard module export pattern. The import path indicates reliance on an internal package component, but this alone is not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module defining an export for a class, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
