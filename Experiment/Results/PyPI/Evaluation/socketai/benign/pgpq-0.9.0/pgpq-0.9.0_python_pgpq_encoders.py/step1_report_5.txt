{
  "purpose": "The code defines an import statement for various encoder builder classes from the 'pgpq._pgpq' module and exports them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing classes from 'pgpq._pgpq' module",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code only imports and exports class names",
  "flows": "No data flows; just module imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a series of encoder builder classes from a presumably internal or external module and then exposes them via __all__. There is no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or data processing present. The module appears to serve as an aggregation or re-export of specific classes for easier import elsewhere. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage are evident. The structure is straightforward and typical for module organization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and export pattern with no suspicious or malicious activity detected. It appears to be a legitimate component of a larger library or application.",
