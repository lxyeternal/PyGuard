{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports various encoder builder classes from the internal 'pgpq._pgpq' package and re-exports them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions imported from 'pgpq._pgpq'. No untrusted input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or execution effects, as the code only performs static imports and exports class names.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to static import of classes from 'pgpq._pgpq' and their inclusion in __all__, with no runtime data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports a set of encoder builder classes from an internal package and declares them for export. It contains no data processing, user input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The structure is standard for Python modules exposing internal classes. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code's benign nature is supported by the absence of any runtime or external interactions, and the reliance on internal package modules. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for exposing classes from an internal package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current assessments and scores are appropriate and justified.",
