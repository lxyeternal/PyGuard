{
  "purpose": "The code is used to import specific encoder builder classes from the 'pgpq._pgpq' module and to define the exported symbols for a Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pgpq._pgpq' module, and the __all__ variable defining public API.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data handling, network operations, file I/O, or other sensitive sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected. The code appears to be straightforward module interface definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple encoder builder classes from a presumably internal or external module and explicitly exports these classes via __all__. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution present. The code is typical for Python packages defining their API. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. The module appears to be purely for organizing and exposing classes related to encoding functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and export declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It functions solely as a package interface setup.",
