{
  "purpose": "This code defines imports and export of encoder builder classes from the 'pgpq._pgpq' module for use in data encoding processes.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing classes from 'pgpq._pgpq', and the '__all__' list defining exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted inputs; the code only imports classes and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard module setup with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports multiple encoder builder classes from a specific internal module and then declares them for public use via '__all__'. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or external calls that could be exploited or indicate malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious code structures are present. It functions solely as a module import and export definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import/export pattern with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It serves to re-export classes for external use and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements.",
