  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward import and export statements, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.\n- The purpose across all reports is consistent: re-exporting encoder builder classes from the 'pgpq._pgpq' module.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 and report no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Assessment of individual reports:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - Confirms the code is a simple module interface with no malicious intent.  \n   - Score: malware 0, security risk 0.  \n   - Justification: Correct; no issues.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - Same conclusion: standard import/export pattern, no suspicious activity.  \n   - Score: malware 0, security risk 0.  \n   - Justification: Accurate.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - Similar analysis, emphasizing the lack of data processing or malicious behavior.  \n   - Score: malware 0, security risk 0.  \n   - Justification: Valid.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - Reiterates the straightforward nature, no signs of malicious activity.  \n   - Score: malware 0, security risk 0.  \n   - Justification: Appropriate.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - Same as above, confirming no anomalies or malicious intent.  \n   - Score: malware 0, security risk 0.  \n   - Justification: Correct.\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a benign, standard module interface pattern.\n- No suspicious code, malware, or obfuscation is present.\n- The malware score should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly at 0.\n- The security risk score is correctly at 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- The current scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis code appears to be a standard, benign module for API exposure within a Python package.",
