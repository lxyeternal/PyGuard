{
  "purpose": "This module imports and re-exports various encoder builder classes from the 'pgpq._pgpq' package for use in data encoding tasks.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes from the 'pgpq._pgpq' module, which is likely an internal submodule of the 'pgpq' package.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes from a package and re-exports them; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward import and export setup with no unusual or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific encoder builder classes from an internal module of the 'pgpq' package and then defines '__all__' for re-exporting these classes. There are no inputs, outputs, or processing logic. The structure is typical for a package module intended to expose selected classes. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import/export module with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It simply re-exports classes for external use.",
