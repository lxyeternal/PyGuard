{
  "purpose": "This code exports specific classes related to data encoding builders from the 'pgpq._pgpq' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from pgpq._pgpq import (...)', which reads the internal module and its classes; __all__ assignment to specify exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted input or perform data processing that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Import statement flows into the __all__ assignment, defining what symbols are publicly exposed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The code primarily consists of imports and symbol exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple encoder builder classes from an internal module and explicitly defines the public API via __all__. There are no data processing, input handling, or execution commands. The structure and content are typical for module exports. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are observed. The code is straightforward and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code solely exports classes from an internal module without performing any data processing or network activity. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
