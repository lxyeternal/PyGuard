{
  "purpose": "The code defines type imports and exposes them as module exports for use in a PostgreSQL-related Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pgpq._pgpq' module, including type annotations and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks, external connections, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports and exposes types.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. Use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code performs conditional import for type checking and imports various database-related types and classes from an internal module. It then exposes these as module attributes. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or data manipulations. The structure is typical for a Python package aiming for type safety and clean API exposure. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign module for type annotations and exporting classes. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
