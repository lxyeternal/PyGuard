{
  "purpose": "This code defines type aliases and imports for PostgreSQL-related data types and structures, likely used in database schema definitions or data handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'pgpq._pgpq' module, specifically the PostgreSQL data types and classes.",
  "targets": "No direct handling of untrusted data, user input, or external data sources present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and re-exports selected classes, with no data flow from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets observed. The import pattern and use of __all__ are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it conditionally imports a type for type checking, then imports several PostgreSQL data types and classes from an internal module, and finally defines __all__ for exports. There are no dynamic executions, no input handling, and no external data manipulation. The structure is typical for defining module API exposure. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module for defining and exposing PostgreSQL-related data types. It does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
