{
  "purpose": "This module imports various PostgreSQL data types and classes from an internal package and exposes them via __all__ for external use, primarily serving as a type definitions and API layer.",
  "sources": "Imports from pgpq._pgpq, including type classes and data types, and the conditional import for PostgresType during type checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or external data handling present; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Import statements flow into the module's namespace, then into __all__, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected; standard import/export pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured Python module that imports PostgreSQL data types and classes from an internal package, conditionally imports a type for type hints, and exposes these via __all__. It contains no dynamic execution, data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The use of TYPE_CHECKING is standard for type hints without runtime overhead. No signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or suspicious logic are present. The code serves as a type alias and API exposure layer, with no external data flow or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions as a standard module for defining and exporting PostgreSQL data types, and all assessments and scores are consistent with this analysis.",
