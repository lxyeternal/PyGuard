{
  "purpose": "The code defines imports and exports for a module related to PostgreSQL data types, primarily for type hinting and module organization.",
  "sources": "The code reads type information from the 'typing' module and imports from the internal 'pgpq._pgpq' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or external inputs are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only imports and exports module components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard module setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing 'TYPE_CHECKING' from 'typing' to handle type hints without affecting runtime. It conditionally imports 'PostgresType' for type checking purposes. Subsequently, it imports various PostgreSQL data types and constructs them into an __all__ list for public API exposure. The code serves as a module interface for PostgreSQL data type representations, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module setup for managing PostgreSQL type representations and does not contain any malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
