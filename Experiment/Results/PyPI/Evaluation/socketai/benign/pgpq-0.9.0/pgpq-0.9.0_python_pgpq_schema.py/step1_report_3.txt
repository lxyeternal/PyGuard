{
  "purpose": "The code defines type imports and exports for a PostgreSQL-related Python module, primarily for type hinting and module interface purposes.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from the 'pgpq._pgpq' module via import statements.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the code only imports and exports types and classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely establishes type annotations and module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears straightforward and consistent with standard Python module structure.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional import for TYPE_CHECKING to avoid runtime overhead, importing types for type hints. It then imports several classes and types from a private module 'pgpq._pgpq'. These are exported via __all__ for module interface. The structure is typical for type-annotated Python modules, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup for type hinting and exporting classes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
