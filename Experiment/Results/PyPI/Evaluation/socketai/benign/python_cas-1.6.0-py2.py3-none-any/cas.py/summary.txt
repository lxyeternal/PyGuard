  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of a CAS client supporting multiple versions and SAML. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage are evident. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the risk score is minimal, reflecting standard security considerations for such authentication libraries."
