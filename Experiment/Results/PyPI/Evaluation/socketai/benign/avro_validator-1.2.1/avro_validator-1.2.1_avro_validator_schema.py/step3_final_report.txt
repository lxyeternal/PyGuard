  "purpose": "Load and parse an Avro schema from a file or JSON string, returning a RecordType object.",
  "sources": "Reading from a file, reading the schema string, json.loads() parsing the schema",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks or network activity",
  "flows": "Input source (file or string) -> json.loads() -> RecordType.build()",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling masking specific errors, but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code reads a schema either from a file or directly from a string, with fallback exception handling. It parses the JSON schema and constructs a RecordType object. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The broad exception handling could mask file errors but does not introduce malicious behavior. The use of json.loads() is standard and safe in this context. External library usage appears legitimate. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for schema loading and parsing, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
