{
  "purpose": "Defines a Schema class to load and parse an Avro schema from a file or string.",
  "sources": "Reads schema data from a file specified by the input parameter or directly uses the provided string.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; however, schema data is processed and parsed into a RecordType object.",
  "flows": "Input schema (file or string) -> stored in self._schema -> json.loads(self._schema) -> RecordType.build()",
  "anomalies": "Uses a broad exception handler to fallback to treating input as schema string, which could mask file access issues but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to read schema data from a file; if it fails, it treats the input as a schema string. The parse method loads the JSON schema and builds a RecordType. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code relies on external libraries for validation but does not perform any unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of schema loading and parsing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
