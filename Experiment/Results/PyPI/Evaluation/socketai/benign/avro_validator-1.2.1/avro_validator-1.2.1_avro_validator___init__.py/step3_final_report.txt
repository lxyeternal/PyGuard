  "purpose": "Import statements for data type and schema classes used in data serialization, likely in an Avro context.",
  "sources": "Local modules '.avro_types' and '.schema' from which various classes are imported.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements do not process external input.",
  "flows": "None; the code only imports modules without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, embedded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from local modules, with no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
