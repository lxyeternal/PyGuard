{
  "purpose": "This code is importing various classes and functions from local modules, likely to define or process data schemas and types, possibly for data serialization or validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local modules '.avro_types' and '.schema' to import type definitions and schema structures.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this snippet; it only performs imports without executing untrusted data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows are established within this snippet; it merely sets up imports for use elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are present. The import statements are straightforward and typical for modular Python code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules. There is no data input, external network interaction, or execution of untrusted code. The structure is simple and standard for organizing schema-related classes. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are evident. Since this is just an import block, it does not introduce security risks by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import section establishing dependencies for schema and type definitions. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger codebase responsible for data schema handling.",
