  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of import statements from local modules related to data schema definitions. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution. Therefore, no issues such as vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present in the code snippet itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the benign nature of the code, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies. No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - `obfuscated`: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n   The confidence levels are high (1.0), which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports conclude no security risks or malware are present, there is no justification for increasing the risk scores. The code is purely import statements with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks identified.\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nGiven the code snippet is merely importing type definitions and schema components, the risk is negligible. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high confidence levels are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **Code Issues**: None.\n- **Malware**: 0.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0.\n- **Risk**: 0.\n\nThis analysis confirms the reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate.",
