{
  "purpose": "Import statements for various types and schema classes related to Avro data serialization",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.avro_types and .schema)",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; just static imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes and types related to Avro schema definitions from local modules. No functions, input handling, or data processing present. No indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. This appears to be a typical module import section establishing dependencies for schema handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only standard import statements without any malicious intent or security risks.",
