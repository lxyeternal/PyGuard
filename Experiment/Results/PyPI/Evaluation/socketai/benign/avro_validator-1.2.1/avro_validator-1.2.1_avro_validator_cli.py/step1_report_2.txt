  "purpose": "Command-line tool to validate JSON data against an Avro schema file.",
  "sources": "Reads schema file path from command-line argument; reads data file path from command-line argument; loads JSON data from specified file.",
  "sinks": "Uses open() to read schema and data files; parses schema; validates data against schema.",
  "flows": "Input file paths -> open() -> read files -> parse schema and JSON data -> validate data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; uses standard libraries and straightforward validation logic; no obfuscated code or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI script for JSON validation against an Avro schema, involving reading files, parsing JSON, and validating data. All file handling appears safe, and there are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. No unusual code patterns or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign command-line JSON validation utility with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs straightforward validation tasks securely.",
