  "purpose": "Command-line utility to validate JSON data against an Avro schema file.",
  "sources": "Reading schema file path, data file path, and JSON data from a file.",
  "sinks": "File existence checks, schema parsing, and validation may trigger errors or exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input file paths -> file existence checks -> schema parsing -> data loading -> validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Use of open() without explicit closing may be noted but is standard. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script takes file paths as command-line arguments, checks for their existence, then loads and validates data against a schema. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, nor code injection points. The use of 'open' is straightforward and not malicious. Error handling is standard. The 'Schema' class usage depends on external library but appears benign. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward validation utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It handles input files securely and performs schema validation without any evident malicious behavior.",
