  "purpose": "Command-line utility to validate JSON data against an Avro schema.",
  "sources": "Reads schema file and data file from filesystem; loads data via json.load()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external system interactions",
  "flows": "Reads files -> parses JSON -> validates data against schema",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without context managers; no input sanitization beyond existence checks",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool for JSON validation with standard library usage and a custom Schema class. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The only technical concern is the use of open() without a context manager, which is a best practice but not a security flaw. The schema validation appears standard, and no secrets or credentials are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The minimal risk stems from a coding style issue rather than security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minor coding best practice concerns.",
