  "purpose": "Command-line tool for validating JSON data against an Avro schema file.",
  "sources": "Reading schema file from a path provided as argument; reading data file from a path provided as argument.",
  "sinks": "Loading JSON data from a file; parsing schema; validating data against schema; printing error messages.",
  "flows": "User provides file paths -> code checks existence -> loads schema and data -> validates data -> outputs result.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Use of open() without validation or sanitization is standard for file I/O, not malicious. No external network connections, obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file existence checks, loads files, parses schema, and validates JSON data. It uses standard libraries and a local Schema class for validation. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. No sensitive information handling, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign command-line utility for schema validation. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The usage of open() is standard, and there are no signs of malware or security threats.",
