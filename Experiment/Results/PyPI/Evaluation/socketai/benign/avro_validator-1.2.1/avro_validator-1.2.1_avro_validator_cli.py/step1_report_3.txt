  "purpose": "Command-line tool for validating JSON data against an Avro schema.",
  "sources": "Reading files specified by user: schema_file and data_file, and environment variables through os.path and sys.",
  "sinks": "json.load(open(args.data_file, 'r')) reads data from user-specified file; potential risk if file contents are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "File existence check -> Load schema file -> Parse schema -> Load data file -> Validate data against schema.",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without context manager, which could lead to resource leaks, but no malicious intent or backdoors are evident. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs validation by reading user-supplied files and schema. It uses standard libraries and a custom Schema class for validation. No suspicious network activity, no code injection points, and no evident malicious behaviors. The only potential concern is the lack of context manager when opening files, which does not introduce security issues but is a coding best practice. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward validation utility with no signs of malicious intent. It handles input files securely by checking existence but does not perform any insecure operations or contain malware indicators. Overall, it appears safe.",
