  "purpose": "A command-line utility to validate JSON data against an Avro schema file.",
  "sources": "User provides schema_file and data_file paths via command-line arguments; os.path.exists checks for file existence; json.load reads the data file.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data is read from the data_file and parsed; schema.parse and schema.validate process data; print outputs and sys.exit handle process termination.",
  "flows": "User input paths -> os.path.exists checks -> open(data_file) -> json.load -> schema.parse and schema.validate -> output messages",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context manager; no validation of file contents beyond existence; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; no malicious code or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation, file existence checks, schema parsing, and data validation with clear error handling. It relies on external Schema class for validation, which is not provided, so its internal security cannot be assessed here. The script handles user input cautiously and does not execute or evaluate untrusted code directly. There are no suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious operations observed. The only potential concern is the open() call without a context manager, which could lead to resource leaks but not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard schema validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely processes user input and handles errors appropriately. No malware or security threats are evident.",
