  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description; static parameters in setuptools.setup()",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without dynamic data flow",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, well-formed setup script with no suspicious or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python project. It reads a local README.md file and calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata, dependencies, classifiers, URLs, and entry points. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code adheres to standard practices and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. All signals indicate benign intent, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal, approximately 0 or 0.1, justified by the static nature of the script. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
