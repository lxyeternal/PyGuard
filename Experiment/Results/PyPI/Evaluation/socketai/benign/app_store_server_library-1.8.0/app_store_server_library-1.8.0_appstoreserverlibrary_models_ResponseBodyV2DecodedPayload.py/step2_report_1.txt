  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is a data class defining the structure for Apple server notification payloads (version 2).\n- All reports agree that it is a benign data container with no processing logic, external calls, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code relies on external classes for attribute creation, but these are presumably standard or benign.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code does **not** contain any logic that executes or processes untrusted data; it only defines data structures.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The attributes are optional and serve as a schema for incoming data.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No apparent errors or flaws in the code or reasoning.\n- The use of `attr` and custom attribute creation methods seems appropriate and standard.\n- The documentation links and structure are consistent.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, scores of 0 or very close to it are appropriate. Some reports give 0.1; this is acceptable but slightly conservative.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- Since there's no malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation, scores should remain at 0.\n- The security risk score can be 0, as the code does not introduce vulnerabilities or execute untrusted data.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is purely a data schema with no processing logic, external calls, or suspicious patterns. It is a standard data class for handling notifications from Apple, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security risks. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a risk score of zero.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Keep risk score at 0.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always monitor for any code that might be added later that could change this assessment, but based on the current snippet, the code is safe.",
