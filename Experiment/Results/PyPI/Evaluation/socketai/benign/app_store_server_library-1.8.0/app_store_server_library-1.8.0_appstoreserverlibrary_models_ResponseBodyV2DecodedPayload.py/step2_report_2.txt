  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a data model for decoding Apple server notifications (version 2).\n- No suspicious behaviors, such as code execution, network calls, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation, are identified.\n- The code relies on external classes and utility methods for attribute creation, but these are standard patterns and do not introduce security concerns.\n- The data fields are optional and serve as a schema for incoming data, with no processing logic present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the purpose described: defining data structures for notification payloads.\n- No issues are present in the code itself based on the provided snippet.\n- The report conclusions about benignity are consistent with the code.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The use of optional fields aligns with the expected variability of incoming data.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), aligning with the benign analysis.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), consistent with the clear, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The code is purely a data container, with no active processing or external calls.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the scope of data modeling.\n- The use of external attribute creation methods does not introduce security risks; these are standard patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation present.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, as the code is a data model; unlikely to introduce security issues.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- Since the code is only defining data structures, the scores could remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a very low risk score.\n- The high confidence levels across reports support this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Estimate |\n|-------------------|----------------|\n| Malware           | 0              |\n| Obfuscated        | 0              |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1            |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, well-structured data model for handling Apple notification payloads, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
