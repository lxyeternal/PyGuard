  "purpose": "Define a data structure for decoding version 2 Apple server notifications, including various optional fields related to in-app purchase events.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (.Data, .ExternalPurchaseToken, .LibraryUtility, .NotificationTypeV2, .Subtype, .Summary); class attributes initialized with potential input data from notification payloads.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external interactions observed within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from notification payload fields into class attributes; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Python class ResponseBodyV2DecodedPayload using the attrs library, with fields representing various parts of a notification payload. All fields are optional and include documentation links. The class inherits from AttrsRawValueAware and utilizes factory methods from imported classes to create attributes. The code only establishes data models without executing logic, external calls, or untrusted data handling. There are no indications of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward data model for decoding Apple server notifications. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no security risks. It serves as a container for notification data without executing or transmitting untrusted data beyond assignment.",
