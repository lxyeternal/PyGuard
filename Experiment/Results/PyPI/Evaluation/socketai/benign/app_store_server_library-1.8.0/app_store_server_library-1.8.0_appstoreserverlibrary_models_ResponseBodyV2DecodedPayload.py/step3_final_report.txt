  "purpose": "Define a data class for decoding Apple server notification payloads (version 2).",
  "sources": "Input data fields such as rawNotificationType, rawSubtype, notificationUUID, data, summary, externalPurchaseToken, version, signedDate.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines data structures without processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Data is assigned to class attributes; no active data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward data schema with optional fields and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard data class using attrs, with optional fields corresponding to Apple notification documentation. It contains no logic, external calls, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The high confidence scores reflect the straightforward nature of the code. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present, and the code serves solely as a data container.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data schema for Apple notifications, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1.",
  "confidence": 1,
