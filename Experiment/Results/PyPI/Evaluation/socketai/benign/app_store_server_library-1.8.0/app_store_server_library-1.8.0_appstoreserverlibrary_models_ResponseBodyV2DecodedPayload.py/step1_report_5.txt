{
  "purpose": "Defines a data class representing a decoded payload for version 2 Apple server notifications.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, imported modules, class methods (create_main_attr, create_raw_attr), and optional data fields.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or potentially malicious actions, as the code primarily sets up data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input attributes into class fields, but there are no active flows or processing of untrusted data within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated constructs. The code primarily uses standard library features and well-defined data attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class with several optional fields representing parts of a notification payload. It uses type annotations, external class methods for attribute creation, and docstrings referencing official Apple documentation. No data processing, network activity, or untrusted data handling occurs here. The code appears to be a straightforward data structure setup without malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a data container with no active processing or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a standard, well-structured data class definition.",
