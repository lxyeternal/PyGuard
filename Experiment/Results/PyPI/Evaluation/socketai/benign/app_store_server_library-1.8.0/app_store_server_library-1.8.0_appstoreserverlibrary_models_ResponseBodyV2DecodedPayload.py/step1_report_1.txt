  "purpose": "Define a data structure for handling version 2 notification payloads from the App Store Server Notifications API.",
  "sources": "Input data likely originates from external notifications sent by Apple's servers, particularly the raw notification payloads.",
  "sinks": "The code itself does not process untrusted data directly, but the data fields can potentially be used downstream for logging, storage, or further processing.",
  "flows": "Untrusted notification data flows from external sources into the attributes of ResponseBodyV2DecodedPayload, but no explicit processing or handling is shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, network calls, or obfuscated code. Use of type hints and data class pattern is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a structured data class with optional fields representing parts of the notification payload. It relies on external classes for attribute creation and data validation. No dynamic code execution, external calls, or suspicious logic is present. The class is designed for data storage and transfer, not processing or execution. There are no signs of malware or security risks within this isolated code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data structure definition for handling notifications from Apple's servers. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. It serves as a model for received data rather than executing any harmful operations.",
