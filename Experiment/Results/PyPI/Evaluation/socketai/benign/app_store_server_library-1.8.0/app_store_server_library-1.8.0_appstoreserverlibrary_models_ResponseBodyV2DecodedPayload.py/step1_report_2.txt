{
  "purpose": "Definition of a data model class for decoding version 2 notification payloads from the Apple App Store Server Notifications API.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (attr, typing, relative modules Data, ExternalPurchaseToken, etc.), class attributes initialized with optional types, and static method calls for attribute creation.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the class is primarily a data container without data processing or external communication logic.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the class does not process input directly but defines structure for incoming data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of third-party libraries appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class for structured data representation, using 'attr' and custom attribute creation methods. All fields are optional and serve as data holders. No code execution, data processing, or external interactions are present. The class appears to be a schema/model for incoming notification payloads without any malicious logic or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data model definition with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply structures data for decoding notification payloads and does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
