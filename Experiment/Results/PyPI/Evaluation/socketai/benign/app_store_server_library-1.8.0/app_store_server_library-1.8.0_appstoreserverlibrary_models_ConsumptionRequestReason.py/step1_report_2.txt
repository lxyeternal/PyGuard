  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class for refund request reasons related to Apple Store server notifications.",
  "sources": "Imports from enum module and a local utility module (.LibraryUtility). The code reads data from class attributes and string constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no input/output, network, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines a static enum class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code detected. The class appears to be straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, including a metaclass from a local utility module, and defines a string-based Enum class for refund reasons. No input handling, network operations, or data manipulation occurs. The enum values are static strings linked to Apple documentation. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-defined enumeration for refund reasons, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a data structure for the application logic, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
