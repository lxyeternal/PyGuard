  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their findings, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard API client for Apple, reads inputs, generates JWTs, sends requests, handles responses.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or suspicious data handling; straightforward request-response flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-structured, legitimate client with high confidence (0.95). Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** This appears to be a standard, secure, well-implemented API client. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on cryptography and request signing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** JWT signing with external keys, sending sensitive data over HTTP, no obfuscation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. Uses cryptography appropriately.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, secure client library. Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity; standard cryptographic practices observed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Implements a comprehensive API client, with focus on request signing and data handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Sends data via requests, handles sensitive info properly.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. Uses standard libraries.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, secure, with high confidence. Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent; appears to be a typical API client.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, with detailed flow analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Proper handling of JWT tokens, HTTP requests, and responses.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation. Handles cryptography and network interactions securely.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence. Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious activity; standard secure implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar API client, handling subscription management, requests, and responses.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Sends data over HTTP, generates JWTs securely.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, secure, with high confidence. Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify actual code issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors.\n- **Logical Flaws or Mistakes:** All reports agree on the code's legitimacy and security.\n- **Scores & Reasoning:** All malware scores are 0, obfuscated scores are 0, and risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n- **Potential Malicious Claims:** No claims are based on assumptions; all findings are consistent with a standard API client.\n- **Overall Security Posture:** The code is a well-structured, standard client library for Apple's API, handling cryptography, HTTP requests, and response parsing securely.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Based on the detailed reports and analysis, I concur with the given scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1-0.2 (minimal, primarily due to handling sensitive data and external dependencies)\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard API client security)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, secure, well-implemented client for Apple's App Store Server API. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware score correctly reflects the absence of malicious intent.",
