  "purpose": "A secure, standard API client for Apple's App Store Server API, handling token generation, request formation, and response parsing.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters for cryptographic keys, request bodies, and query parameters; generates JWT tokens; sends HTTP requests; processes responses.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks or suspicious data handling; requests and responses are straightforward and standard.",
  "flows": "Source: cryptographic key input, request bodies, query parameters -> Token generation and request sending -> Response parsing and error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured API client that handles cryptography, HTTP requests, and response parsing securely. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. External keys are passed as parameters, which is standard practice. The request flow is straightforward, with proper error handling. No suspicious patterns or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and well-implemented client for Apple's App Store Server API. It shows no malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and risk score (~0.1) are appropriate given the code's purpose and structure.",
