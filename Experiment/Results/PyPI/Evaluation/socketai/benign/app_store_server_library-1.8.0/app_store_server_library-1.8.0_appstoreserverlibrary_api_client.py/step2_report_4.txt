  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described logic, and assess the scores and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a client for Apple’s App Store API, with standard request/response handling, JWT token generation, and error management.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low).  \n  **Reasoning:** The low risk score is appropriate; the code is a straightforward API client with no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar client library with emphasis on cryptographic signing, token generation, and HTTP request handling.\n- **Assessment:** No hardcoded secrets; the signing key is passed as a parameter. No obfuscation or malicious patterns. The code uses standard cryptography and HTTP libraries.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n  **Reasoning:** The low risk score is justified. The use of external keys and libraries is standard, and no malicious behavior is detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements a client with JWT signing, request formation, and response parsing.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The signing key is provided externally, which is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n  **Reasoning:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) may reflect the handling of sensitive data and network interactions, but given the context, this is still low. The code is a legitimate API client.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score is acceptable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with emphasis on secure token generation and request handling.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation. Proper handling of credentials and data.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n  **Reasoning:** The low risk score is justified; no malicious intent or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a standard API client with JWT, request formation, and response parsing.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. Uses external libraries appropriately.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n  **Reasoning:** The low risk score is justified; no security concerns detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a legitimate, well-structured API client for Apple’s App Store Server API.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The risk scores, mostly around 0.1-0.2, are reasonable given the context and the low likelihood of security issues.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1-0.2 (low, due to network interactions and handling of sensitive data, but no vulnerabilities)\n\n**In summary:** The supply chain security risk for this code is minimal. It functions as a standard, secure API client with no malicious or suspicious features.",
