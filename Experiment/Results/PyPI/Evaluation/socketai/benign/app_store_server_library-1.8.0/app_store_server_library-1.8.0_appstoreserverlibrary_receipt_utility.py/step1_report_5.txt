{
  "purpose": "Extracts transaction IDs from Apple in-app purchase and transaction receipts for server-side validation and processing.",
  "sources": "Input strings 'app_receipt' and 'transaction_receipt' which are base64-encoded receipt data, and regex search results within decoded transaction receipts.",
  "sinks": "Return statements providing extracted transaction IDs; no data is sent over network, written to files, or used insecurely within the code itself.",
  "flows": "Base64-decoded receipt data is parsed via ASN.1 decoding to locate transaction ID fields. Regex extracts base64-encoded segments, which are decoded to find transaction IDs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Custom ASN.1 decoder handles indefinite length encoding, which is appropriate for receipt parsing. No suspicious network activity or file operations present.",
  "analysis": "The code securely decodes and parses Apple receipt data, extracting transaction IDs through ASN.1 decoding and regex matching. The ASN.1 decoding properly handles indefinite length encoding, reducing parsing errors. No external network calls, file I/O, or credential management are present. The code relies on standard cryptographic and parsing techniques without obfuscation or hidden behaviors. The absence of external data transmission or malicious code indicates a benign intent, primarily serving a validation purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for extracting transaction IDs from Apple receipts. It uses standard libraries and proper decoding methods. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The implementation appears safe and intended solely for receipt validation.",
