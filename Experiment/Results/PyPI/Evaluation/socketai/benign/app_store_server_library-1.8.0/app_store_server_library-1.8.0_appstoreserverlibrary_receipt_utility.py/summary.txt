  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious utility for extracting transaction IDs from Apple receipts. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the absence of receipt validation, which is acknowledged but not malicious. The scores reflect a low security risk and no malicious intent."
