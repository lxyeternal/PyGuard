{
  "purpose": "Extracts transaction IDs from Apple in-app purchase receipts and transaction receipts using ASN.1 decoding and regex parsing.",
  "sources": "Base64-encoded receipt strings, ASN.1 encoded data structures within receipts.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is parsed and returned internally without network or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Base64 decoding -> ASN.1 decoding to locate receipt data -> regex extraction of transaction IDs from decoded strings.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors; the ASN.1 decoder handles indefinite length encoding appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ASN.1 parsing of Apple receipts, extracting transaction IDs without validation. It uses ASN.1 decoding with support for indefinite length encoding, which is necessary for receipt structures. Regex is used to extract transaction IDs from decoded strings. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. The lack of validation is a known limitation but not malicious. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical receipt parsing utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious utility for extracting transaction IDs from Apple receipts. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the absence of receipt validation, which is acknowledged but not malicious. The scores reflect a low security risk and no malicious intent.",
