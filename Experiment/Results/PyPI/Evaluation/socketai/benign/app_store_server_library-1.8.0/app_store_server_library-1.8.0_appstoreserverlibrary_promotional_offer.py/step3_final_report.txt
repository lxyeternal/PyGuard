  "purpose": "Generate cryptographic signatures for Apple promotional offers using a provided private key and specific parameters.",
  "sources": "External PEM-encoded private key input, function parameters (product_identifier, subscription_offer_id, application_username, nonce, timestamp).",
  "sinks": "The signing operation outputs a Base64-encoded signature; no data leaks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are concatenated with a Unicode separator, then signed with the private key; the signature is encoded and returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of Unicode U+2063 separator is unusual but documented; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code securely loads an external private key, constructs a payload string with concatenated parameters, signs it with ECDSA SHA-256, and encodes the signature in Base64. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The use of a Unicode separator is unconventional but aligns with Apple's signing specifications. The private key management outside this code is critical but outside the scope of this review. Overall, the implementation is standard, correct, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure cryptographic utility for generating promotional offer signatures. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on external private key handling. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
