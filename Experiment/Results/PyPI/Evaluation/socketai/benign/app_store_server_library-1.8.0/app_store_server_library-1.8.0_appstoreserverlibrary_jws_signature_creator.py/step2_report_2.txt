  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code generates JWTs for Apple Store requests, with no malicious activity detected.\n- **Findings:** The code loads private keys securely, constructs claims, signs tokens, and encodes data appropriately.\n- **Assessment:** No obfuscation, no suspicious network activity, no malicious logic.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0/0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard implementation.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment is accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on JWT signing for Apple Store verification.\n- **Findings:** Proper key handling, claim construction, and signing. No suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code; no malicious behavior.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0/0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis is justified; the code appears secure and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on generating JWTs for in-app purchase validation.\n- **Findings:** Uses standard cryptography, proper key handling, and data encoding.\n- **Assessment:** No obfuscation or malicious activity detected.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0/0, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate implementation.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar purpose—signing JWTs for Apple Store requests.\n- **Findings:** Proper use of cryptography, no hardcoded secrets, standard practices.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0/0, justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure and legitimate.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on JWT signing for Apple Store Connect requests.\n- **Findings:** Validates inputs, uses cryptography properly, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity or backdoors.\n- **Risk/Malware Score:** 0/0, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate implementation.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe code that loads private keys, constructs claims, and signs JWTs for Apple Store-related purposes.\n- **Security & Maliciousness:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious network activity, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as zero, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Potential Risks:** The only general concern is private key management outside this code, but within the code, operations are standard and secure.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, structured, and standard.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.2 — minimal, mostly due to external key management considerations, not the code itself.\n\n**Additional Notes:**  \n- The code appears to follow best practices for cryptographic signing of JWTs.\n- No evidence of supply chain sabotage or malicious payloads.\n- The logic is straightforward, with proper input validation and secure cryptographic operations.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe supply chain security risk for this code is very low. It is a legitimate, well-structured implementation for generating signed JWTs for Apple Store services, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
