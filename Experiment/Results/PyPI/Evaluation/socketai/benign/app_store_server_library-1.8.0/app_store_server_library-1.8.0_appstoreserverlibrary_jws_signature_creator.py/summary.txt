  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation for generating signed JWTs for Apple Store services. It shows no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The overall security risk is very low, primarily dependent on external key management practices. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal operational risk."
