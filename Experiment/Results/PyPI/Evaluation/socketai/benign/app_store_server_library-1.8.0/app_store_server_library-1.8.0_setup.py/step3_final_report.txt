{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a library, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports pathlib and setuptools modules; uses find_packages and setup functions; specifies dependencies and package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows, network calls, or data leaks; no dynamic code execution or user input handling.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It imports standard modules, reads a README file, and calls setup() with metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. Dependencies are common packages with specified versions. There are no dynamic behaviors, network activity, or data processing. The code is clear, readable, and follows best practices. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. All dependencies are well-known, and the code does not perform any runtime actions that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
