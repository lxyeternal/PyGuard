{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'app-store-server-library' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing standard libraries; defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external input/output or data processing involving untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code mainly defines package setup without data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup routine using setuptools, specifying package metadata, dependencies, and other configuration parameters. No suspicious behavior, such as network communication, data leaks, or malicious code, is present. The dependencies are typical for a Python package involving cryptography and requests, with no signs of malicious intent. The reading of 'README.md' is standard for long description configuration. The code adheres to conventional setup script practices without anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a normal package configuration file with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks based on the provided content.",
