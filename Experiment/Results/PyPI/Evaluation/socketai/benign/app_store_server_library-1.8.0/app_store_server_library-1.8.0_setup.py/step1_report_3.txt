  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'app-store-server-library' Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing modules for package discovery and setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data is processed or executed; no external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup configuration is static and standard.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to follow standard setup.py structure without suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pathlib and setuptools modules to configure package metadata and dependencies. It reads a README.md file for long description. The setup() function specifies package details, dependencies, and extras. No user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution are present. The dependencies listed are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward and aligns with common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not contain any malware, obfuscated code, or security risks.",
