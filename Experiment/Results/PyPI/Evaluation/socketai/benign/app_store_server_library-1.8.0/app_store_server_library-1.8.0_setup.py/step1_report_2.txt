  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'app-store-server-library' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; defining package dependencies and metadata in setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or execution points that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "Reading file content to populate long_description; passing static configuration data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution observed",
  "analysis": "The script imports pathlib for filesystem operations and setuptools for packaging. It reads a README file for the package description, then defines package metadata, dependencies, and extra requirements. All dependencies are standard libraries or well-known packages. The code contains no runtime data processing, user input handling, or network communication. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup configuration script for packaging a Python library. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a typical, safe setup script with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
