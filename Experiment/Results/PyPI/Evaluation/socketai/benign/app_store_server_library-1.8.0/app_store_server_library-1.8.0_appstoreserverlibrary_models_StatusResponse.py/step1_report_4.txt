{
  "purpose": "Define a data model class StatusResponse for handling subscription status information within the app's server communication.",
  "sources": "Reads environment configuration, raw environment string, bundle ID, app Apple ID, and a list of subscription items.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data is used insecurely; no data output or network communication within this code.",
  "flows": "Data is set through class instantiation, with no explicit data flow leading to insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing and attribute libraries, defines a class with optional attributes, and includes descriptive docstrings with external references. It appears to be a straightforward data container for subscription status information, with no dynamic execution or data manipulation beyond attribute definitions. The environment attributes and data list are typical for such models. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple data model for subscription status and does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a legitimate part of an app store server API integration.",
