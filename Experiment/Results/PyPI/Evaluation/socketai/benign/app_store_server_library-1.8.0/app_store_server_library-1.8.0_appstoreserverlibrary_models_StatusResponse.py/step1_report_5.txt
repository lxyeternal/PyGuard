  "purpose": "Define a data class for handling status responses related to Apple auto-renewable subscriptions, including environment info, bundle ID, app ID, and subscription data.",
  "sources": "Environment.create_main_attr('rawEnvironment') and Environment.create_raw_attr('environment') for environment data; attr.ib defaults for bundleId, appAppleId, and data.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or manipulation could occur if the 'environment', 'bundleId', or 'appAppleId' fields are influenced by untrusted sources, but no direct sinks like network, file I/O, or eval are present.",
  "flows": "Data may flow from external input into environment, bundleId, appAppleId, and data fields; these are simple attribute assignments with no complex processing or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic; use of third-party libraries (attr, typing) appears benign. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with optional attributes representing subscription status data, using standard Python data class conventions. The environment attribute uses methods from the Environment class, but there is no evidence of unsafe or malicious operations. No external data handling, network operations, or security-sensitive operations are embedded. The structure appears straightforward and consistent with typical API response modeling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data class for representing subscription status information with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply models data structure without performing any operations that could be exploited.",
