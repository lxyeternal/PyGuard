  "purpose": "A data model representing the status response for a customer's auto-renewable subscriptions, used in API responses.",
  "sources": "External input data populating the environment, rawEnvironment, bundleId, appAppleId, and data attributes.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines data attributes without processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "External data flows into the class attributes; no internal processing or data flow beyond attribute assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward data class with optional attributes and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple, well-structured data class using attrs and type annotations, with optional fields for subscription status info. It imports external modules presumed safe, and contains no dynamic code, network I/O, or security-sensitive operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. The attributes serve as a schema for API responses, and the code is purely declarative. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign, non-operational nature of this code. Minor risk scores like 0.1 are overestimations given the lack of actual vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data model for handling subscription status responses. No malicious, obfuscated, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores across reports are appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.",
