{
  "purpose": "Define a data model class for status responses related to auto-renewable subscriptions in an app, encapsulating environment info, bundle ID, app ID, and subscription data.",
  "sources": "The code reads optional environment variables, string attributes, integer attributes, and a list of subscription items.",
  "sinks": "Data is stored in class attributes; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources is evident within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from attribute assignments into the class instance, with no external data handling or output flows visible.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard libraries and data modeling without obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class using the attrs library, with optional attributes and type annotations. It imports and utilizes other classes for environment and subscription data, and documents each attribute with comments and URLs. No data processing, external system calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard data container for API responses, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data model definition for subscription status responses. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code patterns, and no security risks. It is safe and typical for API data handling.",
