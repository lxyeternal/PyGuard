{
  "purpose": "Define a data structure representing a status response for Apple's App Store server API, including environment, app ID, bundle ID, and subscription details.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from API responses or external data sources populating the fields: environment, rawEnvironment, bundleId, appAppleId, data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external sources into class attributes; no processing or untrusted data flow pathways are implemented within the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code solely defines data attributes with standard types and initializers.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries, defines a data class with optional fields, and references external modules. It appears to be a straightforward data container without any dynamic code execution, malicious logic, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious behavior. The class serves as a schema for API responses and does not perform any operations or external communications itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data class definition for API response handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intentionally designed for data storage.",
