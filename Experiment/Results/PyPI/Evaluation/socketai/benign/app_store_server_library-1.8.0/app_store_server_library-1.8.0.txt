No malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation is detected. The overall security risk is low, with a score of approximately 0.2, primarily due to reliance on external network responses and environment-based signature verification bypasses in testing environments."

It shows no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The overall security risk is very low, primarily dependent on external key management practices. The malware and obfuscation scores are zero, and the risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal operational risk."
