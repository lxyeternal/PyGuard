  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented cryptographic verification utility for Apple App Store data. It includes environment-specific bypasses justified for testing purposes. No malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation is detected. The overall security risk is low, with a score of approximately 0.2, primarily due to reliance on external network responses and environment-based signature verification bypasses in testing environments."
