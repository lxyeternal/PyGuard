  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some data processing or utility functions, but without additional context or comments, its primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, hardcoded strings, and possibly user inputs (if any).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files, makes network requests, or executes system commands based on the code structure.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or input sources flows into processing functions, potentially leading to network or system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads; however, the absence of comments and potential for dynamic execution pose some concern. If there are use of eval, exec, or dynamic imports, they would be suspicious, but not indicated here.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and does not contain obvious malicious constructs. It reads environment variables, processes data, and possibly interacts with system resources. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors. The lack of comments or documentation makes full assessment difficult, but there are no immediate red flags. No obfuscated code features are evident, and no suspicious functions are called. The structure and syntax are standard.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the visible code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, with no indicators of malware or malicious intent. Confidence is moderate due to lack of context, but the risk level appears low.",
