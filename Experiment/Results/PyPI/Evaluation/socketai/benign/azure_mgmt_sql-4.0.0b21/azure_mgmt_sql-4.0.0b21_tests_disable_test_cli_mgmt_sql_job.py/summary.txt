  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure SQL resource management test script with security risks due to hardcoded secrets. It does not contain malware or malicious payloads. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a moderate security risk score around 0.4 to reflect insecure credential handling. Addressing secret management would improve security posture, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain compromise."
