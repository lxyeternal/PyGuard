There is no evidence of malware, sabotage, or obfuscation. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to zero. The risk score should reflect moderate concern (~0.3), mainly due to insecure secrets, but no active malicious behavior is present."

The primary security concern is the presence of hardcoded credentials, which should be managed securely in production environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low to moderate (~0.3) due to credential exposure."

The minor security concern relates to hardcoded test credentials and fixed IP addresses, which are acceptable in testing but should be replaced with secure, environment-based secrets in production."
