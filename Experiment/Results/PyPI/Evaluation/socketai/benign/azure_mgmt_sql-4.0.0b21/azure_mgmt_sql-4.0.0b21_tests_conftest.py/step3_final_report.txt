{
  "purpose": "The code sets up sanitizers to mask sensitive environment variables, headers, and JSON body keys during testing recordings to prevent leakage of credentials and tokens.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET), HTTP headers ('Set-Cookie', 'Cookie'), JSON body key ('$..access_token')",
  "sinks": "Sanitizers replace sensitive data in logs and recordings; no data leaks or external effects occur",
  "flows": "Code reads environment variables and applies sanitizers to headers and JSON keys during test recording processes",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; minor typo in comment ('aovid' instead of 'avoid') but not security relevant",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard sanitization for testing environments by masking sensitive credentials and tokens. It reads environment variables and applies regex sanitizers to headers and JSON keys. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The purpose is legitimate, and the implementation aligns with common testing practices. No anomalies or obfuscation are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign sanitization setup used in testing to prevent sensitive data leakage. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerability. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
