{
  "purpose": "The code sets up environment variable sanitization and header/body sanitization for testing purposes, mainly to prevent sensitive information from being recorded during test recordings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for subscription ID, tenant ID, client ID, client secret; headers like 'Set-Cookie' and 'Cookie'; body key '$..access_token'.",
  "sinks": "Sanitizers apply to data that could include sensitive credentials or tokens, preventing them from being exposed in logs or recordings.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as sources, then sanitized with regex; headers and JSON body data are sanitized before logging or recording, ensuring sensitive data does not leak.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets other than default placeholder values, and no dynamic or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and explicitly for sanitization purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports environment variables related to Azure credentials and applies regex-based sanitization to prevent leakage during testing recordings. The use of placeholder default values indicates the variables are sensitive and should not be exposed. Sanitizers are correctly configured to mask these secrets. The code’s purpose is to sanitize sensitive data during tests, which is a best practice, not malicious. No suspicious behaviors, code injection, or backdoors are present. The overall structure is clean, and no obfuscation is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing utility to sanitize sensitive credentials and tokens, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or obfuscation, and the security risk is minimal.",
