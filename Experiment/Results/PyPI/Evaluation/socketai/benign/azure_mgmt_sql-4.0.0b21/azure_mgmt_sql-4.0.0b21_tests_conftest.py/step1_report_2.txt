{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to set up test fixtures for sanitizing sensitive information in test recordings, specifically targeting environment variables and HTTP headers or body keys.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET); HTTP headers (Set-Cookie, Cookie); JSON body keys (access_token).",
  "sinks": "Sanitization functions that replace sensitive data in test recordings; no data is sent or received over network in this code.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read and sanitized; header and body key sanitizers are applied to remove sensitive information during testing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; all operations are related to data sanitization for testing purposes. No hardcoded credentials other than placeholders are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for environment variable management and test utilities. It loads environment variables, then uses a fixture to set up sanitizers that mask sensitive information such as subscription IDs, tenant IDs, client IDs, client secrets, cookies, and access tokens in test recordings. The sanitizers replace actual sensitive data with generic placeholders, preventing sensitive data exposure during testing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code appears to be part of a testing setup for security and privacy compliance.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard sanitization setup for testing environments, aimed at masking sensitive information in test data. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
