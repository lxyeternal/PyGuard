{
  "purpose": "The code sets up environment variable sanitization and header/body sanitizers for testing purposes, specifically to mask sensitive data in recordings during testing.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for subscription ID, tenant ID, client ID, and client secret; headers such as Set-Cookie and Cookie; JSON body key 'access_token'.",
  "sinks": "Sanitizers modify the data before it is recorded or output, preventing sensitive information leakage.",
  "flows": "Sensitive environment variables are read as sources, and their values are sanitized using regex patterns before being recorded or displayed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or malicious constructs; the code explicitly sanitizes potentially sensitive data, which is standard in testing environments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports environment variables and applies regex sanitization to mask sensitive data such as subscription IDs, tenant IDs, client IDs, client secrets, cookies, and access tokens during testing. This is common practice to avoid leaking sensitive information in logs or recordings. The use of environment variables, regex sanitization, and pytest fixtures are standard for test setup. No malicious or suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or obfuscation techniques are detected. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. It appears to be a legitimate setup for secure testing of Azure SDK or APIs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test fixture setup designed to sanitize sensitive data during testing. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It primarily aims to protect sensitive information in test recordings.",
