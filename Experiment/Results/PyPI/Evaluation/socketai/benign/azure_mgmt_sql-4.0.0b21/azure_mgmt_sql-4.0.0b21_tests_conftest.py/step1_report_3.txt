  "purpose": "The code sets up environment variable sanitization for testing purposes, specifically to mask sensitive information such as Azure credentials in test recordings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET); input from test proxy, environment variables",
  "sinks": "Sanitizers applied to regex matches of environment variables and headers in test proxy; masking sensitive data in recordings",
  "flows": "Environment variable retrieval -> sanitization registration in test proxy -> masking sensitive data in recordings",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard for sanitizing sensitive data during tests. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables containing sensitive Azure credentials and sets up sanitizers to mask these credentials in test recordings using regex patterns. It also sanitizes headers such as 'Set-Cookie' and 'Cookie', as well as specific JSON body keys like 'access_token'. All operations are related to test data sanitization and do not involve any malicious or suspicious behavior. No external data leaks, backdoors, or malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is intended solely for sanitizing sensitive data in testing environments. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard practice for maintaining privacy during testing and recording, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
