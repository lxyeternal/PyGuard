{
  "purpose": "This code sets up environment variable sanitization and data masking for test recordings to prevent sensitive information leakage during testing.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables such as AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, and AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET.",
  "sinks": "Uses sanitizers to replace sensitive data in recorded test outputs (headers, body, regex matches).",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at the start and then sanitized in test recordings to prevent exposure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behavior detected. The code strictly focuses on sanitization for testing purposes. No obfuscated or unusual logic. All environment variables are used for masking purposes only.",
  "analysis": "The code loads environment variables related to Azure credentials, then applies sanitization to mask these credentials in test recordings. No external data inputs or network interactions are present. The functions are straightforward and aimed at privacy preservation during tests. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent. The use of environment variables and sanitization functions are standard practices in testing environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test setup for sanitizing sensitive information in test recordings. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
