  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Azure resource management testing script with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The main security concern is the use of hardcoded credentials, which should be replaced with secure secrets in production environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting testing context vulnerabilities."
