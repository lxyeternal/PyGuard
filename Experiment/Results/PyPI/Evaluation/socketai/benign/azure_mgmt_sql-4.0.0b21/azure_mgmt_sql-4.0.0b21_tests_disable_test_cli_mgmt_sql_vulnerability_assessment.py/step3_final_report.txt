{
  "purpose": "The code is a testing suite for managing Azure SQL resources and storage accounts, performing creation, configuration, retrieval, and deletion operations primarily for testing and validation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from hardcoded resource names, credentials (e.g., administrator passwords, storage keys), and environment checks during live runs.",
  "sinks": "API calls to Azure SDKs using sensitive parameters such as passwords and access keys, which could potentially lead to data leaks if misused outside controlled environments.",
  "flows": "Sensitive data from hardcoded variables or environment variables flows into Azure SDK API calls for resource creation, configuration, and deletion; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials (e.g., 'Un53cuRE!', 'accesskey') and placeholders; no obfuscation or malicious code patterns detected; code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code automates Azure resource management tasks for testing purposes, utilizing explicit resource names and credentials. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or exfiltration routines are present. The use of hardcoded secrets is typical in test scripts but poses security risks if used outside isolated environments. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are detected. The overall security risk is low, primarily due to credential handling, with malware and malicious intent scores appropriately set to zero. The code's behavior aligns with standard testing practices, and the absence of malicious activity is consistent across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Azure resource management testing script with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The main security concern is the use of hardcoded credentials, which should be replaced with secure secrets in production environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting testing context vulnerabilities.",
