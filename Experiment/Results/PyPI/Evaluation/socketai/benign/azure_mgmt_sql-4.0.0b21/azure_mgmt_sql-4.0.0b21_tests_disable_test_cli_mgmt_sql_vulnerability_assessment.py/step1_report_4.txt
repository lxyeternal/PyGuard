{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform automated testing and management of Azure SQL Database and Storage resources, including creation, configuration, vulnerability assessment, and deletion.",
  "sources": "User inputs include resource group names, server and database names, storage account and container names, and access keys. Access keys are obtained from storage account creation or hardcoded for testing.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with Azure management APIs for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting resources. Sensitive data such as access keys are used as parameters for management API calls.",
  "flows": "Input data (resource names, access keys) flows into API calls for resource creation and configuration. Access keys flow from storage account creation into vulnerability assessment setup. API responses are stored but not further processed or leaked.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded credentials such as administrator login and password, which is a security concern but not malicious. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malware behaviors are observed. No obfuscated code or hidden functionalities are present.",
  "analysis": "The script automates Azure resource management tasks, using input parameters for resource names and access keys. The access keys are retrieved during storage account creation or hardcoded for testing, which can be a security risk but not malicious. The code performs standard resource management operations, including creation, configuration, retrieval, and deletion, without any suspicious behavior or malicious payload. No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are detected. Sensitive information is used appropriately within API calls, and no data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate automation script for Azure resource management and vulnerability assessment testing. Although it contains some insecure practices like hardcoded credentials for testing purposes, there is no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It is primarily a testing and management utility with no malicious behaviors identified.",
