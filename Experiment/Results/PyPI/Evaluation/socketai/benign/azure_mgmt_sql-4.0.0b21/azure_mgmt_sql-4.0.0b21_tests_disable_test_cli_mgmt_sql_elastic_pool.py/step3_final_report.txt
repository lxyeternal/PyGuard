{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of automated unittests for managing Azure SQL resources, including creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting servers and elastic pools, primarily for testing SDK functionality.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded credentials ('dummylogin', 'Un53cuRE!') in server creation bodies, resource names, and API call parameters.",
  "sinks": "API calls to Azure management endpoints, resource creation/deletion, metric retrieval, and recommended pool retrieval.",
  "flows": "Credentials used during server creation; resource identifiers used in API calls; static resource names in API parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials in test scripts; no obfuscation or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard SDK usage for resource management; credentials are hardcoded for testing purposes, which is common but insecure outside controlled environments. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The main security concern is credential exposure, but this is typical in test scripts. Scores reflect low malware (0), no obfuscation (0), and low risk (~0.2-0.3) due to credential handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate testing code for Azure SQL resource management with no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The primary security issue is the use of hardcoded credentials, which should be managed securely in production environments. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
