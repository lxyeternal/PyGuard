{
  "purpose": "This code performs automated testing of Azure SQL management operations, including creating/deleting servers and elastic pools, and retrieving metrics and recommendations.",
  "sources": "Reads resource group names, server names, and credentials (administrator_login and password) during server creation.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data (credentials) in memory during server setup; network operations to Azure API endpoints (implied).",
  "flows": "Source data (credentials) flows into server creation API calls; API responses could leak data if improperly handled, but no explicit data exfiltration is visible.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials for server administrator login and password ('dummylogin' and 'Un53cuRE!'); the credentials are not protected and could be misused if the code is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Azure management operations with the Azure SDK, including resource creation, deletion, and metric retrieval. Credentials are hardcoded in the script, which is a security concern. No obfuscated code, malicious network connections, or suspicious code execution patterns are present. The test functions are decorated to be skipped, indicating they are for testing purposes only. No malware-like behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious network activity is detected. The main concern is the hardcoded credentials, which could be exploited if the code is shared or stored insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "The script contains hardcoded credentials, which pose a security risk, but no malicious behavior or malware is evident. The code appears to be a legitimate test script for Azure resource management. The risk primarily relates to credential exposure, not malicious intent.",
