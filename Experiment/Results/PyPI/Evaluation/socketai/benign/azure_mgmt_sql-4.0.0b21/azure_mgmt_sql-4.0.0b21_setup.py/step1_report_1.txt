  "purpose": "Setup script for the azure-mgmt-sql Python package, handling package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading version from version.py or _version.py, reading README.md, and CHANGELOG.md files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or insecure operations detected.",
  "flows": "Reading version file -> extracting version -> setup configuration using static data and files.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures: importing modules, defining package name, reading version info from files, and configuring setup(). All file accesses are for static package files and do not involve user input or untrusted sources. No code injection, network activity, or obfuscated code detected. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or privacy violations identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard practices and only reads local static files for configuration.",
