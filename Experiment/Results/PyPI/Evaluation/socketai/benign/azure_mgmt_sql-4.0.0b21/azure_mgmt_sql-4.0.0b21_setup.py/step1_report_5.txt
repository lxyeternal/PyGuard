{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package for distribution, specifically configuring metadata and dependencies for the azure-mgmt-sql package.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from a version.py or _version.py file, reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files, and imports standard libraries.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or transmits untrusted data or interacts with external systems in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local files -> passes package metadata to setup() -> no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The code is a standard setup script with conventional practices.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks for a Python package: reading version info, long descriptions, and configuring package metadata and dependencies. The version extraction uses regex on local files, which is a common pattern. No code injection, network activity, or malicious code is present. It strictly handles file reading and package configuration without any suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
