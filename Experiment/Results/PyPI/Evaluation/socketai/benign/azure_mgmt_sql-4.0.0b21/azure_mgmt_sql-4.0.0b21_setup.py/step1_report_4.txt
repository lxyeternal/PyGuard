{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing a Python library related to Azure SQL Management.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from version.py or _version.py, reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files for descriptions, and static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or system modifications, no data leaks, no injection points.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from files, uses static package data, and passes this data to setuptools for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors. The version extraction via regex from files is standard. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup procedures for a Python package. It reads version information from local files, reads documentation files, and calls setuptools.setup() with static, well-defined parameters. No user input, environment variables, or network interactions are involved. The pattern of reading version info is common and does not involve risky code execution. All data used in setup is either hardcoded, read from local files, or statically defined. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard configuration tasks without involving untrusted data or executing code in an unsafe manner.",
