  "purpose": "This script configures the packaging and distribution setup for the 'azure-mgmt-sql' Python library, including version extraction, metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from a version.py or _version.py file, reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files, and gathers package files via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is directly used in sensitive operations. The version string is extracted from a file, and no user input is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "File existence check and reading version.py or _version.py -> regex search for version string -> setup parameters using read data -> package discovery and dependency specification.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected. The script performs standard package setup operations with proper handling of files and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup routines, including dynamic version extraction from a file, reading markdown documentation files, and configuring package metadata. It uses safe file operations, regex for version parsing, and standard setuptools functions. No hardcoded secrets, external data injections, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a typical setup configuration for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. All operations are standard and safe.",
