  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for testing Azure SQL resource management. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The minor security concern relates to hardcoded test credentials and fixed IP addresses, which are acceptable in testing but should be replaced with secure, environment-based secrets in production."
