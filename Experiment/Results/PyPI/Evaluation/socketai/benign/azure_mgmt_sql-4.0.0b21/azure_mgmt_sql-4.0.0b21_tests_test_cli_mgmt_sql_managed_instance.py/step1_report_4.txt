{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for managing Azure SQL Managed Instances and associated network resources, including network security groups, route tables, and virtual networks.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment variables (e.g., subscription ID), Azure resource definitions, and input parameters for resource creation and management methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve Azure management client method calls that create, update, or delete resources, and string concatenation used to construct resource IDs.",
  "flows": "Input data such as resource group names, network parameters, and credentials flow into resource creation methods, resulting in resource provisioning or deletion commands.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets (except placeholder passwords), or suspicious logic is present. The code performs legitimate Azure resource management tasks. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a structured test suite that manages Azure resources related to managed instances and network configurations. It contains commented-out sections and placeholder values for passwords and IDs, which is common in test scripts. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert communication, are observed. The resource IDs and credentials are either placeholders or typical for Azure resource management. There are no suspicious data flows or insecure practices beyond standard resource provisioning procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Azure resource management test suite with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply automates the creation, listing, and deletion of Azure SQL Managed Instances and related network components for testing purposes.",
