  "purpose": "Azure resource management and testing scripts for creating, listing, updating, and deleting managed instances and network configurations.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded credentials, resource IDs, API calls to Azure SDKs, input parameters for resource creation.",
  "sinks": "Azure management API endpoints, resource provisioning, deletion, and configuration functions.",
  "flows": "Credentials and resource parameters flow into API calls for resource management; no external data exfiltration or network connections outside Azure SDK interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded credentials ('dummylogin', 'Un53cuRE!'), placeholders, commented-out code, and test artifacts; no obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Azure management/test suite, performing resource creation, listing, and deletion. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious network activity is present. Hardcoded credentials are a security concern but typical in test scripts, not indicative of malicious intent. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are detected. The code structure is clear, and the API calls are legitimate. The security risk primarily stems from credential exposure, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure resource management and testing script with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the presence of hardcoded credentials, which should be managed securely in production environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low to moderate (~0.3) due to credential exposure.",
