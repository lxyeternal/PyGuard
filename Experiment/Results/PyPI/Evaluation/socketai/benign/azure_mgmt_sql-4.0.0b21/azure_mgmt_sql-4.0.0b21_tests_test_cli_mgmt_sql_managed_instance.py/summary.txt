  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure resource management and testing script with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the presence of hardcoded credentials, which should be managed securely in production environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low to moderate (~0.3) due to credential exposure."
