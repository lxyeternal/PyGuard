  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure SDK test suite with security concerns primarily around insecure secret management (hardcoded passwords and resource names). There is no evidence of malware, sabotage, or obfuscation. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to zero. The risk score should reflect moderate concern (~0.3), mainly due to insecure secrets, but no active malicious behavior is present."
