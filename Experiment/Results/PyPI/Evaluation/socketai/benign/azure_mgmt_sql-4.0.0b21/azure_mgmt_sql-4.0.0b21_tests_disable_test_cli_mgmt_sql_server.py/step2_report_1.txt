  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the consistency of their scores, and whether any adjustments are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a test suite for Azure SQL resource management, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.  \n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious logic, no malware.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low).  \n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code content. The high confidence (0.95) is justified.  \n- **Verdict:** **No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate Azure SDK test suite but contains hardcoded secrets, posing security risks. No malware or malicious intent detected.  \n- **Findings:** Hardcoded passwords and keys, insecure practices, but no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.6 (moderate-high).  \n- **Justification for risk score:** The presence of hardcoded secrets is a security concern but does not indicate active malicious behavior.  \n- **Verdict:** The risk score seems appropriate given the insecure credential handling.  \n- **Note:** Malware remains at 0, which is correct.  \n- **Recommendation:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 2, with embedded credentials and resource management operations, no malicious activity.  \n- **Findings:** Hardcoded secrets, insecure practices, but no malware or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3 (low-moderate).  \n- **Justification:** Slightly lower risk reflects less emphasis on security concerns but still recognizes insecure handling.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Azure resource management tests with embedded secrets, no malicious activity.  \n- **Findings:** Hardcoded secrets, insecure practices, but no malware or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low).  \n- **Justification:** Consistent with the content.  \n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to others—test code with no signs of malicious activity, but contains hardcoded secrets.  \n- **Findings:** No malware, no obfuscation, standard resource management.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Observations:\n- All reports agree that there is no malware or obfuscation.\n- The primary concern is insecure handling of secrets (hardcoded passwords and keys).\n- The risk scores reflect this concern appropriately, with the highest at 0.6 for the second report.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero, which is correct given the evidence.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0 across all reports. No active malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the presence of hardcoded secrets, the scores seem reasonable. The highest (0.6) for report 2 is justified due to insecure secret handling.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.4 (moderate), considering the insecure secrets but no active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and justified in their scoring. The main concern is insecure secret management, not malware or obfuscation. No adjustments are necessary.",
