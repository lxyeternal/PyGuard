{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for creating and configuring Schema objects for data validation purposes, primarily for testing and validation of data structures.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the function arguments 'value' and 'kargs' parameters supplied by the user when calling functions like schema(), exact_schema(), like_schema(), like(), and exact().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows to sensitive operations; the functions return Schema objects without executing or passing untrusted data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input data (values for schemas) flows into the Schema constructor during function calls. These schemas are returned for later validation but are not executed or evaluated within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward, with clear docstrings and standard library imports. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several utility functions to create Schema objects with different configurations, mainly for data validation. These functions use the 'schema' function, which creates a Schema object from the 'pytest_schema.schema' library, passing user-supplied values and parameters. The functions are purely for object creation and configuration, with no external data fetching, network access, or sensitive operations. The code appears to be standard, well-documented, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of helper functions for data validation with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply wraps Schema object creation with various configuration options. There are no indicators of supply chain attacks or security vulnerabilities within this snippet.",
