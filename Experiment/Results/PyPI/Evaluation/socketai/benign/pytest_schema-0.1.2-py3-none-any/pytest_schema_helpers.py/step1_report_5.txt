{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions to create and configure schema validation objects using the 'schema' library and 'pytest_schema.schema.Schema' for data validation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via function parameters such as 'value' and '**kargs' when calling the helper functions.",
  "sinks": "The code passes the 'value' and configuration options directly to the 'Schema' class constructor, which may process or validate data later. No direct sink of untrusted data occurs within this code snippet itself.",
  "flows": "Input data provided to functions (e.g., 'value') flows into the 'Schema' constructor, which may perform validation or processing. No malicious flow is evident; the functions are simple wrappers.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual logic. It mainly serves as helper wrappers around an existing schema validation library.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward helper functions that create instances of the 'Schema' class with different configuration options for data validation. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling that could be malicious. The only concern would be the usage of the 'Schema' class, which is external and not provided here; however, based on this code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or malicious intent. The functions are well-documented and appear to serve legitimate validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign set of helper functions for schema validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or sabotage within this snippet. The code is safe based on the information available.",
