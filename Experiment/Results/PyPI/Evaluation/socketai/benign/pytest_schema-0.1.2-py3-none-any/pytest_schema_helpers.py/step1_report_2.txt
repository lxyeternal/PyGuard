{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions to create and configure schema validation objects for data validation purposes using the 'schema' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters 'value' and '**kargs' from function calls; it also imports modules at the beginning.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior, no network or file operations, and no data leakage mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed to the 'Schema' constructor; no further processing or data flow outside validation setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard schema validation helper functions with no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines several helper functions for creating schema validation objects with different configurations. These functions merely wrap the 'Schema' class constructor from the 'schema' library, passing parameters received from arguments. No user input is processed directly for execution, nor are there any network, file, or environment variable operations. The functions serve as wrappers for configuration convenience. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious control flow. The code appears to be standard, benign utility functions with well-documented behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of helper functions for schema validation, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It poses no security risks.",
