  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Code Summary:**\n- The code defines multiple helper functions that create instances of a `Schema` class from the `pytest_schema.schema` module.\n- These functions are straightforward wrappers, configuring schema validation behavior (exact match vs. non-exact).\n- There are no dynamic code executions, no network or file operations, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code appears to be a utility layer for schema validation, not executing untrusted data or performing any malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, just wrapper functions.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no evident vulnerabilities.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — fully consistent.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, benign utility functions.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, straightforward helper functions.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, just schema creation helpers.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same benign utility functions.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher, but the reasoning is that the code is just wrappers, not executing untrusted data.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Note:** The security risk score of 0.2 might be slightly overestimating; the code itself doesn't process or execute untrusted data directly. It's just a wrapper.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify the code as clear.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the nature of the code, a risk score higher than 0.1-0.2 is unwarranted unless there's external context indicating misuse. The code itself is benign.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a set of helper functions for schema validation, with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, though the last report's risk score could be slightly lowered from 0.2 to 0.1 or 0, given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n| **0**     | **0**       | **0.0** |\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious activity detected.  \n- No obfuscation present.  \n- The code is a benign utility layer for schema validation, not executing or handling untrusted data maliciously.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation, and the risk score can be confidently set to zero.",
