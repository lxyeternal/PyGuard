{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions to create and configure schema validation objects for data validation, wrapping the Schema class from an external library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters 'value' and '**kargs' in function calls, and imports modules 'Any', 'List', and 'Or' from 'typing' and 'schema', and 'Schema' from 'pytest_schema.schema'.",
  "sinks": "The functions return instances of the 'Schema' class; these objects could be used elsewhere to validate data, but there are no direct sinks like network or file operations in this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed into functions and used to instantiate 'Schema' objects, which may be used in validation flows elsewhere; no dangerous data flows are evident within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns are present. The code only defines helper functions wrapping an external library.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing modules and an external 'schema' library, then defines multiple helper functions that create 'Schema' instances with specific configurations. All functions are straightforward wrappers with no dynamic code execution, no untrusted input processing beyond parameter passing, and no network or system commands. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The functions simply facilitate schema validation setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign and solely focused on providing helper functions for schema validation using an external library. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
