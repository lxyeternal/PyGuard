{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions to create and configure instances of a Schema class for data validation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data in function arguments for validation (value, kargs) and creates Schema objects.",
  "sinks": "The Schema constructor could be a sink if it processes untrusted data; however, it is a known data validation library, not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed to helper functions, which then instantiate Schema objects with specific configurations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code solely provides wrapper functions for a schema validation library.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions that wrap the creation of Schema objects from the 'pytest_schema.schema' module. These functions differ only in schema configuration parameters (e.g., exact matching, ignoring extra keys). There is no dynamic execution, code injection, network activity, or file manipulation. The functions do not perform any data processing beyond passing parameters to the Schema constructor. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present; the code appears to be straightforward helper functions for schema validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for schema validation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It solely interacts with an imported library to facilitate data validation tasks. No malware, backdoors, or security threats are present.",
