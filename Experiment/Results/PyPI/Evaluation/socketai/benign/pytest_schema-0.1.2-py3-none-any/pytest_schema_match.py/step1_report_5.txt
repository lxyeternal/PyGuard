{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator to modify the behavior of class methods related to schema validation, specifically toggling a validation flag.",
  "sources": "The code reads the class attribute 'self._ignore_extra_keys' and the method 'f' passed to the decorator.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly write untrusted data to external systems or leak data. It manipulates internal class state and calls a method.",
  "flows": "The decorator temporarily changes 'self._ignore_extra_keys' based on 'exact', calls the wrapped method 'f', then restores the original value.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code relies on class attributes and function calls without external data sources or sinks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that toggles an internal class attribute '_ignore_extra_keys' before and after executing a wrapped method, then returns the boolean result of that method call. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code's structure is straightforward, focusing on managing validation behavior. No obfuscated code, no suspicious external interactions, and no anomalous logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for schema validation control, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
