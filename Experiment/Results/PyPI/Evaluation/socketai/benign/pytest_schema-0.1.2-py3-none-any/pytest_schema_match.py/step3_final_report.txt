{
  "purpose": "A decorator factory to toggle the '_ignore_extra_keys' attribute in a class for validation purposes, allowing strict or non-strict schema validation modes.",
  "sources": "The method receives 'self' (the class instance) and 'value' (input data) as parameters; it reads and temporarily modifies 'self._ignore_extra_keys'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, perform network calls, or leak data; it only modifies internal class state and calls a method.",
  "flows": "Source: reading 'self._ignore_extra_keys'; flow: toggling its value; sink: calling the wrapped method 'f(self, value)'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with proper state restoration via try-finally; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator factory 'match' that creates a decorator '_decorator'. This decorator wraps a class method, temporarily toggling the internal attribute '_ignore_extra_keys' based on the 'exact' parameter, then restoring it after execution. It ensures internal validation mode is set appropriately during the method call. The code is simple, uses standard Python practices, and does not perform any external actions or data leaks. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign internal utility for toggling validation modes within a class. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The analysis confirms that the code is safe, and the scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with its behavior.",
