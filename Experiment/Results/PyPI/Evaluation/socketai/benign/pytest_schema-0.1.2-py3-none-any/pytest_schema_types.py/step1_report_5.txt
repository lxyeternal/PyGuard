{
  "purpose": "Define a module that exports specific schema validation classes, primarily re-exporting components from the 'schema' library.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'schema' module, the module's own __all__ list, and the Enum class definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no functions or methods accepting external input or performing output.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only defines class and list structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The class 'Enum' extends 'Or' with planned future features, but currently contains only a placeholder docstring and no executable code beyond inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from the 'schema' library, defines an __all__ list for module exports, and declares an 'Enum' class extending 'Or'. The 'Enum' class appears to be a placeholder for future enhancements, with comments indicating intended support for Enum-like workflows. There are no operations, data processing, or untrusted input handling present. No malicious or obfuscated code, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup that re-exports classes and defines a placeholder class intended for future expansion. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
