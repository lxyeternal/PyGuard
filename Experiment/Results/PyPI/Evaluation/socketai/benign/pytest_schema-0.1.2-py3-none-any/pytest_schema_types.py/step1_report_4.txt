  "purpose": "Define and export schema validation classes and interfaces for use in data validation.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'schema' library; __all__ list defining exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data processing or external output identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive functions or output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The class 'Enum' extends 'Or' without malicious intent, merely extending or patching its interface.",
  "analysis": "The code imports validation components from the 'schema' library, defines an __all__ list for exports, and creates an 'Enum' class extending 'Or' with planned support for enum-like workflows. There are no signs of malicious logic, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be standard setup for schema validation purposes, with comments indicating future feature support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It serves as part of a schema validation setup, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
