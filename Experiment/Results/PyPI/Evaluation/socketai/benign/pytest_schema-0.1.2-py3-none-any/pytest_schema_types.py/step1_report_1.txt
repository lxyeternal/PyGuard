{
  "purpose": "This code defines imports and exports for schema validation components, including an Enum class extending Or.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'schema' module; class definition within the same file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code mainly defines classes and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The Enum class is a simple extension without complex logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several components from the 'schema' library and re-exports them, indicating a modular design for schema validation. The Enum class extends Or with an internal comment about future expansion; it currently does not add any malicious behavior or complex logic. There are no data processing, input handling, or network operations present. The code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module setup for schema validation, with a basic class extension and no suspicious or malicious activity detected. It poses no security threat.",
