{
  "purpose": "Defines a schema validation utility with a placeholder Enum class for future expansion.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'schema' library, class definition with comments, no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code contains only class and import declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Class 'Enum' contains only comments about future plans; no executable code or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module importing schema components, exporting them via __all__, and defining a subclass 'Enum' with placeholder comments. No data processing, input handling, or malicious activity is present. The class is a non-functional placeholder, indicating no current security issues or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The placeholder class 'Enum' does not introduce vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
