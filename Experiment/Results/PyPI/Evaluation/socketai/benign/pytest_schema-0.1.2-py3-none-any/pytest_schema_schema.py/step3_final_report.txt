{
  "purpose": "Extension of a schema validation class to facilitate comparison operations for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters to validate against schemas, primarily within validation and comparison methods.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not write or transmit data outside its scope.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated via internal methods; no external data flows or network operations are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Decorators from 'match' are used for validation, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign extension of a schema validation class, adding comparison operators and matching methods for testing. It relies on external libraries but does not perform any network, file, or system operations. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The validation functions are standard, and the code is straightforward and readable. The only minor concern is a very slight security risk score in one report (0.1), which is marginal and not indicative of actual malicious activity. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign extension used for testing schema validation with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score is acceptable and does not reflect any real threat.",
