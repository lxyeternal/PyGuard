{
  "purpose": "The code defines an extension of a schema validation class to facilitate assertions in tests, providing custom comparison methods.",
  "sources": "No external data sources, input, or untrusted data reads are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No output, data leaks, or sensitive information handling occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the methods only perform validation against provided data.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward extension of schema validation with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports external libraries (schema, pytest_schema.match) but does not execute any external or network operations. The class extends a base schema validator, adding comparison methods for testing purposes, which rely on standard validation methods. The methods include custom equality comparisons and annotations for exact or partial matching. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are identified. No data leaks, credential management, or system access manipulations are evident. The overall structure is standard for test helpers, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign extension of schema validation logic intended for testing. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply adds convenient comparison operators for validation purposes.",
