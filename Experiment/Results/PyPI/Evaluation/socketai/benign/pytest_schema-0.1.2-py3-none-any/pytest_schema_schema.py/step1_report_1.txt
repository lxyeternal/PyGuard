{
  "purpose": "This code defines an extension of a schema validation class to facilitate assertions in testing scenarios, allowing for exact and approximate schema matches.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters to validation methods and class attributes. No external or untrusted data sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to external systems, network, files, or sensitive data. Validation results are returned as booleans; no data leakage or external effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed to validation methods (__eq__, __ne__, exact, not_exact, like, not_like), which invoke internal validation functions. No flow to external sinks or outputs is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The class mainly provides validation logic with decorators, but no code injection, network access, or data exfiltration behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code extends a schema validation class, adding comparison operators (__eq__, __ne__, etc.) with matching decorators to facilitate test assertions. It uses external libraries (schema, pytest_schema.match), which are common and not suspicious. No external data sources or sinks are used; validation is purely internal. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic such as network activity, file operations, or credential handling is present. The code appears to serve a benign purpose related to testing schema validation, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of schema validation for testing purposes, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and contains no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
