{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports specific functions and classes from the 'pytest_schema' library and re-exports them via the __all__ list, acting as an API facade or namespace aggregator.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'pytest_schema' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only performs static imports and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module that imports symbols from an external library and re-exports them. It contains no data processing, no user input handling, no network communication, and no dynamic code execution. The code is clear, simple, and standard for defining module interfaces. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The confidence level of 1 is justified given the straightforward analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk. It poses no threat to supply chain security and is a standard, safe module pattern.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
