  "purpose": "Initialization and configuration setup for the Theano library, including logging, environment validation, and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, module imports, configuration parameters, and input variables within utility functions.",
  "sinks": "No external network interactions, file writes, or untrusted data outputs detected.",
  "flows": "Input environment variables and configuration parameters influence logging levels and environment checks; utility functions operate on symbolic variables without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors identified. No obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard library setup routines, environment validation, and utility function definitions typical for a scientific computing library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are evident. Environment path checks in Python 3 are standard practice. Scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard initialization script for the Theano library, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1).",
