{
  "purpose": "Implements a conditional 'IfElse' operation in Theano for lazy evaluation, supporting multiple tensors on each branch, with associated shape inference, gradient, and optimization routines.",
  "sources": "Reads input tensors, condition scalar, and internal graph nodes during shape inference, gradient computation, and thunk execution.",
  "sinks": "Accesses 'storage_map' during thunk execution to retrieve tensor values; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs through graph nodes, 'storage_map' during execution, and outputs, following standard Theano graph evaluation patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation. Presence of debug print statements ('print('here')') in optimization routines is a development artifact, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of a conditional operation in Theano, with associated graph optimization routines. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident. Use of 'deepcopy', 'zeros_like', and tensor copying is typical in symbolic graph management. Debug print statements are benign artifacts. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a conditional tensor operation in Theano, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor risk score reflects typical development artifacts rather than security concerns.",
