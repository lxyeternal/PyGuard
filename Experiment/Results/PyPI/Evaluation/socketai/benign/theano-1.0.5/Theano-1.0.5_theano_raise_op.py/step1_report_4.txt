{
  "purpose": "Defines a Theano symbolic operation that raises an exception during execution.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'x' in make_node() method.",
  "sinks": "perform() method raises an exception based on provided message and exception class.",
  "flows": "Input 'x' -> make_node() -> perform() -> raises exception based on 'self.exc' and 'self.msg'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard Python exception raising pattern, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Raise' that inherits from a Theano operation (gof.Op). It is designed to raise an exception when perform() is called, with configurable message and exception type. The class appears to serve a debugging or testing purpose within the symbolic computation graph. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code patterns are present. It solely raises exceptions as intended, with no external network activity, data leakage, or backdoors. Usage of standard Python exception mechanisms suggests no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility class for raising exceptions within a Theano symbolic graph, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
