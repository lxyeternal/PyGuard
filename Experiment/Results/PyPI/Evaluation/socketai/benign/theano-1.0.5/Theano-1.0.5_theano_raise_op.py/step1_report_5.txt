{
  "purpose": "Define a Theano operation that raises an exception with a customizable message and exception type.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the class takes parameters during initialization and the perform() method is called with internal inputs.",
  "sinks": "The perform() method raises an exception, which could potentially disrupt or halt execution if invoked improperly.",
  "flows": "Input x is passed to make_node, which creates a node. When perform() is called, it raises the specified exception with a message.",
  "anomalies": "The code simply raises an exception; there are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that subclasses gof.Op. The constructor sets up a message and exception type. make_node creates a node for computation. perform() raises the specified exception, which is a normal behavior for an operation designed to do so. There are no external data sources, network calls, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and intended for controlled exception raising within Theano computations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class for intentionally raising exceptions within Theano. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is clear, and it does not perform any harmful operations.",
