  "purpose": "Utility functions for visualization and debugging of Theano graphs, including graph printing, variable description, and visualization via pydot.",
  "sources": "Variable attributes, owner references, profile data, and external libraries (numpy, six, theano, pydot).",
  "sinks": "Print statements, generated image files, string representations, and hashes for variable identification.",
  "flows": "Data flows from variables and nodes into print outputs, files, and images; external process calls invoke Graphviz via pydot.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. External calls are standard for visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of visualization and debugging utilities relying on standard libraries. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. External process invocation (g.write) is typical for graph rendering and appears controlled. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility suite for visualization and debugging of Theano graphs. No malicious intent or obfuscation present. External process calls are standard and managed safely. The risk score reflects minimal external invocation risk. Overall, the scores are justified and accurate.",
