  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard setup script for the 'Theano' package.\n- No report mentions or indicates any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code reads static description files, uses versioneer for version management with fallback parsing, and calls setup() with standard parameters.\n- The code does not perform any network operations, execute untrusted code, or handle user input.\n- The only noteworthy behavior is fallback version parsing from a local file, which is a common pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **No issues are present in the code.** All described behaviors are typical for a setup script.\n\n### Flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n- The reports do not identify any logical errors or security flaws.\n- The fallback version parsing is straightforward and safe.\n- The code relies on local files for description and version info, which is standard.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0.0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0.1 or 0.0, reflecting minimal or no security risk.\n\n**Suggestion:** The risk scores are reasonable; since there's no malicious activity, a score of 0.0 or 0.1 is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign such high scores; all are consistent with the benign nature of the script.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent with their assessments.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately low.\n- The risk scores are also appropriate, given the benign behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the detailed review, I conclude:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 to 0.1 (minimal to no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The use of fallback version parsing is standard and safe.\n- The script does not contain any code that could be exploited or used maliciously.\n- No suspicious external data sources or code execution patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThis setup script is a typical, benign Python package configuration. It performs standard operations with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed analysis above.",
