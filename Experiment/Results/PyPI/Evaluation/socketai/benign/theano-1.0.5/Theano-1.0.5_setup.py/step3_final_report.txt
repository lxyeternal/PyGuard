{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'Theano' Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads description files ('DESCRIPTION.txt', 'NEWS.txt'), version info via 'versioneer', and local files for fallback version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external network activity, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Reads static files for description and version; no external data flow or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fallback version parsing from local file is typical; no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script with standard practices. It reads static description files, retrieves version info via 'versioneer' with a fallback mechanism, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The fallback version parsing involves reading a local file, which is a common pattern. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, benign package setup configuration with no malicious or obfuscated code. The low security risk score accurately reflects its safe, standard operations.",
