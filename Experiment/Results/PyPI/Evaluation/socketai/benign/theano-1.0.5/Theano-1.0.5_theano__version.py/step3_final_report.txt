  "purpose": "Load static version information from a predefined JSON string.",
  "sources": "The hardcoded JSON string 'version_json' within the script.",
  "sinks": "The json.loads() function parsing the static JSON data.",
  "flows": "The static JSON string is passed directly to json.loads() and returned as a Python dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, external inputs, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the json module, defines a static JSON string containing version metadata, and provides a function get_versions() that parses and returns this data. There are no external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The JSON data appears to be generated by 'versioneer.py', a standard version management tool. The code is minimal, clear, and typical for version info embedding. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The static nature and simplicity indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version information loader with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe and straightforward nature. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
