{
  "purpose": "The code generates version information for a project, likely used for tracking and display purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads a hardcoded JSON string assigned to 'version_json'.",
  "sinks": "The 'json.loads' function parses the JSON string into a Python dictionary.",
  "flows": "The 'get_versions' function loads and returns the JSON data from 'version_json'.",
  "anomalies": "The JSON data is hardcoded, which is typical; no dynamic or external input sources are present. No suspicious code, obfuscated parts, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'json' library and defines a static JSON string with version metadata. The 'get_versions' function parses this string into a Python dictionary. The code appears to be a standard way to embed version info in a package. No external inputs, environment variables, or network activity are involved. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and intended for version info management. There are no indications of malware, security risks, or obfuscation.",
