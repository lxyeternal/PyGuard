{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a generated script that loads version information from a JSON string, likely used for version tracking or metadata purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'version_json' string defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "The code parses 'version_json' with json.loads, which is a safe operation; no untrusted input sources or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The data flow is straightforward: the hardcoded JSON string is parsed into a Python dictionary and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious behavior detected. The JSON is static, hardcoded data, not dynamically retrieved or influenced by external input.",
  "analysis": "The script is simple and contains only static data defining version information. It uses standard Python libraries and patterns without external inputs or outputs. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The code is a typical version info loader generated by a versioning tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security issues. It functions solely to provide version metadata, with no external input, output, or potential attack vectors.",
