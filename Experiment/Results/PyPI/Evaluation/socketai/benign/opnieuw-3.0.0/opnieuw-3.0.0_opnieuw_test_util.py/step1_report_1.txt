{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom backoff calculator that disables delays between retries and provides a context manager to replace the existing backoff mechanism with this custom version, facilitating immediate retries in specific contexts.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules (`__future__`, `contextlib`, and local `.retries`) and function parameters (`namespace`).",
  "sinks": "None of the functions or code sections directly write to or send data over the network, disk, or other channels.",
  "flows": "The `retry_immediately` function calls `replace_backoff_calculator` to replace the backoff logic with `WaitLessBackoff`, which manages retry timing based on internal state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. The custom backoff simply returns zero delay, which may be used to accelerate retries but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code introduces a subclass `WaitLessBackoff` that overrides `get_backoff` to always return 0 (immediate retry) until a maximum call count is reached, at which point it returns `None`. The function `retry_immediately` allows replacing the current backoff calculator with this custom implementation, potentially speeding up retries. The logic is straightforward and appears to serve a legitimate purpose, such as speeding up retries in a controlled environment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data theft, or hidden functionalities. The code's structure is standard, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a controlled mechanism for immediate retries by replacing backoff logic. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. Its primary purpose seems to be to disable wait times between retries, which could be used for testing or to improve performance in specific scenarios.",
