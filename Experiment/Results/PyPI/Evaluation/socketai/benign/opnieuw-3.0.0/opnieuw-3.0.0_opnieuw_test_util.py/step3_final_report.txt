{
  "purpose": "Defines a backoff class that disables retry delays by returning zero until a maximum number of retries, and provides a function to replace the backoff calculator with this class for immediate retries.",
  "sources": "The get_backoff method within WaitLessBackoff class, the replace_backoff_calculator function call in retry_immediately",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects; the code only modifies retry timing behavior internally",
  "flows": "The retry_immediately function replaces the existing backoff calculator with WaitLessBackoff, affecting subsequent retry behavior",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass that overrides get_backoff to return 0 (immediate retry) until max_calls_total is reached, then None. The retry_immediately function replaces the current backoff calculator with this class, effectively disabling wait times between retries. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logic is clear and intended for testing or performance tuning. Potential misuse exists if used maliciously to overload systems, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility to disable retry delays, likely for testing or performance purposes. No malicious activity or malware is detected. The potential for misuse warrants a low to moderate security risk score, but overall, it is safe if used responsibly.",
