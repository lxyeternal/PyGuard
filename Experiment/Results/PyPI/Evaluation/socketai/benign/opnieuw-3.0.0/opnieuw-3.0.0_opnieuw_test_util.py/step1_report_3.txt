{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom backoff calculator that minimizes wait times during retries and provides a context manager to enforce this behavior for retry decorators.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own imports, class attributes such as 'backoffs' and 'max_calls_total', and the function parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is used to cause data leaks, code injection, or other vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The function 'retry_immediately' calls 'replace_backoff_calculator' to replace the backoff strategy with 'WaitLessBackoff', which then manages retry behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no unusual or suspicious code patterns. It does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'WaitLessBackoff' that overrides 'get_backoff' to return zero delay until a maximum number of retries is reached, preventing wait times. The function 'retry_immediately' provides a context manager to apply this backoff strategy globally or within a specified namespace. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is clean, intended for retry logic customization, and does not exhibit suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a retry strategy that minimizes delays between retries. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation appears legitimate and focused on retry management.",
