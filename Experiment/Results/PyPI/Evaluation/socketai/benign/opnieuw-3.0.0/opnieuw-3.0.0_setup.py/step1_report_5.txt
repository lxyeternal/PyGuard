  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the 'opnieuw' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setuptools; package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the setup script uses static data and configuration values only.",
  "flows": "N/A - no untrusted data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard setup script with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, reads a markdown file for description, defines package metadata, and calls setuptools.setup with static values. All data used are hardcoded or read from files, with no user input or external data sources involved. No code injection, malicious network activity, or obfuscation observed. The code appears to follow typical packaging conventions without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup configuration script with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It performs typical package setup tasks securely.",
