  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no unusual behaviors. Usage of a standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools for package setup, reads a README file for long description, sets package metadata including version, author, and license, and specifies dependencies with conditions. No code injection, external network calls, or sensitive data handling is present. The code follows standard practices for Python package setup without suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
