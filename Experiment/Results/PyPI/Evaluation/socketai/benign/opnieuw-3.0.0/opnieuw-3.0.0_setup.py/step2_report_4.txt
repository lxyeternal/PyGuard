  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the accuracy of their findings and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Python setup script.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected.\n- The only external input is the 'README.md' file, which is typical.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted data sources is present.\n- The code uses standard practices for package configuration.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the purpose and sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks; data flows are straightforward.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies; standard setup script.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly concludes no malicious activity; confidence is 1.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected. **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the purpose.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data sinks; data flows are benign.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard packaging code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No concerns. **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- Same as above, consistent and correct.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, correctly identifies the script as standard.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- Same consistent findings.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a benign, standard setup script.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified and reasonable.\n- No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present.\n- The code does not contain any hidden or malicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at **0**, given the absence of any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a typical, well-formed Python package setup script with no malicious or security-threatening elements. The reports are accurate and consistent, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nAll assessments are aligned with the evidence.",
