{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'opnieuw' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external effect beyond setup.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file read ('README.md') to 'long_description' variable, used in package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard setup script with no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No untrusted input handling, no network activity, and no suspicious code logic. The only external input is the 'README.md' file, which is typical. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks detected. It contains no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
