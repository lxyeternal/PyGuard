  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'opnieuw', including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; no other input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data or input could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Standard setup.py structure with no suspicious code, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily loads a README file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for setuptools. It uses standard practices for Python packaging with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. The only input is the README file, which is a typical practice. The dependencies are version-restricted but benign. No code executes dynamically or reads sensitive environment variables. The overall structure is clean and typical for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
