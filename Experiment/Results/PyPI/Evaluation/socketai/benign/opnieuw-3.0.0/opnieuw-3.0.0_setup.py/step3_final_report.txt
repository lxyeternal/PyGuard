{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging the 'opnieuw' library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data without executing any dynamic or external code.",
  "sources": "Reading the local 'README.md' file for long description; static package configuration data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Reading local file -> assigning to variable -> passing static data to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no external network calls, no secrets or credentials.",
  "analysis": "The script imports only standard libraries, reads a local markdown file, and calls setuptools.setup() with static parameters. No untrusted input, no code obfuscation, no malicious patterns. All data flows are straightforward and limited to local files and static configuration. The code follows common packaging practices and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The supply chain risk for this package, based on the provided code, is negligible.",
