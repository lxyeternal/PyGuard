{
  "purpose": "This code provides unit tests for retry mechanisms, backoff calculations, and clock handling in the 'nieuw' module, specifically testing retry logic, exception handling, and timing functions.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (random, time, unittest, mock), and functions/classes from opnieuw.clock, opnieuw.retries, and opnieuw.test_util.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that lead to data leaks, external communication, or system modification. The code only raises exceptions and performs in-memory testing.",
  "flows": "Code flow involves calling retry-decorated methods, handling exceptions, and mocking random values to test retry timing and exception chaining within controlled unit tests. No untrusted input is processed, and there are no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code strictly implements test logic for retry mechanisms with no unusual or obfuscated code. Usage of mock and timing controls appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests designed to validate the behavior of retry logic and clock management in a controlled environment. It uses mocking for randomness and time to simulate retries and delays, with no external data sources or network activity. No suspicious code patterns, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The functions test exception handling, timing, and retry limits, all within a testing framework. The overall structure is typical for test code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely a test suite for retry mechanisms and does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not interact with external systems, handle sensitive data, or include obfuscated or suspicious code. It appears to be a standard, legitimate testing module with no security concerns.",
