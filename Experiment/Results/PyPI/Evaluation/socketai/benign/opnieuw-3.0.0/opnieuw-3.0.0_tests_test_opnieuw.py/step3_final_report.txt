{
  "purpose": "The code is a suite of unit tests for retry mechanisms, backoff calculations, clock handling, and exception propagation within a retry library.",
  "sources": "Input sources include method calls that raise exceptions, mock objects for randomness and clock manipulation, and internal function calls within test cases.",
  "sinks": "There are no external data flows, network communications, or system modifications; exception handling is confined within test functions.",
  "flows": "Sources (exception raises, mocks) lead to retry logic execution, which may invoke backoff calculations and exception chaining, but all within a controlled test environment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code follows standard testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests for retry logic, utilizing mocks and exception raising to verify behavior. No external data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation are detected. The code's purpose is to validate retry mechanisms, and it does not perform any harmful operations or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for retry functionality, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate safe, standard testing code.",
