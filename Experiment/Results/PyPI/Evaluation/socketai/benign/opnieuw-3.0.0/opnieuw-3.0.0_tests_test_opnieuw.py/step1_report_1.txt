{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for retry mechanisms, backoff calculators, and clock handling related to resilient function execution.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method calls, exceptions raised within test functions, and mock objects for randomness and timing.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include exception handling and test assertions. No data output, network communication, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Flow involves raising exceptions within retry-decorated methods, which are caught and handled by retry logic. Mocked random values influence sleep intervals during retries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of mock objects and controlled exception raising appears consistent with testing frameworks. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a set of unit tests for retry logic using decorators, mock clocks, and randomness. It uses standard Python modules and testing practices. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior are evident. All functions and classes serve to test retry behavior and exception propagation under controlled conditions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for retry mechanisms without malicious intent. It does not contain malware or security risks. The overall security profile is benign, focusing on verifying retry logic robustness.",
