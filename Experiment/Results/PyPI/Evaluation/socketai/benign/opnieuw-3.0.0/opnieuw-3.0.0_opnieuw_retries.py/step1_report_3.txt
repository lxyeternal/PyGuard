{
  "purpose": "This code implements a retry mechanism with exponential backoff and jitter, intended to retry functions upon specific exceptions within a defined time window, for both synchronous and asynchronous functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the following sources: environment variables (via sys and typing_extensions imports), system time (clock), random number generator (random.uniform), and function input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include time.sleep() and asyncio.sleep(), which can delay execution. No direct data leaks, network communication, or file modifications are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling a decorated function, catching exceptions, calculating backoff time using BackoffCalculator, and retrying until success or retry limit is reached.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses contextvars to manage backoff calculator state, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code paths, or unusual behaviors are observed. No obfuscated code, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard retry with exponential backoff pattern, using a configurable maximum number of calls and a retry window. It includes functions for calculating backoff periods, manages state via context variables, and supports both sync and async functions. No signs of malicious activity, such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors, are detected. Usage of random.uniform introduces jitter, which is normal for backoff strategies. All dependencies are standard libraries or well-known modules, and no suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a retry mechanism with exponential backoff and jitter, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious behaviors. It is a typical pattern used in network or I/O operations to handle transient failures.",
