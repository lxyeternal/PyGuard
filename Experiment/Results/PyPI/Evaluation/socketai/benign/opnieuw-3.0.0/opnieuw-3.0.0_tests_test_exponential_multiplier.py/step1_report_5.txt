  "purpose": "Unit testing for the calculate_exponential_multiplier function in the 'opnieuw.retries' module.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the function calculate_exponential_multiplier, specifically the max_calls_total and base multiplier value (120).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted data or could cause data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to the function are used to compute a multiplier; no external data or network flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "This code performs unit testing using the unittest framework. It tests the function calculate_exponential_multiplier with specific input values and checks for expected outputs. There are no external data sources, no data sinks, and no complex control flows. The code is well-structured, typical for test cases, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test script for a function, with no signs of malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It does not interact with untrusted data or external systems.",
