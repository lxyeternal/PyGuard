  "purpose": "Unit testing the function calculate_exponential_multiplier with fixed input values to verify its correctness.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; input values are hardcoded within test cases.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks; no external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input parameters in test cases are passed directly to the function; no complex data flows or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard unit test without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard unit test script for a mathematical function, with fixed inputs and expected outputs. It imports only standard modules and the target function, performs assertions, and runs under __main__. No external data, network activity, or malicious code is present. The test is benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent and appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard unit test with no malicious or security concerns. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and justified. No modifications or further scrutiny are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
