  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'calculate_exponential_multiplier' function in the 'retries' module of the 'opnieuw' package.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'unittest' and 'opnieuw.retries', specifically the 'calculate_exponential_multiplier' function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data affects security; test code uses fixed input values.",
  "flows": "Input values (constants) are passed directly to the function; no flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward test code with standard unittest structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test class with a single test method that tests the 'calculate_exponential_multiplier' function with fixed input values. It performs assertions to verify expected outputs for specific inputs. The code relies on standard libraries and imports a function from a local package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be normal test code for validating functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical unit testing script for a specific function, with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It does not process untrusted input or perform any harmful operations.",
