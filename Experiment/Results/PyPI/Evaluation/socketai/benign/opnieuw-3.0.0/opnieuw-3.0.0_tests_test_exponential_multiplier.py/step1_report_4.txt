  "purpose": "The code defines unit tests for the function calculate_exponential_multiplier, which calculates an exponential multiplier based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters 'max_calls_total' and 'base_multiplier' passed to calculate_exponential_multiplier.",
  "sinks": "Uses assertEqual to verify expected output, which is benign and typical in testing scenarios.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to calculate_exponential_multiplier, output compared via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded test values are used for verification. No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard unit testing module, importing 'unittest' and testing a specific function. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or external data flows. It appears to be a straightforward test suite verifying the behavior of a calculation function.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. It is designed for testing a calculation function and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
