  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'calculate_exponential_multiplier' function in the 'retries' module of the 'opnieuw' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'unittest' and 'calculate_exponential_multiplier', function calls within the test case.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data inputs or outputs are present in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A - test functions invoke the target function directly with constant parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be standard test code with no suspicious or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit testing script that tests the behavior of a function related to exponential calculation. It imports the necessary modules, defines a test class with a test method, and runs the tests if executed as the main program. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or external data handling. All function calls are with fixed, known parameters. No hidden backdoors, network activity, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit testing script for a specific function with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
