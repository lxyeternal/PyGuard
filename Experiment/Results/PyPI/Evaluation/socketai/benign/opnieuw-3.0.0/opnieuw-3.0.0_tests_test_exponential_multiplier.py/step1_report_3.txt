  "purpose": "Unit tests for the calculate_exponential_multiplier function in the opnieuw.retries module.",
  "sources": "Import of the unittest module and the function calculate_exponential_multiplier from opnieuw.retries.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external output handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only performs internal tests without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code appears to be standard unit testing with hardcoded expected values.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the unittest framework and a specific function from a module. It defines a test case class that tests the behavior of calculate_exponential_multiplier with specific inputs, verifying expected outputs. The tests are straightforward and do not involve any data input from untrusted sources or external systems. The code appears to be a typical unit testing script with no suspicious or malicious patterns. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated sections. It performs a simple calculation validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit testing script for a function, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It serves the purpose of verifying correct behavior of a calculator function in a safe manner.",
