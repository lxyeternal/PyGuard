  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nThe provided code is a minimal module that imports retry-related functions and an exception class from local modules (`.exceptions` and `.retries`) and exposes them via `__all__`. It contains only import statements, a license comment, and an `__all__` declaration. There are no data processing, external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Security Risks**  \nAll reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. The code does not handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. It simply re-exports functions and classes for use elsewhere.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**  \nThere are no logical errors or flaws in the code. The code’s purpose is clear, and it is implemented correctly for its intended role as a module export.\n\n4. **Scores and Their Justification**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No malicious activity is present.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct since the code is straightforward and human-readable.  \n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code does not introduce any security risks.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores**  \nThe scores seem consistent with the code and analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**  \nGiven the code and the detailed reports, I concur that the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores (1.0) are justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis module is a standard, safe API setup for retry functionality. No security concerns or malicious intent are evident.",
