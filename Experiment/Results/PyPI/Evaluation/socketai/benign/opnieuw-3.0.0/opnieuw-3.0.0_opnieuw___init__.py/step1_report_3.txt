{
  "purpose": "This module appears to define and expose retry mechanisms and an exception class for handling retries in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.exceptions and .retries), module-level __all__ declaration.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or untrusted external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules and declares __all__ for export. It is a typical module setup for exposing functionality. No dynamic code execution, no input reading, and no handling of untrusted data. No obfuscated code or signs of malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup for retry mechanisms, with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
