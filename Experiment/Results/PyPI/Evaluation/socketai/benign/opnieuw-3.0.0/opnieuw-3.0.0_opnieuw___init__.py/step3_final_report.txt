{
  "purpose": "A minimal Python module that imports retry-related functions and an exception class from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from .exceptions and .retries modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external data handling, or network activity",
  "flows": "Import statements to __all__ declaration; no data flow beyond module setup",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export pattern, no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that re-exports specific functions and classes for use elsewhere. It contains only import statements and a declaration of __all__, with no dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions. All reviews correctly identify the benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are accurate and should remain as-is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
