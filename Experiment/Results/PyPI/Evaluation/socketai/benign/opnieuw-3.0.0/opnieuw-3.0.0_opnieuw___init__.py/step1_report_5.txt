  "purpose": "Export retry mechanisms and exception class related to retry logic, for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules '.exceptions' and '.retries'. No input or external data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only module imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use. There are no embedded data reads, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior. It appears to be a simple module definition for retry utilities and exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module setup with no malicious or security concerns detected. It simply manages exports for retry functionality and exception handling.",
