  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple module that imports retry functions and exceptions from local modules and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data handling, external network activity, or obfuscation.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The purpose across reports is consistent: providing retry mechanisms and exceptions as a public API.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Code presence and correctness:**\n   - The code matches the description: it imports `RetryException`, `retry`, and `retry_async` from local modules and exposes them via `__all__`.\n   - No anomalies, no suspicious patterns, no signs of malicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no logical errors or security flaws.\n   - The import statements are standard, and the `__all__` declaration is correct.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - All reports give a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which is consistent with the benign analysis.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is simple and benign, there is no justification for higher risk, malware, or obfuscated scores.\n\n5. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is just a module setup with no external data handling or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the evidence, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a standard, benign module for re-exporting retry functions and exceptions.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.",
