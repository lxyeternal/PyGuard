  "purpose": "This module provides retry mechanisms and a custom exception for handling retries in code.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .exceptions and .retries",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths; only imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export statements",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions related to retry logic from local modules and exposes them via __all__ for external use. There are no dynamic code executions, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code is minimal and typical for a Python package module defining exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard module definition for retry functionality. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
