  "purpose": "Provides retry mechanisms and a custom exception for retry logic in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.exceptions, .retries).",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is written to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or execution flow that involves untrusted input is visible.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from internal modules, then exposes them via __all__ for public API. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. No external network activity, data handling, or security-sensitive operations are present. The comments indicate license information but do not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code functions as a simple API interface for retry logic without any security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export file, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply re-exports functions and exceptions related to retry mechanisms.",
