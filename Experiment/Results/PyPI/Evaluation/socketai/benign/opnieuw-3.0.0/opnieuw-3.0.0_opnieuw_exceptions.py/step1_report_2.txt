  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for retry logic in Python.",
  "sources": "The class definition itself, specifically the exception class creation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; just a class declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard class documentation and exception definition.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. It includes a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious patterns. It appears to be part of a larger codebase intended to handle retry logic, with no embedded network activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class definition intended for exception handling. There are no signs of malware or security issues.",
