  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines a class `RetryException` inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - It includes a descriptive docstring indicating its purpose for retry logic.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no data processing, input/output, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code matches the description of a simple custom exception class.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports consistently describe the code as a benign, standard class definition for retry logic.\n   - Each report assigns a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores all at 0.\n   - The reasoning in each report aligns with the code's simplicity and clarity.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 is justified given the benign nature and lack of security concerns.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports assume the code is part of a larger system that handles retries; there's no indication of misuse.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here, as the code is purely definitional.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard, harmless exception class.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The current malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are appropriate.\n- No further action or re-scoring is needed.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis code fragment is benign and poses no security risks.",
