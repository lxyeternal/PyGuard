  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for retry logic in Python applications.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; no data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data output or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; no source-to-sink pathways present.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward class definition with no obfuscation or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard custom exception class with proper inheritance from Exception. It includes a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden code, or suspicious activities. No use of third-party libraries or dynamic execution. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical Python conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, implementing a custom exception class for retry mechanisms. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
