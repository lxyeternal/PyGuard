  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code content verification**:\n   - The code is a simple class definition for `RetryException` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - It contains only a docstring explaining its purpose.\n   - There are no data processing, input/output, network activity, or embedded logic.\n   - The code is straightforward, minimal, and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n\n2. **Assessment of potential issues**:\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, external data handling, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The license comment is standard and non-malicious.\n\n3. **Scores review**:\n   - Malware score: 0 — appropriate, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - Obfuscated score: 0 — appropriate, code is clear and straightforward.\n   - Risk score: 0 — justified, as the code is benign and does not introduce security risks.\n\n4. **Logic and reasoning errors**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that this is a benign class definition.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the reports.\n\n5. **Consistency and appropriateness**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The conclusion that there's no malware or security risk is accurate.\n\n6. **Additional considerations**:\n   - Since the code is purely definitional and intended for exception handling, it cannot be malicious on its own.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, benign class definition for a custom exception.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThere are no security concerns or malicious indicators in this code snippet.",
