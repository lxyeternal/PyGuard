  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a simple class definition for `RetryException` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - It includes a descriptive docstring.\n   - There are no data processing, input/output, external interactions, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that this is a benign, standard class definition.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are observed.\n   - The analysis in each report is consistent and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n   - No issues are present in the code.\n   - The reports do not contain any flawed reasoning or inaccuracies.\n\n5. **Overall Risk and Scores:**\n   - Given the simplicity and benign nature, the overall risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n   - The code does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious characteristics.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The code is a standard, well-documented custom exception class with no security concerns.\n- The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are appropriate and should not be changed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The current assessment and scores are accurate.\n- No further action or adjustment is necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign nature and the reports' conclusions.",
