  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review of the Original Snippet:**\n   - The code is a simple class definition:\n     ```python\n     class RetryException(Exception):\n         \"\"\"\n         Defines a custom RetryException that can be raised for specific errors we\n         want to retry on.\n         \"\"\"\n     ```\n   - It inherits from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - Contains a clear docstring explaining its purpose.\n   - No data processing, input/output, network activity, or external dependencies.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n   - License comment is standard.\n\n2. **Summary of the Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently describe the code as a straightforward, benign class definition for a custom exception.\n   - No anomalies, data flows, or malicious behavior are identified.\n   - Confidence is high (1) in all reports.\n   - Malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are all 0 across reports.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Scores:**\n   - The malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly reflecting the straightforward nature.\n   - The security risk score is 0, consistent with the benign, standard class definition.\n   - The overall risk score should be very low, as there's no indication of vulnerability or malicious intent.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Points of Clarification:**\n   - The code itself is minimal and standard; it does not pose any security threat.\n   - Since the class is intended for retry logic, it might be used in exception handling, but that alone does not introduce risk.\n   - No assumptions about future usage or integration are necessary; based solely on this snippet, the security posture is safe.\n\n5. **Final Justification:**\n   - All evidence points to this being a benign, standard exception class.\n   - No modifications to scores are needed; they are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical custom exception class with no malicious or security concerns.\n- Scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No further action or escalation is necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the analysis above.",
