  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\nThe provided code is a simple class definition:\n```python\nclass RetryException(Exception):\n    \"\"\"\n    Defines a custom RetryException that can be raised for specific errors we\n    want to retry on.\n    \"\"\"\n```\nThis is a straightforward, standard Python exception class with a descriptive docstring. It contains no data processing, input/output, network activity, or any suspicious constructs. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Assessment of the Reports:**\n\n1. **Purpose & Sources:** All reports correctly identify that this is a class definition for a custom exception used in retry logic. They accurately cite the class as the source.\n\n2. **Sinks & Flows:** All reports correctly note that there are no data sinks, input/output, or data flows involved. The code does not process untrusted data or perform any external operations.\n\n3. **Anomalies & Analysis:** All reports agree that the code is straightforward, well-documented, and contains no anomalies such as obfuscation, embedded malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n4. **Conclusions & Confidence:** The consensus is that this is a benign, standard pattern for defining a custom exception. The confidence score of 1 across all reports is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Scores & Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, indicating no security risk. This is correct given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary; the report is accurate.\n- The code itself does not pose any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThis is a straightforward, benign class definition for a custom exception used in retry logic. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe class definition with no malicious or security issues. The report's assessments are accurate, and no adjustments are needed.",
