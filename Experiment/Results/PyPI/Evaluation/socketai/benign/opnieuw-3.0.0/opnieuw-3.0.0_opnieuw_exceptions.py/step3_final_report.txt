  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class RetryException for use in retry logic within larger systems.",
  "sources": "The class definition itself; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the class is a simple exception declaration with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python class inheriting from Exception, with a descriptive docstring. It contains no data processing, network activity, or external dependencies. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence (1), and assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard custom exception class with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
