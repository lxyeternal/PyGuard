  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data processing paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with a docstring explaining its intended use for retry logic. No input/output, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. The structure is standard and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign and standard pattern for custom exception definition with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
