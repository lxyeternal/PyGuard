{
  "purpose": "Defines a no-retry backoff strategy and provides a context manager to disable retries for specified decorators.",
  "sources": "import statements, class definition, function definition",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only manages backoff strategies",
  "flows": "The function replace_backoff_calculator likely modifies retry behavior, but no untrusted data flow is evident",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; standard use of class inheritance and context managers",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a local retries module, defines a class to disable backoff (NoRetryBackoff), and a function to return a context manager that disables retries by replacing the backoff calculator. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns. The code appears to facilitate retry management in a controlled manner, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation for disabling retries, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a retry management library, functioning as intended without malicious modifications.",
