{
  "purpose": "This code defines a no-retry backoff strategy and a context manager to disable retries for certain decorators in a larger system.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard and local modules, including 'retries'. The function 'no_retries' which may be called externally.",
  "sinks": "The 'replace_backoff_calculator' function call could potentially modify retry behavior in other parts of the system, but this is standard behavior for configuring retries, not malicious.",
  "flows": "The function 'no_retries' returns a context manager that modifies retry behavior globally, with no untrusted input influencing the flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and local modules, defines a class 'NoRetryBackoff' that disables backoff, and provides a function to disable retries within a context. The code appears to be intended for managing retry strategies in a larger system. No external input influences behavior, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for disabling retries within a context. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. It appears safe and benign.",
