  "purpose": "Defines a no-retry backoff class and a context manager to disable retries in a retry mechanism.",
  "sources": "import statements; class NoRetryBackoff; function no_retries",
  "sinks": "replace_backoff_calculator function call; get_backoff method returning None",
  "flows": "no_retries calls replace_backoff_calculator with NoRetryBackoff; get_backoff returns None, likely disabling retries",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward implementation to disable retries",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and defines a subclass NoRetryBackoff that disables backoff by returning None. The function no_retries creates a context manager that replaces the backoff calculator with NoRetryBackoff, effectively disabling retries for specified namespaces. No malicious or suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code. The code appears to serve as a utility for controlling retry behavior in a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code cleanly implements a mechanism to disable retries within a retry framework. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to manage retry logic, and there are no indications of malicious or harmful intent.",
