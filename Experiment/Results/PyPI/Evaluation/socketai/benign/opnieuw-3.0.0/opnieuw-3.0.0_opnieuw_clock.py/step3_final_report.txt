  "purpose": "Provides an abstract interface for clock implementations, with production and testing variants.",
  "sources": "time.monotonic() in MonotonicClock, internal state in DummyClock",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or network interactions",
  "flows": "Method calls to seconds_since_epoch() retrieve current time; DummyClock.advance_to() modifies internal state",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertion in DummyClock.advance_to() to prevent time going backwards; no other anomalies",
  "analysis": "The code defines a clear abstraction for clocks with two implementations: one using standard monotonic time for production, and a dummy for testing with manual control. No external inputs, outputs, or data leaks are present. The assertion ensures internal consistency. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are detected. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to best practices for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It serves as a standard utility for managing time in production and testing environments. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware, obfuscation, and risk scores all set to 0.",
