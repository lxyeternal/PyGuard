  "purpose": "Define abstract and concrete clock interfaces for measuring elapsed time, including production and testing implementations.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`import time`), method calls (`time.monotonic()`, `self.time` access).",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "The production clock (`seconds_since_epoch` in `MonotonicClock`) retrieves system time; the dummy clock (`advance_to`) updates internal state for testing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code structure is straightforward, with clear separation between production and testing implementations. No obfuscated or suspicious code features.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a base class `Clock` with an abstract method, and two implementations: `MonotonicClock` uses system monotonic clock, suitable for measuring durations securely; `DummyClock` is for testing, allowing manual control of the clock. There are no hardcoded secrets, external data reads, or suspicious behaviors. The `advance_to` method includes an assertion to prevent backward time setting, which is a logical safety check. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, with clear purpose for timing in production and testing. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
