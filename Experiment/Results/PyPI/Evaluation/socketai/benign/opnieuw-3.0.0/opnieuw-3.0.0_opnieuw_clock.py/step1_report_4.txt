{
  "purpose": "Define abstract clock interface and two implementations: one for production and one for testing.",
  "sources": "The code reads system time via time.monotonic() in MonotonicClock, and maintains internal time state in DummyClock.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data or external system interaction occurs.",
  "flows": "The MonotonicClock provides system time; DummyClock allows controlled time manipulation in tests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code structure is standard for clock abstraction with no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an abstract Clock class with a method for obtaining seconds since epoch. MonotonicClock implements this using time.monotonic(), suitable for production. DummyClock is a test utility that simulates time, allowing advancement with constraints. No external data inputs, network calls, or data leaks are involved. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is present. The code follows typical design patterns for testability and production use.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of clock abstraction with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies. It is safe and intended for use in both production and testing environments.",
