  "purpose": "Defines abstract and concrete classes for clocks, including production and test implementations.",
  "sources": "Imports from the time module, class initializations, and method calls within classes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of clock objects, calling seconds_since_epoch, and in DummyClock, advancing the clock.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an abstract Clock class with two implementations: MonotonicClock for production use, returning a monotonic clock value, and DummyClock for testing, allowing manual advancement of time. It uses standard library time functions and basic assertions. There are no external data inputs, no network operations, or other side effects. The structure is typical for test utilities. No signs of malicious code or unusual behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a simple utility for handling clocks with production and testing implementations. There are no security concerns, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns detected.",
