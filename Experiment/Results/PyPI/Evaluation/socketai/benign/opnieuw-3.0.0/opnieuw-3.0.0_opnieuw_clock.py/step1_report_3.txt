  "purpose": "Define abstract and concrete clock classes for retrieving time in production and testing environments.",
  "sources": "time.monotonic() method call in MonotonicClock.seconds_since_epoch() and self.advance_to() method in DummyClock.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; primarily internal clock management.",
  "flows": "MonotonicClock.seconds_since_epoch() calls time.monotonic(); DummyClock.advance_to() updates internal state; both provide time data internally.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract and concrete classes for clock management, with clear separation for production and testing. No external data inputs, outputs, or data flows that could lead to security issues. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors detected, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection. The use of time.monotonic() is standard and safe. The DummyClock is for testing purposes only and contains no malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of clock abstractions for production and testing, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
