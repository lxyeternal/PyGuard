  "purpose": "Static type alias definitions for AWS Backup service string literals, used for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines constants directly in the source.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code only declares type aliases without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS Backup constants, with conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, or executable logic. The extensive list of literals serves as type annotations for static analysis and documentation. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are present. The purpose is purely to provide type safety and improve code clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static collection of type alias definitions for AWS Backup service constants. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free from obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its safe and static nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
