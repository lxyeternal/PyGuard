  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the provided reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a static module defining string literal types for AWS Backup service constants.\n- It conditionally imports `Literal` based on Python version, which is standard practice.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or external inputs are present.\n- The literals are straightforward string constants, used for type annotations.\n- The code contains no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n- The documentation and license comments are informational.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for string literals used in backup service.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is static, safe, and standard for type hinting.\n- **Score:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Confidence: 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines type literals for AWS backup enumerations.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the static nature, conditional import, and absence of dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Score:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Confidence: 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for AWS backup interactions.\n- **Analysis:** Accurately describes the static, benign nature, and the purpose of the literals.\n- **Score:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Confidence: 1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Type annotations for a backup SDK.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the code is static, with no runtime data handling or malicious activity.\n- **Score:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Confidence: 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** String literal types for backup constants.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the static nature, no dynamic code, and safe purpose.\n- **Score:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Confidence: 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that there are no malicious elements.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** None of the reports mention obfuscation; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static, non-executable nature of the code, the risk score should be **0** across the board.\n\n**Note on Scores:**  \nThe scores given are all 0 or close to 0, which is appropriate. The only slightly lower confidence (0.9) in report 2 is still acceptable, given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk in static type definitions)\n\nThe code is a benign, static type alias module serving as documentation and type safety aid. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is safe, straightforward, and serves its purpose without any malicious implications.",
