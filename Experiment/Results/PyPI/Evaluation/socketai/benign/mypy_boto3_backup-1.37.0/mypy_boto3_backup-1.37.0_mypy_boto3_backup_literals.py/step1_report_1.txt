{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literals used in the backup service module, primarily for type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions; definitions of string literal types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, user input, or external data processing occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; these are static type definitions used for type checking only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious constructs are present. The code consists solely of type alias definitions and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type aliases for string literals to improve type safety in other parts of the application. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is standard practice. All type definitions are straightforward string literals. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data manipulation exists. The license comment and documentation link are informational. No signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or malware are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static type annotations for various string constants used in the backup service module. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
