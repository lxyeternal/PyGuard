  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency, correctness, and security implications.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static, defining string literal types for AWS Backup service constants.\n- No dynamic code, external data, or user input handling is present.\n- The conditional import of `Literal` from `typing` or `typing_extensions` based on Python version is standard practice.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are evident.\n- The code serves purely as type annotations to improve type safety, IDE support, and documentation.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Clear; defines type annotations for literals used in backup service.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no untrusted data, no anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely static type definitions.\n- **Malware risk:** 0 — accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, clarifies use in static analysis.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no dynamic code or external data.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no malicious signs.\n- **Malware risk:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; static constants, no runtime data.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purely declarative.\n- **Malware risk:** 0 — correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Clear, straightforward.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no dynamic code or external dependencies beyond conditional import.\n- **Conclusion:** No risks.\n- **Malware risk:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Consistent with others.\n- **Analysis:** Accurate; static type alias definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware risk:** 0 — correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and final assessment:\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward static definitions; obfuscation is not present.\n- **Malware:** No indicators of malicious behavior. The code is purely type annotations.\n- **Risk score justification:** All scores for malware and obfuscation are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The current scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed; the code is benign.\n- The purpose of this module is to provide type safety and documentation support for other parts of the SDK.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear static definitions.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, static, and serves a purely documentation and type safety purpose. No security concerns or malicious intent are present.",
