  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various backup service-related constants used in type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions, and the assignment of string literals to type variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code strictly defines type literals without dynamic code execution or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard. It then declares multiple type alias variables assigned to 'Literal' types containing string options. The list of literals appears to be well-structured, consistent, and related to AWS backup services. There are no dynamic code, external data input, or functions that could be exploited. The file serves as a constants definition module with no indications of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe declaration of string literal types for type hinting in a larger codebase. No malicious activity or security risks are present.",
