{
  "purpose": "This code defines type literals for various string-based enumerations used in the AWS Backup service, providing type hints for static analysis and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code sources include the module import statements, the `sys.version_info` check, and the assignment of string literals to variables defining various types.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into security-critical functions or system calls; the code is solely defining constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code; it only establishes type aliases without any runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code contains extensive static data definitions but no dynamic or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports the `Literal` type based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility. It then declares a large number of string literal types representing AWS Backup and related service constants, used for type hinting in a larger codebase. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data manipulation occurs. The code is purely declarative and adheres to common Python typing practices for constants.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a benign, static collection of type aliases for AWS Backup string literals, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a helper module for type safety and documentation. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are detectable.",
