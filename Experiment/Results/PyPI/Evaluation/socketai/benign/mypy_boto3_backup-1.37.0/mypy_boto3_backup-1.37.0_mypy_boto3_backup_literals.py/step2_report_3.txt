  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the reports and the code:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \n   - The code consists solely of static type alias definitions for string literals used in AWS Backup services.  \n   - No dynamic code, data processing, or external input handling exists.  \n   - The conditional import of `Literal` from `typing` or `typing_extensions` based on Python version is standard practice for compatibility.  \n   - The extensive list of string literal types and the `__all__` export are typical for a constants/type definitions module.  \n   **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious code are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n   - All reports correctly identify that this code is purely static type alias definitions for AWS backup constants.  \n   - They note the absence of dynamic code, external data, or suspicious constructs.  \n   - The reports mention the conditional import pattern, which is standard and appropriate.  \n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the analysis.  \n   **Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and well-founded.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n   - The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n   - The security risk score is 0, consistent with the static, safe definitions.  \n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0 or 0.9), which is justified given the straightforward static nature.  \n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores align with the code's characteristics.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores**  \n   - The code does not perform any runtime operations, data handling, or external interactions.  \n   - No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n   - The purpose is purely to aid static type checking and documentation.  \n   - Therefore, the risk and malware scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n   - All reports correctly interpret the code as static type definitions.  \n   - No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.  \n   - The code is not used as an attack vector or for malicious purposes.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \n   - The current scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.  \n   - The high confidence levels are justified.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, static collection of type alias definitions for AWS Backup service constants. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free from obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo changes needed. The code is safe and well-understood.",
