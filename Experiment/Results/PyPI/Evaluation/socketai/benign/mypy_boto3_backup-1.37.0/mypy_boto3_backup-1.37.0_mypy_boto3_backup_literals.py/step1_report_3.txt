{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations for various string literals used in AWS backup service interactions, enabling better type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "The literals are hardcoded string constants defining types, statuses, service names, resource names, and regions, with no runtime data inputs or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform operations influenced by external input; the code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input; the code merely declares literal types.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions using Literal types. No dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The only notable feature is the conditional import based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static collection of type alias definitions for various AWS-related string literals. It includes conditional import logic for 'Literal' based on Python version, which is common for compatibility. No runtime data processing, external data handling, or potentially malicious patterns are present. It functions solely as type hinting infrastructure, with no behavior that could be malicious or a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign, purely declarative set of type aliases for AWS backup service constants. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data processing, and no suspicious code structures. It is safe for use and appears to serve a documentation and type safety purpose.",
