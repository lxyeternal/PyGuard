  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for AWS Backup SDK client, facilitating static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Method signatures, type annotations, class properties, import statements, and documentation links.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; interactions occur via method signatures and property accesses, primarily API calls to AWS services.",
  "flows": "Static flow through method signatures and kwargs unpacking; no dynamic data processing or malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated SDK interface with extensive type annotations, overloads, and documentation links. It contains no executable logic, data manipulation, or network activity beyond AWS API calls. The structure is consistent with a benign, auto-generated stub for static type safety and IDE support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious SDK interface for AWS Backup, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
