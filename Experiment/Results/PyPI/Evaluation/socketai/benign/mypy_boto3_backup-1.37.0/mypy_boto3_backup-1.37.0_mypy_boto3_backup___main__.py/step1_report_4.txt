  "analysis": "The code defines functions to print package info and version details. It reads command-line arguments and prints corresponding data. No user input is processed besides sys.argv. The code only outputs static information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code. It does not connect to external domains, read sensitive data, or perform any suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign CLI script designed to display static package information and version number. No malicious intent or security risks are present.",
