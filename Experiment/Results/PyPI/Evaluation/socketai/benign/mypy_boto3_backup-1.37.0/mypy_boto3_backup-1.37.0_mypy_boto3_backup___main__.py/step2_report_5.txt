  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI script that prints static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - No external data sources, no network calls, no dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Issues Present in the Code:**\n   - None. The code is benign and does not contain any security flaws or malicious logic.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is straightforward, benign, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that no untrusted data is processed beyond command-line arguments, and output is static.\n   - No inaccuracies or logical flaws are apparent in the summaries.\n\n4. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious behavior, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - The code does not perform any dangerous operations, external calls, or data exfiltration.\n\n6. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity detected or implied.\n\n7. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n8. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature, and scores reflect that.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the code and reports, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a simple, static CLI utility with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is entirely benign. No security concerns or malicious activity are present. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
