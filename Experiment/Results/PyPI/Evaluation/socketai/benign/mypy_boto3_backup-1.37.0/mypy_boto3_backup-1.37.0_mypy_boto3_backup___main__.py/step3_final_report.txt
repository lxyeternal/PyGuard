  "purpose": "A simple CLI script that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting information",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) to output functions (print_info or print_version)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with static output, no external data sources, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI utility that responds to '--version' argument by printing version info, otherwise prints package info. It only reads command-line arguments and writes static data to stdout. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is simple, clear, and free of suspicious patterns or malicious logic. The absence of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or external dependencies indicates benign behavior. The code's purpose is informational, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or obfuscation present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with high confidence in this assessment.",
