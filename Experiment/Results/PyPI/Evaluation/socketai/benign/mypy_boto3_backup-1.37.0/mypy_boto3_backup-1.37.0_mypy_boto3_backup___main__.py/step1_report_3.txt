{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI entry point for a package, providing information about the package and its version.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (user input), sys.stdout (output to user)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (writes data to the terminal), sys.argv (reads command-line arguments)",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() is called, which outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No network activity or data exfiltration observed. No obfuscation or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that prints package information or version based on user input. It uses standard Python modules (sys) to read command-line arguments and output data. There are no signs of malicious code such as data leaks, code injection, or external communications. The code appears to be benign, mainly for informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package info and version. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
