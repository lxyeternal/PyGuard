  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about a Python package related to boto3 backups.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reading command line arguments), sys.stdout (writing output)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputting package info and version)",
  "flows": "Command line input (--version) triggers version info output; otherwise, info output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and only outputs static info",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI script that responds to '--version' argument by printing version info, otherwise prints package info. It imports only standard library modules and outputs static text. No input data from untrusted sources is processed, and no data is sent over the network or interacts with external systems. The code does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility intended to display package information. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
