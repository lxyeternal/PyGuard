  "purpose": "CLI utility for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (user input), sys.stdout (output to console).",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs info to console).",
  "flows": "User input via command-line arguments triggers print_version, which outputs version info; otherwise, package info is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious external calls. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward CLI logic: it checks for '--version' in command-line arguments and prints corresponding information. It uses standard library modules (sys) with no external dependencies or potentially dangerous behaviors. No data is read from untrusted sources aside from command-line args, which are handled safely. The output is static informational text with no network activity, no code injection, and no data leakage. The script's purpose is benign, simply displaying package info and version.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It simply prints package-related information based on user input.",
