  "flows": "Command-line argument check from sys.argv leads to printing version info or package info to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version to stdout, and conditionally executes based on command-line args. No external data sources or sinks are involved beyond standard output. The code is simple and intended for informational purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No suspicious patterns or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script that outputs package information and version details. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
