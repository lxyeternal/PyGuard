  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details.\n   - It imports only the standard library (`sys`).\n   - It responds to the `--version` argument by printing the version; otherwise, it prints package info.\n   - There are no external data sources, no user input processing beyond command-line args, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify the code's purpose as informational.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are detected.\n   - No external or untrusted data sinks are involved, only `sys.stdout.write`.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification:**\n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is justified; no malicious activity is present.\n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - **Confidence:** All reports are confident (1), justified by the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The only point to consider is whether the \"malware\" score should be higher. Given the code's content, it should remain at 0.\n   - The \"risk\" score is correctly low, as there's no vulnerability or security concern.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified.\n   - No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.\n   - The code is a simple, benign CLI utility.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code and reports:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is entirely benign, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.",
