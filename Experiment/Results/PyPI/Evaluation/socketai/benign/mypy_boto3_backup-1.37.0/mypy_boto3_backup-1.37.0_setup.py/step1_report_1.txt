  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the Python module 'mypy-boto3-backup'.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of README.md for long description, imports setup from setuptools, and reads package metadata such as name, version, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code does not process untrusted input or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code follows standard setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script used for packaging a Python library. It imports necessary modules, reads a markdown file for description, and calls setup() with fixed package data and metadata. All data appears to be hardcoded or read from trusted sources; no external inputs or user-controlled data are processed. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscated code.",
