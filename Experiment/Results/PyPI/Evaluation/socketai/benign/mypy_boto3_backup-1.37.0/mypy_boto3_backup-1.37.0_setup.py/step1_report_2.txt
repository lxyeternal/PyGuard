  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-backup package, used for packaging and distributing the library.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; static strings for package metadata; imports from standard library and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; no network or file writes involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A; all data is static or file-based read during setup, with no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. All code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads a static README file, and calls setuptools.setup() with predefined metadata. No user input, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package setup, indicating no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for packaging purposes.",
