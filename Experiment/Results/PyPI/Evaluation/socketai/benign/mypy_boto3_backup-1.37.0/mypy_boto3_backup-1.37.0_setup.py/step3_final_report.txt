  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-backup Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long_description; static package metadata; no external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> passes static metadata to setup() -> no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and uses standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It imports Path and setuptools.setup, reads a local README.md file for description, and calls setup() with static metadata, dependencies, and package data. There are no dynamic code executions, external inputs, network calls, or suspicious patterns. The code structure is clear, and no secrets or obfuscation are present. All signals indicate a benign, standard packaging script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, legitimate setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as benign, and the scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
