{
  "purpose": "This script is used for setting up the mypy-boto3-backup package, providing metadata and dependencies for packaging and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, static strings defining package metadata, and dependencies specified in the install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the script primarily loads static data and metadata for package setup.",
  "flows": "Data flows from reading the README.md file into the long_description variable, then into the setup() function as part of package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of Path for reading a static file is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and uses setuptools for package configuration. It reads a static README.md file for the long description, and defines package metadata including name, version, URL, author info, classifiers, keywords, and dependencies. All data are static or derived from local files. No external input or untrusted data is processed. There are no indications of malicious behavior or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads a local file for descriptive content and sets package metadata and dependencies securely. Overall, it appears safe and legitimate.",
