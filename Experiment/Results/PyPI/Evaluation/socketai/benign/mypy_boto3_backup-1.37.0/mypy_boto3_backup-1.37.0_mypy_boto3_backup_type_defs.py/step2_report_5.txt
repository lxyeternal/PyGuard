  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency, correctness, and to determine the actual security posture.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for AWS Backup SDK.\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely static type annotations, with no executable logic, external data handling, or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. This aligns with the code content.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected. The report's assessment is accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining data structures with type annotations.\n- **Analysis:** Again, the code is static, with no runtime logic or suspicious patterns. Use of conditional imports for version compatibility is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for AWS Backup data structures.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; no executable code, no external data processing, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for AWS Backup SDK.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime logic, external data handling, or obfuscation. Purely static type annotations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Type definitions for AWS Backup SDK.\n- **Analysis:** Same as others; static, well-structured, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify zero malware presence.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is purely static type annotations with no executable or external data handling, the risk score should be **0**.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK, intended solely for static type checking.\n- No dynamic code, no secrets, no network calls, no obfuscation, no malicious payloads.\n- The use of conditional imports and type annotations aligns with best practices for compatibility and clarity.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the purpose of the code. It is a safe, standard SDK type definitions file with no security concerns.",
