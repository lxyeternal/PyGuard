  "purpose": "Type definitions and data structures for AWS Backup service, facilitating data validation and API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (__future__, sys, datetime, typing, typing_extensions, internal modules), constants, and class/type definitions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data serialization/deserialization points, data processing functions (not explicitly shown but implied), and data storage/retrieval in API requests/responses.",
  "flows": "Data flows from type annotations to data structures; no executable code or data manipulation shown.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of standard type hints, data structures, and union types appear typical. No network calls, file I/O, or code execution mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and imports for typing support, with no executable logic, external data processing, or network interactions. All type definitions are for validation and API contract purposes. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or payloads are present. The code appears to be well-structured and aligned with typical SDK or API schema definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only type definitions for AWS Backup service, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely declarative and intended for type safety and validation. No malicious intent or sabotage is detected.",
