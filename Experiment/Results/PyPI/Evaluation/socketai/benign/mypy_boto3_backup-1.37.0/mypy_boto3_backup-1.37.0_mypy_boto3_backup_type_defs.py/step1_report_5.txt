  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS Backup service data structures, used for type checking and documentation in SDK or client implementations.",
  "sources": "Type annotation declarations, import statements, and data structure definitions, especially in class and Union type declarations.",
  "sinks": "None identified explicitly; no code that executes commands, reads untrusted input, or writes data outside of data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; all code consists of static type definitions without executable logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. The code is purely declarative with standard type annotations and definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines numerous TypedDict classes and type aliases for use in AWS Backup SDKs, ensuring structured data handling. No functions, network calls, file I/O, or dynamic execution present. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious constructs. The code appears to be an intentionally authored set of type definitions without any malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS Backup SDK data structures. It contains no executable logic, network activity, or suspicious patterns. There are no signs of malware, malicious code, or security risks within this code fragment.",
