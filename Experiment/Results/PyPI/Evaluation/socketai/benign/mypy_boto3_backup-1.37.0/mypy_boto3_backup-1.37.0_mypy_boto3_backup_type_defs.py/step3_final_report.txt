{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type definitions for AWS Backup SDK data structures using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for version compatibility. It serves as type annotations and documentation for SDK users.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, import statements, literals, constants, and class/type definitions within the module.",
  "sinks": "None; static type declarations without runtime data handling or external data sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution; purely static type annotations and data schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected. Use of standard compatibility imports is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions for various AWS Backup data structures, employing TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. There are no functions, no dynamic code, no external I/O, and no embedded secrets or obfuscation. The structure is consistent, well-organized, and adheres to best practices for type hinting. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, static set of type definitions for AWS Backup SDK, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe and appropriate for use as SDK type annotations and documentation.",
