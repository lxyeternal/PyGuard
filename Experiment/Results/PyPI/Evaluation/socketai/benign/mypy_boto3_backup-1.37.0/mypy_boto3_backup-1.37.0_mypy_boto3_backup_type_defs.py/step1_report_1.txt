  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS Backup service data structures using TypedDict and Union for type safety and clarity.",
  "sources": "Type annotations for data structures; imports from standard and third-party typing modules; constants imported from '.literals'.",
  "sinks": "None evident. No functions, no external data inputs, no network calls or environment variable uses; only type definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow execution; solely static type annotations defining data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of NotRequired, Union, and various type annotations appear standard for version compatibility. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively consists of data type definitions for a backup service SDK, employing Python's TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports based on sys.version_info. It imports only type-related modules and literals, with no executable logic, network calls, or input/output operations. There are no suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or code injections. The structure follows best practices for type annotations and version compatibility. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected in the static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for type annotations and data structure definitions, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK or API client.",
