  "purpose": "Type definitions and annotations for AWS Backup service data structures.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules like sys, datetime, typing, and internal literals; class and type definitions; union and intersection type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted input data; type annotations mainly define data structures, not executable code or data flow.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows involving untrusted input; primarily static type definitions with no execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments; code is predominantly type definitions and documentation. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or system modifications present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a large collection of TypedDict class definitions, union types, and constants for AWS Backup SDK. It includes type annotations, import statements, and documentation comments. There are no functions executing logic, no data handling, no network or file operations, and no code that could be maliciously manipulated. The import statements are standard and safe. No obfuscated or suspicious language features are used. The code is purely for static type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS Backup SDK in Python. It is static, non-executable, and contains no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The structure and content indicate it is a legitimate, well-formed SDK type hints file without security risks.",
