  "purpose": "Define detailed type annotations for AWS Backup service data structures using TypedDict and Union for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and data structure definitions primarily involving import statements, type aliasing, and TypedDict class definitions. No runtime data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data output points involving untrusted data processing or external communication within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; this module solely declares types and data structures for static type checking.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard for compatibility, not obfuscation. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or misleading variables observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type definitions using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports to support type annotations across different Python versions. All classes and type aliases serve to provide static typing hints for a larger AWS Backup SDK implementation. No runtime logic, external data handling, or network communication exists. No indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are present. The structure and content align with typical SDK type definitions. There is no obfuscation; the code is straightforward with standard use of type annotations and version compatibility handling.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code contains only type declarations and compatibility imports with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a purely declarative module intended for static type checking, and does not execute any untrusted or harmful actions.",
