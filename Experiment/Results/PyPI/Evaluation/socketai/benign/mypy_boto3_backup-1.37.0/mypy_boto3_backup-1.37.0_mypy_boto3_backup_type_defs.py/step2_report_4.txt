  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically to verify the claims, assess the scores, and ensure consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states that the code is for type definitions for AWS Backup, with imports from standard and third-party typing modules, and literals. No issues here.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Only static type annotations; no runtime or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code is purely declarative, employing TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for version compatibility.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It’s a standard SDK type definitions file.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (certain)\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, defining data structures with type annotations. No runtime data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Static type definitions only.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Use of sys.version_info for compatibility is standard.\n- **Analysis:** All classes and types serve static type checking; no executable logic.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; code is straightforward and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—type definitions, import statements, constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Entirely static type annotations for SDK data structures.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; purely declarative.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — correct.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on type definitions, no runtime data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Static type annotations only.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** The code is purely declarative, defining data structures for SDK use.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior or security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others—type annotations, class definitions, constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime logic.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.\n- **Analysis:** Static type definitions, no executable code or data flow.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code content:** Entirely static type definitions, employing TypedDict, Union, conditional imports, and constants.\n- **Malware / Obfuscation:** None detected in any report.\n- **Security risk:** None; no executable code, secrets, or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** All reports correctly assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and risk as 0, which aligns with the static, declarative nature of the code.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the consistent, thorough analysis, I agree with the scores and conclusions of all reports. The code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations for an SDK, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis matches the current evaluations and is justified by the static, non-executable, and safe nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
