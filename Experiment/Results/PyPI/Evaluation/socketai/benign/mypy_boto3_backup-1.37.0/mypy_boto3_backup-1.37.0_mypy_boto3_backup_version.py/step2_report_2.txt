  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`, with no dynamic behavior, input/output, or external data handling. The only anomaly noted is the future year (2025) in the copyright comment, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. The only minor point is the future year, which is not a security concern but worth noting as a possible typo.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n   - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n   - `malware`: 0 (no malware)\n   - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)  \n\n   These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is correct. The code is purely informational, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   No questionable assumptions are present. The reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Additional notes**:  \nThe only minor anomaly is the future year (2025) in the comment, which is likely a typo or placeholder. It does not impact security but could be corrected for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Metric             | Score | Justification                                                  |\n|--------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious code or behavior present.                          |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Code is simple, clear, and straightforward.                      |\n| Security Risk      | 0       | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or malicious intent.           |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no security concerns.**",
