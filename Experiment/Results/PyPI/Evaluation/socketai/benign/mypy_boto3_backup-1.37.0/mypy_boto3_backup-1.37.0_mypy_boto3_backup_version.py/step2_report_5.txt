  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the underlying code.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- There are no inputs, outputs, or data flows involving untrusted sources.\n- The code is minimal, with only a comment, a copyright notice, and a simple variable assignment.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or dynamic behavior are present.\n- The only notable anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which could be a typo or placeholder but is not malicious.\n\n**Assessment of individual reports:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - Confirms benign, straightforward code.  \n   - No issues.  \n   - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - Similar to Report 1, confirms benign nature.  \n   - No issues.  \n   - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - Notes the future year (2025) as unusual but not malicious.  \n   - No actual security concern, just an anomaly in the comment.  \n   - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - Reiterates the simplicity and benign nature.  \n   - No issues.  \n   - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - Same conclusion as others, minimal code, no malicious activity.  \n   - No issues.  \n   - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low (0), given the simplicity and lack of any suspicious activity.\n- The malware scores are correctly zero, as there's no indication of malicious behavior.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard version declaration, serving only an informational purpose.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is entirely benign, with no security concerns. The reports are thorough and accurate.",
