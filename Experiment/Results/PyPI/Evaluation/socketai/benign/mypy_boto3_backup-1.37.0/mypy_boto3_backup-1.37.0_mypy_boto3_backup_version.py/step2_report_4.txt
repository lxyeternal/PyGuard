  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the scores assigned, and the overall security implications.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`, with a copyright comment.\n- The code is minimal, static, and contains no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors is present.\n\n**Step 2: Check for errors, flaws, or logical mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with consistent reasoning.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future year \"2025\" in the copyright comment, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n  - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n  - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n  - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n\n- These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the code being benign.\n- No justification needed for higher scores.\n\n**Step 5: Review malware scores**\n\n- All reports assign `malware`: 0, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis.\n- Given the code's simplicity, this assumption is valid.\n- No hidden vulnerabilities or malicious intent are suggested.\n\n**Step 7: Ensure consistency of scores**\n\n- The scores are consistent across reports and appropriate for the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening aspects.**\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional note:** The only minor anomaly is the future year \"2025\" in the comment, which might be a typo or placeholder, but it does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign.\n- No changes needed in scoring.\n- The code presents no security concern.\n\n**Final recommendation:** All scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.",
