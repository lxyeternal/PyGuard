  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of a straightforward assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No external data sources or sinks are involved.\n   - The code includes only a comment, a copyright notice, and a simple assignment.\n\n2. **Potential Anomalies**:\n   - The only noteworthy point is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is in the future relative to the current date (2023). This could be a typo, placeholder, or oversight but is not malicious.\n\n3. **Malicious or Obfuscated Code**:\n   - No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n   - No signs of code hiding or malicious payloads.\n   - Malware scores are all zero, consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Security Risks**:\n   - The code is purely declarative, serving only as a version marker.\n   - No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks.\n   - Security risk scores are all zero, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Score Justification**:\n   - The scores assigned in each report (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n   - No reason to adjust these scores.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The only unusual aspect is the future year in the copyright.\n   - This does not impact security but might be flagged as a minor anomaly.\n\n**Summary**:\n- All reports are accurate in their assessment.\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns.",
