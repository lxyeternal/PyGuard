  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to a variable (`__version__`), with no external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behavior.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious or obfuscated logic.\n   - The only anomaly noted is the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n   - The mention of the future year as an anomaly is appropriate but does not impact security.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n   - The security risk score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is correct.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior, higher risk scores would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's actual behavior.\n   - The only noted anomaly (future year) is not considered malicious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard version declaration with no dynamic behavior, no external data handling, and no malicious intent. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not a security concern.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code poses no security threat.",
