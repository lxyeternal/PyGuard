  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment, a copyright statement, and a simple assignment of a version string to a variable. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscated logic, or hidden behaviors are present. It appears to be a standard version declaration for a Python package.",
