  "anomalies": "Future year '2025' in comment, likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to __version__, with a comment and copyright notice. No dynamic behavior, inputs, outputs, or external data handling. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The only anomaly is the future year, which is not security-related. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, security risk score is 0, and confidence is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version marker with no malicious or security concerns. The only minor anomaly is the future year in the comment, which does not impact security.",
