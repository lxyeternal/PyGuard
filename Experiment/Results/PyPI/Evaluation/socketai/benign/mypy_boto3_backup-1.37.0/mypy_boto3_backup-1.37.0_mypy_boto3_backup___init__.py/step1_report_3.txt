{
  "purpose": "To provide an interface and documentation for a backup service SDK, including imports, client instantiation, and paginator setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator), static assignment of BackupClient to Client, and module metadata (__all__).",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data input or output operations.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up class and function references; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior observed. The copyright year (2025) is in the future, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from internal modules, assigns a class to a variable for external use, and defines __all__ for module exports. The structure is typical for a Python SDK module. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright date, but it does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard SDK interface module with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply imports, assigns, and exposes SDK components for use.",
