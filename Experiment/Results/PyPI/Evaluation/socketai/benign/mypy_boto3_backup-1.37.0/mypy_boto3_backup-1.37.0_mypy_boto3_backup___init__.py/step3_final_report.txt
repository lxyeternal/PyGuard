  "purpose": "This code serves as a Python module that organizes imports and documentation for the AWS Backup SDK, providing a structured interface for users.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only imports local classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely structural and documentation-oriented.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup module defining imports, class aliases, and documentation for an SDK. It contains no dynamic code, data processing, or network activity. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The future copyright year is likely a placeholder or typo. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign SDK interface module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
