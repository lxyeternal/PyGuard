{
  "purpose": "Defines the main interface and imports for the AWS Backup service SDK, facilitating paginated listing of backup resources.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client, .paginator), module-level variable assignments, and docstring containing example usage.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted external data; the code mainly sets up class imports, type annotations, and documentation.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing classes, assigning aliases, and exporting symbols; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily structural, providing import statements, class aliases, and documentation for a set of paginator classes related to AWS Backup. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, or user input handling. The example in the docstring is standard usage documentation. No suspicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious intent is observable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup for AWS Backup SDK with no signs of malicious or maliciously manipulated code. It is safe and appears to be a standard, well-structured interface module.",
