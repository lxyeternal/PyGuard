  "purpose": "Define paginators for AWS Backup service in boto3-stubs for type annotations and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Type annotation imports, class definitions, method signatures, and dynamic paginator creation via client.get_paginator()",
  "sinks": "Method 'paginate' accepts **kwargs with type Unpack[...] which could potentially include untrusted input; however, it is standard for boto3 paginators and not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "Client.get_paginator() retrieves a paginator object; paginate() method takes **kwargs, passing untrusted data directly to boto3's pagination mechanism.",
  "anomalies": "Code is standard for boto3-stubs with no suspicious or malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No dynamic code execution or network operations present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for paginator wrappers, including type annotations and method signatures for 'paginate'. It imports types for input/output definitions, sets up class inheritance based on type checks, and wraps boto3's Paginator class. The 'paginate' methods are stubs with no actual implementation, relying on boto3's underlying behavior. No suspicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is evident. The code appears to be a standard, type-annotated interface layer for AWS SDK paginators, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured type annotation layer for boto3 Backup paginators. It does not include any malicious or sabotage behavior. All patterns are consistent with SDK stub generation and type safety enhancement. Therefore, it poses no security risk.",
