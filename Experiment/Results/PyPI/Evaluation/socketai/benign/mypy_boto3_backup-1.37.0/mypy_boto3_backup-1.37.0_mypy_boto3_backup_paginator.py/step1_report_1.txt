  "purpose": "Define paginators for AWS Backup service in boto3, providing type annotations and pagination functionality.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily received via method parameters (**kwargs) in the paginate() methods, with type definitions imported from type_defs module. No other explicit input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially flow from method parameters to paginators' internal processing; however, these are standard boto3 paginator methods with no evidence of malicious data handling or external data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input via **kwargs flows into paginate() methods, which call the underlying Paginator's paginate method, returning PageIterator objects. No external or untrusted data is sent over the network or stored maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code strictly defines classes and methods following boto3 standards. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is detected. The code is well-structured and clean.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of paginator classes for AWS Backup using type annotations, conditional imports, and class inheritance. Each class provides a paginate() method with type-annotated parameters, calling the base Paginator's paginate(). There are no signs of data leakage, network activity, or malicious behavior. The code only sets up paginator classes with clear documentation links, adhering to standard patterns for AWS SDK extensions. The presence of type definitions and detailed docstrings suggests a focus on type safety and documentation, not malicious intent. No external network activity, file operations, or system modifications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured set of paginator class definitions for AWS Backup SDK. It includes no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a standard type annotation and class extension implementation, with no suspicious signals detected.",
