  "purpose": "Defines paginator classes for AWS Backup service with type annotations, facilitating static analysis and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Method parameters in paginate() methods, which pass **kwargs to boto3's paginator.",
  "sinks": "The paginate() methods invoke boto3's paginator with untrusted input; no data is processed or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Input flows from method parameters into the paginator's internal call, with no external data handling or malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected; code strictly follows boto3 SDK patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for paginators, with type annotations and conditional imports for Python versions. The paginate() methods are stubs delegating to boto3's paginator, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The code is a standard, safe, and well-structured static type support layer for AWS SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and intended for static type checking. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The high confidence scores and zero malware/risk scores are justified.",
