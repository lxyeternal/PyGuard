{
  "purpose": "Define typed paginator classes for AWS Backup service client, enabling type-safe pagination over various backup-related API calls.",
  "sources": "The code imports type definitions, sys module, and boto3 paginator classes; defines paginator subclasses with paginate methods; uses type hints and conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or interact with external systems directly; the paginate methods simply declare type-annotated interfaces without executing logic.",
  "flows": "The code creates paginator classes with paginate methods accepting flexible keyword arguments, but contains no runtime data processing or external data flow beyond class and method definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code appears standard for type-annotated boto3 paginator wrappers, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured set of paginator class definitions for the boto3 Backup client, utilizing type annotations for improved static analysis. It conditionally imports 'Unpack' from 'typing_extensions' for Python versions below 3.12. The classes extend Paginator with specific output types, and the paginate methods are stubbed with proper type hints. No runtime logic or external data processing exists. The structure and content are consistent with typical type stub files or wrapper definitions for AWS SDKs, with no signs of malicious code or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, type-annotated set of paginator class definitions intended to enhance static type checking for AWS Backup SDK. No malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. It is a standard, safe pattern for type stub definitions.",
