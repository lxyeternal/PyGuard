{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive unit test suite for the SPARQLWrapper Python library, executing various queries against a public SPARQL endpoint to verify correct behavior across multiple formats and methods.",
  "sources": "Static query strings defined within the code, including predefined SELECT, ASK, CONSTRUCT, and DESCRIBE queries, as well as configuration for the endpoint and request parameters.",
  "sinks": "Network requests made via the SPARQLWrapper.query() method to the public endpoint, with response data processed into various formats; no untrusted data is written to disk or executed.",
  "flows": "The code sets queries and request parameters, performs network calls to the endpoint, and processes responses; no untrusted input influences the request content or flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution are present. Some tests are skipped due to unsupported formats, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured test suite that interacts solely with a public, trusted endpoint. It performs read-only network requests, handles errors gracefully, and verifies response formats. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage are evident. The extensive coverage and use of standard libraries support its benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing utility for the SPARQLWrapper library, with no malicious intent or malicious code detected. It poses minimal security risk, primarily due to network interactions with a public endpoint, and contains no obfuscated or secret code.",
