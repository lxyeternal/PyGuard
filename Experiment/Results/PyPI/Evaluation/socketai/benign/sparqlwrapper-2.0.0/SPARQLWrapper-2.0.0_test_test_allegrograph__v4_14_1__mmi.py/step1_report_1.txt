{
  "purpose": "The script performs automated testing of the SPARQLWrapper library for querying a remote SPARQL endpoint with various formats and configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data primarily from predefined SPARQL query strings, environment variables, and the endpoint URL; also reads from the sys and inspect modules for path manipulations.",
  "sinks": "Uses the SPARQLWrapper library to send HTTP requests; processes responses with .info() and .convert() methods; the code also writes error messages to stdout.",
  "flows": "The source data (queries) flows into the SPARQLWrapper.setQuery() method, then to the query() method which performs HTTP requests; responses are processed via info() and convert().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or dynamic code execution; extensive test coverage with various formats and intentional skips. No suspicious URL manipulations or payloads found.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines multiple static SPARQL queries used for testing. It performs various HTTP methods (GET/POST) and content negotiation scenarios, checking for response types and handling exceptions (e.g., HTTPError). The test cases include skipping unsupported formats and handling response content types. No dynamic input processing or untrusted data flows are detected. The code's primary purpose is test automation of the SPARQLWrapper library, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a comprehensive, well-structured test suite for the SPARQLWrapper library targeting a specific endpoint. There are no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or malware. It solely performs HTTP requests for testing and validation purposes.",
