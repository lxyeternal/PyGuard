{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive set of unittests for the SPARQLWrapper library, testing various query types and response formats against a public SPARQL endpoint. It uses static, hardcoded queries with no user input or dynamic data processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the hardcoded query strings and the fixed endpoint URL; network requests are made to the public endpoint.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to the public endpoint; no data exfiltration, command execution, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code constructs queries, sends them via HTTP to the endpoint, and processes the responses; no untrusted data flows or malicious payloads are present.",
  "anomalies": "Many tests are skipped due to server errors, which are endpoint limitations rather than malicious activity. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured test suite for a Python SPARQL client, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. It interacts with a known public endpoint, performs standard network requests, and validates response types. The skipped tests are due to endpoint errors, not malicious intent. No untrusted input, code injection, or hidden payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate testing script with no malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified by network interactions typical in testing environments, with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
