  "purpose": "The code is used to configure and execute the setup process for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No specific data sources or input reading is present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output is present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply calls setup() without parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for package setup; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls its 'setup()' function with default parameters. This is a typical pattern for Python package setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated segments, or suspicious activity. The script does not perform any data input/output, network activity, or sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard minimal setup script for a Python package and does not exhibit any malicious or security-risk behaviors.",
