{
  "purpose": "The code is used to configure and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads; only imports and function calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code merely executes setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of parameters or customizations; very minimal code structure, which is typical for a basic setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setup' function from setuptools and executes it with default parameters. There are no hardcoded credentials, no network calls, no data processing, and no suspicious logic. The code is a standard minimal setup script used in Python packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It performs a common package installation routine without any suspicious modifications.",
