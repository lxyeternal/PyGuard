  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions as a testing framework for a client library, interacting only with a public endpoint using static queries. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are justified and consistent with the analysis."
