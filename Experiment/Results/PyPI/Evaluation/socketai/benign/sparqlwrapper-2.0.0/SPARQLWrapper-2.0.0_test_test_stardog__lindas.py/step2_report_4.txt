  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential risks, and consistency with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** The script performs automated tests on a public SPARQL endpoint with static queries. No external user input or dynamic data is involved.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network interactions are limited to predefined queries; no data leaks or injection points are evident.\n- **Anomalies:** No credentials, secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a benign test suite, primarily for validation, with no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code or payloads)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, static code)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to network activity to a public endpoint)  \n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning is sound. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Similar to Report 1—unit tests for the SPARQLWrapper library, with static queries and known endpoint.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing or injection risks.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation. Standard testing pattern.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate testing suite, with no malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate given the benign nature)\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Again, a test suite executing static queries against a public endpoint.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests with predefined queries; no untrusted data involved.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The script is a safe, controlled testing environment.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (due to network activity, but not risky)\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Static queries and known endpoint; no user input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network calls with static data; no data leakage or injection.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, dynamic code, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe test suite.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (still very low, given the nature)\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Static test cases against a public endpoint, no external untrusted input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests are controlled; no data exfiltration or injection.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a benign test suite.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal)\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a set of static, controlled unit tests against a public SPARQL endpoint. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The network activity is limited to predefined queries, with no untrusted data processing or potential for injection.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious payloads or behavior)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, static code)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (negligible, standard testing activity)\n\n**Final note:** The high confidence in all reports aligns with the technical analysis. No supply chain security threats are evident from this code.",
