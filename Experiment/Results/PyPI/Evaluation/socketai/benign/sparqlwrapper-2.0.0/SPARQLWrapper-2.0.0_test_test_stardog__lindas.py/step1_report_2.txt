{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unittests for the SPARQLWrapper library, testing various query types and response formats against a public SPARQL endpoint.",
  "sources": "Reads include hardcoded SPARQL queries, import statements, and the endpoint URL. No user input is read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The code sends SPARQL queries over HTTP to an external endpoint; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted within the code itself.",
  "flows": "The code constructs queries and sets them in the SPARQLWrapper object, then executes them, receiving results from the endpoint. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code is standard unit test implementation. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious variables are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a test suite for a well-known library (SPARQLWrapper) with predefined queries targeting a public endpoint. It uses standard Python modules and established library imports. All data is statically defined or comes from external libraries. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is observed. The presence of many skipped tests suggests compatibility issues but no malicious intent. There are no signs of backdoors, secret exfiltration, or unauthorized system access mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate test suite for the SPARQLWrapper library, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It only performs HTTP requests to a public SPARQL endpoint and uses static queries. No security risks or malware are detected.",
