{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the SPARQLWrapper library, designed to test querying an RDF endpoint with various query formats, methods, and accept headers.",
  "sources": "The code reads static query strings, endpoint URL, and configuration variables. It does not read user input or untrusted external data during execution.",
  "sinks": "The code executes network requests to a remote SPARQL endpoint. No untrusted data flows directly into these requests from user input; queries are predefined strings.",
  "flows": "Predefined query strings are sent via the network request functions of SPARQLWrapper. No dynamic or user-supplied data flows into request parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present. The code contains several skipped tests due to server behavior, but these are related to server responses, not malicious code. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily contains static test cases for an RDF query endpoint, using fixed queries and standard network libraries. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoor access. It does not process untrusted external data or execute dynamic code based on external inputs. The only network interactions are deliberate, controlled requests to a known public endpoint. The code adheres to best practices for test scripts and does not show signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a comprehensive test suite for the SPARQLWrapper library targeting a public RDF endpoint. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. Its purpose is solely for testing library functionality and server responses. No security risks or malware are detected.",
