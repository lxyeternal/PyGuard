{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for a Python library interacting with a public SPARQL endpoint, executing static, predefined queries without user input.",
  "sources": "Static query strings defined within the script, no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to the endpoint URL with predefined queries; no untrusted data processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "Queries are set statically; network interactions are limited to these predefined queries without dynamic input.",
  "anomalies": "No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; no backdoors or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a comprehensive test suite for various SPARQL query types and formats, using well-known libraries and static queries. No dynamic code execution, secrets, or obfuscated code are present. Network interactions are limited to controlled, static queries to a known public endpoint. The code structure is clear, and the intent is testing and validation, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured testing suite with no malicious intent, sabotage, or supply chain security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal network activity without security concerns.",
