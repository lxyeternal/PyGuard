  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the findings are justified, consistent, and if any scores need adjustment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The script performs automated tests on a public SPARQL endpoint with static queries. No user input or external untrusted data is involved.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network interactions are limited to predefined queries; no data leaks or injection points are evident.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- **Overall:** The report correctly identifies this as a benign testing suite, with no malicious intent or supply chain risk.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- Risk: 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to network interactions with a public endpoint)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—unit tests for the library, static queries, no dynamic user input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests are made with static data; no untrusted data processed.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or malicious code detected.\n- **Overall:** Confirmed as a benign test suite with no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0 (no security concern)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, a test suite executing static queries against a public endpoint.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests with static data; no untrusted input.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Overall:** No malicious behavior; purely testing.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, just network calls)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static queries, no user input, no secrets.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests with predefined data; no data leaks or malicious code.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Overall:** Safe, benign test code.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2 (still very low, standard testing)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static test cases for a public RDF endpoint.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data; network calls are controlled.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Overall:** Clearly a benign testing suite.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1 (minimal)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nAll reports consistently identify the code as a benign, static test suite for a public SPARQL endpoint, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1–0.2) are reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or payloads detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just network interactions with a public endpoint, no sensitive data or external untrusted input)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no supply chain threat indications. The reports' scores are justified and should remain as is.",
