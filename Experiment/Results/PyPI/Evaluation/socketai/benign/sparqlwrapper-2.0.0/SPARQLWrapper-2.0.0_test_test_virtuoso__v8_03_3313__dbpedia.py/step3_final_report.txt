{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive unit test suite for the SPARQLWrapper Python library, testing various query types and response formats against a public SPARQL endpoint.",
  "sources": "The code reads static query strings and constructs network requests to the trusted, publicly accessible endpoint at https://live.dbpedia.org/sparql.",
  "sinks": "Network requests are sent to the endpoint; no untrusted data is processed locally or injected into system commands.",
  "flows": "The source strings (queries) are sent via HTTP GET or POST to the endpoint, and responses are processed and validated for content type and structure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. Error handling uses standard practices. The numerous skipped tests relate to endpoint limitations, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-structured test suite performing read-only network interactions with a trusted public endpoint. It contains no dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or malicious payloads. Error handling is standard, and the test logic is straightforward. No untrusted input influences local code execution or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The network interactions are with a trusted, public resource, and the code performs standard testing procedures. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1).",
