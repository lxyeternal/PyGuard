  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a unit test suite for the SPARQLWrapper library against Wikidata, with static queries and a known endpoint.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** HTTP requests to the endpoint are the main sinks; all queries are hardcoded, with no dynamic or user input.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. External libraries are used normally. No injection points or malicious behavior are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard testing code with no malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This aligns well with the detailed analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" with no raw response data. This indicates a network or endpoint issue, not malicious code.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent, just a failed request or misconfiguration.\n- **Scores:** No malware, obfuscation, or risk. The issue is external and technical, not security-related.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, testing the SPARQLWrapper library with static queries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests are made with predefined queries; no untrusted input.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior. Exception handling is benign, just reporting errors.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate testing code, safe, with no malware or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.9 seems slightly high but acceptable considering the external network activity, which is controlled and static.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue:** \"Empty response,\" again indicating a network or endpoint issue.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Scores:** No malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as previous, testing library interactions with static queries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network requests with static data, no dynamic or untrusted input.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is a standard test suite.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate testing code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (slightly elevated but justified given network activity).\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated (around 0.1 to 0.2) due to network activity, but overall low.\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the detailed analysis, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal, due to external network interactions with static queries, no user input or dynamic code execution)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured test suite for a known open-source library interacting with a public endpoint. It poses no supply chain or malware risk.",
