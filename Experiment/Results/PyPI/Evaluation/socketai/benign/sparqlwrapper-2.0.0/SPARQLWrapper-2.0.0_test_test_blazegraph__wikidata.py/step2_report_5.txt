  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**  \n- All reports indicate that the code is a set of unit tests for the SPARQLWrapper library against a public endpoint (Wikidata).  \n- The queries are static, hardcoded strings with no user input or dynamic data.  \n- The code does not execute any system commands, handle secrets, or include obfuscated/malicious code.  \n- No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident.\n\n**2. Data Flows and Sinks:**  \n- The data flows from predefined queries into network requests to the endpoint.  \n- Responses are parsed into XML or RDF graphs.  \n- No untrusted input is incorporated at runtime, reducing injection risk.\n\n**3. External Libraries & Usage:**  \n- Uses standard libraries (`rdflib`, `SPARQLWrapper`) in typical, safe ways.  \n- No indication of malicious use or vulnerabilities in their usage.\n\n**4. Anomalies & Security Concerns:**  \n- The only anomalies are the extensive use of `unittest.skip()` for unsupported formats, which is standard practice.  \n- The `sleep()` call is benign, intended to prevent server overload.  \n- Exception handling is limited to printing error messages; no dangerous code execution is present.\n\n**5. Response & Behavior:**  \n- All responses are verified for expected content types and parsed formats.  \n- The tests are designed to validate library behavior, not to process untrusted data dynamically.\n\n**6. Confidence & Scores Justification:**  \n- Based on the detailed review, there is **no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent**.  \n- The code is a standard test suite, with static data, no dynamic or external input influencing execution.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Score Type        | Estimated Value | Justification                                                                                  |\n|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**      | **0**           | No malicious code, backdoors, or harmful payloads detected.                                |\n| **Obfuscated**   | **0**           | Code is clear, well-structured, and straightforward.                                          |\n| **Risk**         | **0**           | No active vulnerabilities or malicious activities.                                            |\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite for the SPARQLWrapper library, targeting a public endpoint with static queries. It contains no malicious or sabotage elements, and the security risk is negligible.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis or a different focus is required.",
