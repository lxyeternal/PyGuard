{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for the SPARQLWrapper library, executing static queries against a public Wikidata SPARQL endpoint to verify correct behavior and response formats.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from predefined, static SPARQL query strings embedded within the script.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests sent to the endpoint with static query data; responses are parsed into XML, RDF graphs, or JSON formats.",
  "flows": "Static queries are set via setQuery(), then sent through network requests (GET or POST), with responses processed into specific data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic input handling. Use of sleep() and exception handling are benign and standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static, controlled network requests with predefined queries, verifying response content types and parsing results. No user input or untrusted data is involved. External libraries are used normally, and no malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. Exception handling is straightforward, and test skips indicate known limitations, not malicious intent. The network interactions are part of standard testing activities, with no signs of sabotage or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite with no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The minimal security risk stems from network activity, which is controlled and static. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are justified.",
