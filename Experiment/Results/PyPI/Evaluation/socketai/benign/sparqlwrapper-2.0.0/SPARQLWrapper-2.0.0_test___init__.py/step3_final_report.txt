  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources include environment variables, file reads, network calls, and user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmissions, file writes, system commands, eval/exec calls, and environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or system modifications), possibly via dynamic code execution or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious patterns such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, eval/exec with untrusted data, network activity to suspicious domains, or unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high suspicion when it involves eval/exec with untrusted input, obfuscation, or network activity to malicious domains. Benign code lacks these indicators. The scores should reflect the presence or absence of these signals. Report 2's obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent, warranting higher malware and risk scores. Report 4's explicit malicious indicators justify high scores. Other reports show minimal or no suspicious features, justifying low scores.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their scores. Report 2's malware score should be increased from 0.4 to 0.6 to better match its suspicious patterns. Report 4's high scores are justified. Overall, the scores align with the described behaviors, with slight adjustments recommended for Report 2.",
