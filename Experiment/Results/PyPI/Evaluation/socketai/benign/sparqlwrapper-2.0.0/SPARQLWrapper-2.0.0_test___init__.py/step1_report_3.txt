{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility script for data processing, possibly related to file handling and simple calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, standard input, and file system (e.g., open(), os.environ).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files and outputs to standard output (print). No suspicious network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or file input → processing functions → output via print or file writing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard library functions and common constructs. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input data from environment variables and files, processes the data with basic functions, and outputs results. No use of dangerous functions such as eval(), exec(), or subprocess calls. The logic is straightforward, with no indication of malicious intent. The absence of network operations, credential theft mechanisms, or system modifications supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data processing script without malicious behavior. No security risks or malware signs are evident. It maintains proper data handling without suspicious activity.",
