{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the 'kiss_headers' library, specifically testing the 'Header' class functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string inputs and constants within test methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Input data (hardcoded strings) flow into the 'Header' class constructor, but do not lead to any untrusted sink or external system.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward unit testing without any dynamic execution, network operations, or data handling that could pose security risks. All inputs are hardcoded within the test suite, and there are no external data sources or outputs that could be exploited. The structure adheres to standard testing practices without suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign set of unit tests for a header parsing library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks. It appears to be a safe, standard testing script.",
