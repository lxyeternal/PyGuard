  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'Header' class from 'kiss_headers', verifying header parsing and attribute access with static, hardcoded data.",
  "sources": "Static header strings within test cases, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "In-memory assertions and comparisons; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; static data used solely for testing purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. JSON payloads are static test data, not malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite with static, hardcoded header strings. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. The tests verify header parsing, attribute access, and equality comparisons. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.05-0.1), reflecting the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test suite with no security concerns. The current scores are appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.",
