  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'kiss_headers' Header class, validating its functionality and behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from test cases, including header names, header values, and assertions on the Header object.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks, code injection, or malicious actions; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Test data flows from test input into Header instances, with assertions checking attribute access and comparisons. No external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected. The code is standard unit test implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a 'kiss_headers' module, then defines several unit tests to validate the Header class. The tests cover attribute access, equality comparisons, and iteration behavior. All data used is static, test-related, and does not involve external or untrusted inputs. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for a header parsing class, with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for testing the correctness of the Header class.",
