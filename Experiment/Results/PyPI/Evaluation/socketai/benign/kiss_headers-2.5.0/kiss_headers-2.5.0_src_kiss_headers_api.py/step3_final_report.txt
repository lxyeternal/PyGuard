  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for parsing, decoding, transforming, and explaining email and HTTP headers from various input formats, including JSON, bytes, strings, and response objects.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include JSON strings, bytes, byte streams, email.Message objects, mappings, and HTTP response objects.",
  "sinks": "Header objects, JSON serialization, class transformations, and internal data structures; no network or system modification occurs.",
  "flows": "Input data is decoded and transformed through functions like decode_partials and transform_possible_encoded, then headers are constructed or manipulated, with optional JSON encoding.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional use of __class__ reassignment for polymorphism; reliance on external utility functions whose implementations are not provided; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code handles multiple input types robustly, decoding headers safely, and transforming data into Header and Headers objects. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or obfuscation are evident. The class reassignment is a known pattern for polymorphism, not malicious obfuscation. External functions could be a concern if malicious, but their absence here suggests no immediate risk. The overall structure is clean, well-documented, and purpose-driven.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured header parsing utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score reflects the complexity but not malicious intent.",
