  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of utility functions for header parsing, normalization, decoding, and class-to-header conversions.\n- No external network calls, system modifications, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The functions handle data safely, using standard Python libraries like `re`, `email.header`, and `json`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The functions process untrusted input data but do so via safe parsing and decoding routines.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The reviewer finds no malicious intent, obfuscation, or malware. The code is safe, well-structured, and standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** The low risk score aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe use of standard libraries and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** Again, appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Also concludes no malicious activity, standard utility functions, safe processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior, safe handling.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) but still very low, reflecting minor uncertainty but no concrete evidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion: safe, standard utility functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Justification:** Same reasoning as above.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis—no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the utility nature of the code and absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a well-structured, standard utility library for header processing with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or high security risk.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (matching the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' assessments are accurate and justified based on the code content.",
