  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing, normalizing, decoding, and validating email or HTTP headers, as well as class-to-header conversions and comment extraction.",
  "sources": "Input headers, header content strings, class attributes, and header key-value pairs.",
  "sinks": "Header validation functions, decoding routines, and class lookups that process untrusted header data.",
  "flows": "Header strings are split, decoded, validated, and mapped to classes; data flows from raw input through parsing functions to structured outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; functions perform standard parsing and validation.",
  "analysis": "The code relies solely on standard Python libraries for string manipulation, regex, and email header decoding. It performs safe operations such as splitting headers, decoding encoded words, validating header names, and mapping class names to header strings. No external network calls, code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The functions are designed for header processing in email or HTTP contexts, with proper handling of edge cases and RFC compliance. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2) are justified given the utility nature of the code and the absence of vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility library for header parsing and validation, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware and obfuscated scores are 0, and the low risk scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
