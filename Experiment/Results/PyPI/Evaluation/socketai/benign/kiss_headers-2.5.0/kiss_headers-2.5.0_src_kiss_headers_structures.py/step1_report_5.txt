  "purpose": "Implementation of a case-insensitive dictionary, primarily for headers or similar key-value data structures.",
  "sources": "Input data in the constructor, updates via update method, and keys set through __setitem__.",
  "sinks": "Accessing and retrieving data via __getitem__, __iter__, and lower_items methods.",
  "flows": "Input data -> update/init -> stored in _store with normalized keys -> retrieval via __getitem__ or iteration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious behavior; the code is a standard implementation of a case-insensitive dict-like structure.",
  "analysis": "The class provides a case-insensitive dict by normalizing keys on set and get operations, storing original keys for display. It uses standard Python data structures and methods without executing or interpreting untrusted input beyond dictionary key normalization. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity is present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are detected. The code's structure is clear, and the functionality is straightforward, primarily for case-insensitive header management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a case-insensitive dictionary with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
