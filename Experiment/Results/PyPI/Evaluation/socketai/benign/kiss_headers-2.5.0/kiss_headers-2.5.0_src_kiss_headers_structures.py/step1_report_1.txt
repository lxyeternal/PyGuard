  "purpose": "Implement a case-insensitive dictionary-like object for handling headers or similar data structures, with normalizations and custom behaviors.",
  "sources": "Initialization (__init__), item setting (__setitem__), item retrieval (__getitem__), deletion (__delitem__), and copying (copy). These are the main points where data is read or stored.",
  "sinks": "Data is stored in an internal OrderedDict and returned via __getitem__ and __iter__, but there are no direct sinks that transmit untrusted data externally or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Input data is normalized and stored internally. Retrieval and iteration flow from internal store to user-visible outputs. No external data flows or harmful data processing are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. The class appears to be a standard implementation of a case-insensitive dict with normalized keys. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom dictionary class that handles string keys in a case-insensitive manner by normalizing keys with the 'normalize_str' function. The class supports standard dict operations, including update, copy, and iteration. The internal storage uses an OrderedDict, storing actual keys alongside values to preserve original casing. The methods operate purely within safe data structures; no external network, file, or environment interactions are performed. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present. The purpose appears to be benign, aiding in handling HTTP headers or similar data case-insensitively.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard, well-documented case-insensitive dictionary with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as a data container without external communication or secret access. Overall, it appears safe and purpose-driven.",
