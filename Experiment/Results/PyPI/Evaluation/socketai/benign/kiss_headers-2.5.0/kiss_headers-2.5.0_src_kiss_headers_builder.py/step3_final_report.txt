{
  "purpose": "The code provides a comprehensive set of classes for HTTP headers, including validation, encoding, and utility methods, aimed at constructing and managing HTTP request and response headers securely and correctly.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to class constructors, external utility functions (quote, unquote, header_content_split), and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Header attribute assignments, string formatting, encoding functions, and validation routines.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → validation and encoding functions → class attribute assignment and header string construction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. External utilities are assumed standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured, uses standard Python libraries for validation and encoding, and performs thorough validation of inputs such as email, URL, and header values. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or file operations are present. The validation routines and encoding functions are typical for secure header handling. External utility functions (quote, unquote, header_content_split) are presumed to be standard and secure. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident. The overall design aligns with best practices for HTTP header management, with no suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented library for HTTP header creation and validation, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), primarily due to reliance on external utilities which are assumed secure. The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis and the benign nature of the code.",
