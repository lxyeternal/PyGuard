{
  "purpose": "The code defines various classes representing HTTP headers for use in web security, request, and response handling. It provides utilities for creating, parsing, and managing HTTP headers for security policies, cookies, authorization, and other HTTP features.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from constructor parameters, class attributes, and methods such as header content, URL, email validation, datetime objects, and string manipulations. No external or untrusted sources are explicitly read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "Data is formatted into HTTP header strings, some methods perform encoding/decoding (e.g., base64 for Authorization), URL encoding/decoding for filenames, and datetime formatting. Potential sink points include header string construction and decoding functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor inputs (parameters) through validation and encoding steps into header attribute strings. Some flows include encoding credentials (BasicAuth), URL encoding filenames, and datetime formatting. No external network calls or system modifications occur directly within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard Python libraries for encoding, decoding, validation, and formatting. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are evident. No obfuscation, malicious dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors are present. No external malicious calls or system modifications are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for HTTP headers with validation, encoding, and formatting logic. It validates inputs such as email addresses, URL components, and header values. Encoding methods (base64, URL) are standard and correctly implemented. No suspicious external dependencies or hidden behaviors are identified. Functions perform expected operations for HTTP header management, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured set of HTTP header classes for security and request/response management. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malicious data exfiltration. It solely provides utilities for safe header creation and parsing. Overall, it is a benign library focused on HTTP header manipulation.",
