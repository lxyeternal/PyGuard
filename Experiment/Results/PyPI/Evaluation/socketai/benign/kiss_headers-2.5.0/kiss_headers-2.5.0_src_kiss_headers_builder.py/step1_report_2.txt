{
  "purpose": "This code defines a collection of HTTP header classes for use in a web request/response context, allowing for structured and type-safe manipulation of headers in Python applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, class attributes, and instance variables such as header values and configurations provided during object initialization.",
  "sinks": "Header values are assigned to internal attributes and could be used to inject malicious data if constructed improperly; however, no direct external sinks like network calls or file writes are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user-supplied parameters through class constructors into header attribute values, but there are no dynamic or external data flows like network or database interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variables. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. There are no backdoors, malicious network calls, or data exfiltration logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive implementation of various HTTP headers, with validation and formatting logic to ensure correctness. It uses standard library functions for date formatting and URL quoting. There are no indications of malicious intent; all functions serve legitimate purposes related to HTTP header management. The code is well-structured, with validation to prevent invalid header values, and does not include any network or file system operations that could be malicious. No suspicious behaviors such as code injection, data leakage, or malicious data processing are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate, well-structured collection of HTTP header classes intended for secure and correct HTTP communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this code segment.",
