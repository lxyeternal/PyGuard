  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented library for HTTP header creation and validation, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), primarily due to reliance on external utilities which are assumed secure. The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis and the benign nature of the code."
