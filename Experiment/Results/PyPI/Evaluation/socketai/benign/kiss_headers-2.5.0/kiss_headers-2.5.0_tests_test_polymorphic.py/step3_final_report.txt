{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test that parses HTTP headers and verifies content type extraction using the kiss_headers library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from a static header string passed to parse_it() and headers.content_type.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data flows from parsed headers into get_polymorphic() and subsequent method calls.",
  "flows": "Header string -> parse_it() -> get_polymorphic() -> get_charset()/get_mime()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Exception handling for TypeError is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward header parsing and type validation with assertions. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious patterns are present. The functions used are standard for header processing. The exception handling tests type safety but does not indicate malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test for HTTP header parsing. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
