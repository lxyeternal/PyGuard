  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Correctly identifies the code as a package init file for header handling.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data handling or suspicious flows.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis: The code is straightforward, importing modules and defining __all__.\n- Conclusion: Benign, standard package setup.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above, clearly a package module.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No untrusted data handling.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No malicious patterns or suspicious behaviors.\n- Conclusion: Benign, standard structure.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Similar, package for header utilities.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external or dangerous operations.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard import/export code, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No suspicious data handling.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical package setup code.\n- Conclusion: Benign.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same, utility package for headers.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external input processing or output.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: No signs of malicious code.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code in question is a standard `__init__.py` for a Python package that imports modules and defines exports.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated elements are present.\n- No external data flows, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are evident.\n- The malware score should be **0**, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score should be **0**, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The risk score should be **0**, given the benign nature.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews and the code's content.",
