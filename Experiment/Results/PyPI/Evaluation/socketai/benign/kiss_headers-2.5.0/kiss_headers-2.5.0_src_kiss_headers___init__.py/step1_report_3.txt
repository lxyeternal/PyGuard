{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python module for handling HTTP and IMAP4 headers, providing functions, classes, and constants for parsing, building, and serializing headers.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.api, .builder, .models, .serializer, .version) and the module's __all__ declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or sensitive operations are present; no network or file operations are included in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines imports and exports without processing external input or performing data flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be standard module definition with clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python package module, importing various components from internal modules and exposing them via __all__. There are no code execution, data processing, or network operations performed here. It lacks any dynamic code evaluation, hardcoded secrets, or other indicators of malicious intent. The use of __future__ import is standard for compatibility. Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python module for HTTP/IMAP header handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It is safe based on the content reviewed.",
