{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package for handling HTTP and IMAP4 headers with utility functions, classes, and modules for parsing, constructing, and serializing headers.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.api, .builder, .models, .serializer, .version); no external data inputs or environment variables are directly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or system commands; the code primarily performs imports, class definitions, and exposes public API functions and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code initializes modules and exports symbols, with no runtime data processing or external command execution present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code constructs, such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. No backdoors or hidden behaviors detected. The import statements and API definitions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a well-structured Python package module that imports various submodules and defines its public API via __all__. There are no signs of malicious payloads, such as network connections, file modifications, or code injection. The only operations are imports, constant definitions, and module exports, which are typical for package initialization. The license and author comments are standard and do not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on a thorough review, the code appears to be benign, standard package setup code without malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a header handling utility library, with no indicators of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
