{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package for handling HTTP and IMAP headers, providing utility functions, data models, and header builders.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and components from local package files (.api, .builder, .models, etc.), and standard future import.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external interactions; no network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "The package primarily imports modules and exposes functions/classes, with no data flow involving untrusted inputs or external systems within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the code appears to be standard package setup and interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, module metadata, and the __all__ declaration for exports. There are no runtime data processing, network calls, or environment manipulations present. It adheres to common Python package structure without any signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, focusing on defining and exposing header handling utilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign Python package setup with no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. It is a standard package interface file that imports components and declares exports. No malicious or malicious-sounding patterns are present.",
