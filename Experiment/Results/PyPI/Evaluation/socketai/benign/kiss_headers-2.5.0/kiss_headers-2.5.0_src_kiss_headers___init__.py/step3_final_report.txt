{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the __init__.py for a Python package that provides utilities for handling HTTP and IMAP4 headers, exposing various classes and functions for parsing and building headers.",
  "sources": "The code sources are static import statements and the module-level __all__ declaration; no external input or untrusted data is processed.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only defines imports and exports.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code is purely structural and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initialization module (__init__.py) that imports internal modules and defines the public API via __all__. It contains no runtime data processing, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. The structure is typical for Python packages, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured package setup file with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk.",
