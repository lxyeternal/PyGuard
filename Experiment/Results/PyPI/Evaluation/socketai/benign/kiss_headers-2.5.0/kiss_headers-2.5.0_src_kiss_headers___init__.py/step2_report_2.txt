  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a package init file (__init__.py) that imports modules and defines __all__. No external data handling or dynamic code execution.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows from untrusted sources; primarily imports and exports.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign package setup script for a header utility library.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the straightforward structure, no malicious activity, and standard imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also a standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: imports, __all__, no dynamic or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Again, a typical __init__.py for a Python package, no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None detected. The code is a standard package initialization script.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent; no external input processing, no code execution, no secrets.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any suspicious activity, the overall risk score should be **0**.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis is based solely on static code review.\n- The code does not perform any runtime operations that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, safe package initialization script with no malicious or security issues.\n- Scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the thorough review of all reports.",
