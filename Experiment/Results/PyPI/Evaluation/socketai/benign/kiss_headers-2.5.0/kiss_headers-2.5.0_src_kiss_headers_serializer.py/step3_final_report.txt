  "purpose": "Functions for encoding and decoding header objects to and from dictionary formats for serialization.",
  "sources": "Header objects in the headers list, encoded_headers dictionary in decode function.",
  "sinks": "None; no external system calls, network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "headers list -> encode() -> result dict; encoded_headers dict -> decode() -> Headers object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data transformation with validation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard serialization/deserialization of header data with input validation. No external system calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution. Header and Headers classes are external but appear to be simple data containers. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The functions handle data safely, raising errors on malformed input. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. Minor variation in securityRisk score (0.1) in one report is overly cautious; overall, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation for header serialization/deserialization with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code. Scores should remain at 0 for malware and obfuscation, with a very low security risk score (preferably 0).",
