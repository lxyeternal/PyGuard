{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encode and decode header data structures for serialization and deserialization, specifically converting headers to and from dictionary formats.",
  "sources": "The functions read header objects from the input arguments, and data from encoded header dictionaries during decoding.",
  "sinks": "The code processes data into dictionaries and modifies Header objects, but does not perform any unsafe system or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input header objects -> encoding to dicts (encode) -> decoding from dicts back to headers (decode).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or suspicious data handling observed. No external system interaction or sensitive data leakage evident.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly handles data transformation for headers with straightforward logic. It does not perform any external network operations, system modifications, or include suspicious code. The logic for encoding and decoding headers is standard. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or security risks identified. The functions raise exceptions for malformed input during decoding, which is normal for data validation. The code's purpose appears to be serialization/deserialization of header data, with no indication of malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard header encoding and decoding utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It is safe for use in a larger project.",
