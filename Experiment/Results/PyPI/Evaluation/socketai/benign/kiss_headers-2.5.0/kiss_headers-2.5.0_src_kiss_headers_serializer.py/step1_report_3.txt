{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encode and decode HTTP headers for serialization and deserialization.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the 'headers' parameter in encode() and the 'encoded_headers' parameter in decode().",
  "sinks": "Data is stored in dictionaries and objects; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Headers are read from input objects and transformed into serializable dictionaries in encode(); encoded dictionaries are parsed and reconstructed into header objects in decode().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code performs standard serialization/deserialization of header objects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: encode() converts header objects into nested dictionaries for serialization, and decode() reconstructs header objects from such dictionaries. Both functions perform standard data transformations with validation checks. No external data sources or sinks, network calls, or system modifications are present. The logic appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials, code injection, or privacy violations are evident. The functions handle data structures cautiously and include validation to prevent malformed input processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured header serialization utility without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network communication, system modifications, or sensitive data handling beyond headers. No signs of malware or security threats detected.",
