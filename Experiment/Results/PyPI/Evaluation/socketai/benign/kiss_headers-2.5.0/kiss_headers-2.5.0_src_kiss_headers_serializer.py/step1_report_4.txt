{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encode and decode header objects into a dictionary format suitable for serialization and deserialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'headers' input parameter in encode() and encoded_headers dictionary in decode().",
  "sinks": "The code modifies Header objects and creates dictionaries for output; no untrusted data sinks like network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input headers are transformed into dictionaries in encode(), and encoded dictionaries are parsed back into Header objects in decode().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network access. No unusual data handling or privacy violations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly encodes and decodes header data structures without executing external commands or handling untrusted data sources beyond normal data transformation. The functions process data internally with no network, file, or system command interactions. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The only potential concern could be if the Header or Headers classes have malicious implementations, but based solely on this code, the data transformations are straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code performs data serialization and deserialization for header objects in a standard way without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and intended for normal use within a larger application context.",
