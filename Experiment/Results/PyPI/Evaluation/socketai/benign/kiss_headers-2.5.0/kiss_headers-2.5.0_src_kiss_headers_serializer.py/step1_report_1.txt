  "purpose": "Encode and decode header objects for serialization and deserialization of header data.",
  "sources": "Input data from the 'headers' parameter in encode() and the 'encoded_headers' parameter in decode(), which are supplied externally.",
  "sinks": "The code mainly processes data structures; potential sinks could involve writing data to external systems if integrated elsewhere, but within this snippet, no direct external sink is present.",
  "flows": "Headers are read from input parameters; processed and transformed into dictionaries (encode) or from dictionaries into Header objects (decode). There are no external data transmissions or actions beyond data transformation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code uses standard data processing patterns, with no obfuscated or misleading code. No security-sensitive operations like executing dynamic code or network communication are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward serialization and deserialization of header objects. It involves typical data structures: lists and dictionaries. No input validation beyond type checks, and no external data access or output occurs. The logic appears standard and safe. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The functions only manipulate data structures in memory, following expected patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for encoding and decoding headers with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain malicious payloads.",
