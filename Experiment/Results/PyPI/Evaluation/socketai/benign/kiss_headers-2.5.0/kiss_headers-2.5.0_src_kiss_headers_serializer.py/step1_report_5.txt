{
  "purpose": "The code encodes and decodes header objects for serialization and deserialization purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the headers parameter in encode() and from encoded_headers dictionary in decode().",
  "sinks": "Data is stored in dictionaries and Header objects; no direct sink for untrusted data beyond data storage.",
  "flows": "Headers input -> encode() processes headers -> outputs dict; encoded_headers input -> decode() -> Headers object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution or network activities.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward serialization and deserialization of header objects. It processes input data into a dictionary structure and reconstructs header objects from this structure. The logic is simple, with explicit type checks and data handling. No indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code relies on class Header and Headers, which are not detailed here, but based on usage, they appear to be standard data containers. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard serialization/deserialization of header data with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility module.",
