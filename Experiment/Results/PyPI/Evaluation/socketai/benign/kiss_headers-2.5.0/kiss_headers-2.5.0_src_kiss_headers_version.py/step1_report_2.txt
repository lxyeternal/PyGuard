  "purpose": "Define and expose the version of the module",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string from a hardcoded variable '__version__'",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or output",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only static data is used",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected; the code is straightforward and minimal",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string '__version__' and creates a 'VERSION' list by splitting this string. It uses a standard pattern for exposing version info, with no dynamic or external data inputs. No obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard, and safe. It solely defines version information without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
