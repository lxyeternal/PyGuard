  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; simple assignment and string operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and splits it into a list. The use of __future__ import is standard and does not introduce any security issues. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, or external data handling. The code's purpose is solely to define version information, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, harmless, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
