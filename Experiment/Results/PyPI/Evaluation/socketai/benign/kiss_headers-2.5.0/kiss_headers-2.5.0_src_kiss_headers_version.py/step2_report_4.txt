  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the code and its implications.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code imports `annotations` from `__future__` for compatibility.\n- Defines a string `__version__ = \"2.5.0\"`.\n- Creates a list `VERSION` by splitting the version string.\n- The code is minimal, static, and does not process external data or perform any I/O.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is straightforward and contains no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **External data handling:** None.\n- **Code complexity:** Very minimal, standard pattern for version declaration.\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**  \nAll describe the code as a benign, standard pattern for exposing version info. They agree that there are no anomalies, no external data flows, and no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **malware:** 0 — consistent and justified.\n- **obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **securityRisk:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes, all are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:** The code only defines version info; no dynamic or external inputs are involved.\n- **Risk assessment:** Since the code is static and harmless, a risk score higher than 0.1 is unwarranted.\n- **Malware score:** Should remain 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration pattern with no security concerns. All reports correctly identify this. No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects the code's harmless nature.",
