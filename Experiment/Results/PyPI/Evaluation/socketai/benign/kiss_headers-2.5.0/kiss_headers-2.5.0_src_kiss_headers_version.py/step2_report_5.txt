  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nExpose version\n\"\"\"\n\nfrom __future__ import annotations\n\n__version__ = \"2.5.0\"\nVERSION = __version__.split(\".\")\n```\n\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for defining and exposing version info.\n- No external inputs, no data sinks, no dynamic code execution.\n- No obfuscation, no suspicious constructs.\n- The use of `__future__.annotations` is a standard practice for forward compatibility and does not introduce security issues.\n\n**Assessment of Reports:**\n\nAll five reports concur that the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. They correctly identify that the code only defines version information, with no external data handling or suspicious logic.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of external inputs or security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Potential Issues or Misinterpretations:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. There are no claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions.\n- The code's purpose is solely to define and expose version info, which is inherently safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the code and reports, I agree with the assessments. The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed; the reports are accurate and consistent.",
