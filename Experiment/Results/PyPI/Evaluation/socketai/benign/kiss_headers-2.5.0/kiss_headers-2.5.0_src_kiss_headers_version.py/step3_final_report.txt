  "purpose": "Define and expose the package version information in a static, straightforward manner.",
  "sources": "The static string '__version__' and the import from __future__ for annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process external inputs or data flows.",
  "flows": "None; no data flows from sources to sinks as there are no external data interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is minimal, static, and free of suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static declaration of version information with no external data handling, dynamic execution, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. The code does not perform any malicious activity or security-sensitive operations, and the assessments are consistent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for exposing version info with no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
