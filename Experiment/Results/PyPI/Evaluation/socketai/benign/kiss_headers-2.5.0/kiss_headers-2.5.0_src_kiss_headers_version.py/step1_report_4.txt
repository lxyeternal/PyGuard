  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is simple and standard for exposing version info.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and splits it into a list for potential use elsewhere. No input/output, no external data reading, no suspicious logic. It uses standard Python syntax with no obfuscation or hidden behavior. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network or system calls.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to define and expose version info. There are no malicious or security-threatening elements. The code is simple, standard, and safe.",
