{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for performing discrete cosine transforms (DCT) and inverse DCT (IDCT) on tensors, supporting 1D, 2D, and 3D transformations, primarily for signal or image processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input tensors (t) provided as function arguments. It also accesses scipy.fft for generating DCT/IDCT matrices.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that could leak information or perform unsafe actions. No outputs or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are transformed using precomputed DCT/IDCT matrices; matrices are computed from scipy.fft functions and then used in einsum operations to transform the data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code uses caching decorators appropriately. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard mathematical and library functions to compute DCT/IDCT matrices and apply transformations on tensors. Functions are well-structured, with caching to optimize repeated computations. No external data sources or network operations are involved. All operations are mathematical, without any data leakage, code injection, or malicious intent. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of DCT and IDCT transformations using PyTorch and SciPy, intended for signal processing tasks. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
