  "purpose": "The code provides functions for computing discrete cosine transform (DCT) and inverse DCT (IDCT) matrices and applying these transforms to tensors, supporting 1D, 2D, and 3D data.",
  "sources": "Libraries imported: torch, scipy. Function parameters for device and dtype, which are inputs for tensor computations.",
  "sinks": "Tensor operations with torch.einsum and tensor creation with torch.tensor. No external data output or network calls observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input tensors through DCT/IDCT matrix computations, then applies tensor contractions to produce transformed tensors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. Use of lru_cache for caching matrices is standard. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements mathematical transformations using well-known libraries (scipy and torch) with standard tensor operations. The functions generate orthogonal DCT/IDCT matrices and apply them via tensor contractions. Usage of caching improves efficiency without security concerns. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present; the code appears to be for legitimate numerical processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of DCT and IDCT transformations for tensors, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It appears to be intended for signal or image processing tasks.",
