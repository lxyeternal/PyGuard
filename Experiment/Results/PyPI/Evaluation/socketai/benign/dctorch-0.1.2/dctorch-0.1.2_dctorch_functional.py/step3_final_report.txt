  "purpose": "Implementations of discrete cosine transform (DCT) and inverse DCT for tensors, optimized with caching for repeated computations.",
  "sources": "scipy.fft.dct and scipy.fft.idct functions, tensor shape attributes, device and dtype parameters",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data transmission or file/network I/O present",
  "flows": "Input tensors are transformed via matrix multiplication with precomputed DCT/IDCT matrices; matrices are cached for efficiency",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard DCT/IDCT transformations using scipy and torch, with caching for efficiency. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. Use of lru_cache for matrices is appropriate. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected. The functions operate purely on tensors, with clear mathematical intent. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, standard signal processing purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of DCT/IDCT transforms with no malicious or security concerns. It is safe, transparent, and free of suspicious behavior.",
