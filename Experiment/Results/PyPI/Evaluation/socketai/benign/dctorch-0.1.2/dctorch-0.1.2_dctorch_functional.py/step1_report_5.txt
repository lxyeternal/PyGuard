  "purpose": "The code provides functions for computing discrete cosine transform (DCT) and inverse DCT (IDCT) matrices and applying them to tensors, supporting 1D, 2D, and 3D transformations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input tensors (t) and uses scipy.fft to generate DCT and IDCT matrices, caching these matrices for reuse.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted input data in a manner that could cause security issues or data leakage. No data output to external systems is present.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are transformed via matrix multiplication with DCT/IDCT matrices. Computation relies on predefined scipy functions and tensor operations without external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The functions are standard mathematical transformations with caching for efficiency.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common scientific libraries (torch, scipy, numpy) to perform DCT and IDCT computations, including functions for 1D, 2D, and 3D transforms. It employs caching to optimize matrix computations, which are generated using scipy.fft functions and converted to torch tensors. The functions are purely mathematical and do not include network operations, file I/O, or external communications. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be well-structured, standard, and consistent with typical scientific computing code.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard mathematical transformations for signal processing without any malicious intent or security risks. It is safe from a security perspective and lacks suspicious or malicious behavior. No malware or malicious code is present.",
