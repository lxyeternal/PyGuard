{
  "purpose": "The code implements Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Inverse DCT (IDCT) functions for tensors, likely for signal or image processing tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads tensor data passed as arguments to the functions, as well as external libraries (torch, scipy.fft, numpy). It also uses lru_cache to cache computed matrices based on input parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write untrusted data to external systems or perform data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are processed through compute_dct_mat and compute_idct_mat functions, which generate transformation matrices from scipy.fft; these matrices are then used in einsum operations to compute DCT/IDCT transforms.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. Usage of standard libraries for mathematical transformations is typical and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to compute DCT and IDCT matrices, caching them for efficiency. These matrices are generated using scipy.fft functions on identity matrices. The transform functions apply these matrices via torch.einsum to perform tensor transformations for various dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D). All operations rely on standard numerical methods and library functions. No external data is read from or written to external sources, nor are there any signs of malicious code such as network activity, data leakage, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of DCT/IDCT transforms for tensors, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It leverages common numerical methods and caches computations efficiently. Overall, it is safe.",
