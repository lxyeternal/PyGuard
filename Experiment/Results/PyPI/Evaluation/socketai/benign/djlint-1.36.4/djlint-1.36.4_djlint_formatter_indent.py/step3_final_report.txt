  "purpose": "Code formatting utility for HTML and templates, with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Regex-based parsing and transformations within the code; no external data or network operations.",
  "sinks": "No external system calls or data leaks; primarily regex substitutions and attribute formatting.",
  "flows": "Input code is processed through regex substitutions, attribute formatting, and indentation logic; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on 'contents' in 'format_data' function, which can evaluate untrusted input and pose security risks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a formatter that manipulates HTML and template code using regex and string operations. The only potentially suspicious element is the use of eval() within 'format_data' to parse or evaluate 'contents'. While eval() is confined within a try-except block and used for JSON parsing or safe evaluation, its presence on 'contents' that could be influenced by untrusted input introduces a significant security concern. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The code's structure and logic are consistent with a legitimate formatting utility, but the eval() usage warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the use of eval() on untrusted data, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited. While the code does not exhibit malicious behavior by design, this pattern introduces a high risk of supply chain exploitation. Therefore, the malware score should be set to 0.75, reflecting the potential for malicious activity due to unsafe eval() usage. The obfuscation score remains 0, as the code is clear and readable. The overall security risk score should be around 0.75, considering the eval() vulnerability. Addressing this by replacing eval() with safer parsing methods is recommended to mitigate the risk.",
