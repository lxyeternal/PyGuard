  "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the use of eval() on untrusted data, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited. While the code does not exhibit malicious behavior by design, this pattern introduces a high risk of supply chain exploitation. Therefore, the malware score should be set to 0.75, reflecting the potential for malicious activity due to unsafe eval() usage. The obfuscation score remains 0, as the code is clear and readable. The overall security risk score should be around 0.75, considering the eval() vulnerability. Addressing this by replacing eval() with safer parsing methods is recommended to mitigate the risk."
