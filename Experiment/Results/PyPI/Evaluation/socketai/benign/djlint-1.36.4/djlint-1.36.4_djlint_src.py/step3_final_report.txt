  "purpose": "Utility for collecting source files based on extension, ignoring files with specific pragmas, and respecting gitignore patterns.",
  "sources": "Reads the first line of each file to detect pragma comments; resolves file paths; matches files against extension and ignore patterns.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs; only file I/O and pattern matching within the filesystem.",
  "flows": "Source: file path resolution and reading first line; Sink: pattern matching and file collection; Flow is limited to safe filesystem operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs safe path normalization, extension filtering, and pragma detection via regex. It reads only the first line of files, which is standard for pragma comments. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. Regex patterns are used solely for pattern matching. The overall logic is straightforward and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for source file collection with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
