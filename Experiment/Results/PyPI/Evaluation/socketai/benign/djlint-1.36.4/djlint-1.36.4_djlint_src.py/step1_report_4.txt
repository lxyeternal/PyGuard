  "purpose": "The code aims to gather source files from specified paths, filtering based on extensions, gitignore, and pragma comments.",
  "sources": "Path resolution with Path.resolve(), reading the first line of files with open()",
  "sinks": "Reading file contents, globbing for files, regex matching on file content and paths",
  "flows": "Path normalization -> file opening -> regex check for pragmas -> filtering based on ignore patterns -> returning list of files",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of open() and regex matching are standard operations. No network activity or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily processes filesystem paths, reading the first line of files to detect pragma comments, and filtering files based on user-defined ignore patterns and extensions. No untrusted data is used to perform dangerous operations, and no dynamic code execution or suspicious behavior is present. The regex patterns for pragma detection are benign and used for filtering purposes. No anomalies or malicious indicators identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard file filtering utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs safe filesystem operations and content checks. No malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are apparent.",
