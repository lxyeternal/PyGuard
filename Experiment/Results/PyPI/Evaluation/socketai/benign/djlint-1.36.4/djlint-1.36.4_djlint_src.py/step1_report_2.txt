{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to gather and filter source files from given paths based on specific patterns and configurations, primarily for linting or analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "File reading occurs in the no_pragma function when opening files to check the first line for pragmas.",
  "sinks": "The file open operation in no_pragma reads the first line; the glob method retrieves files based on patterns; regex searches are performed on file paths.",
  "flows": "Source: File opening in no_pragma; Data flows from reading the first line to pattern matching. File path resolution and globbing generate file paths, which are then filtered based on regex matches and pragma presence.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It uses standard Python libraries and well-known third-party modules (click, colorama, regex). No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious side effects are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules for file handling and pattern matching. It filters source files based on path resolution and pattern exclusions, checking for specific pragmas in the first line of files. The pragma patterns are well-defined for various template languages. The function no_pragma safely reads only the first line of each file, avoiding full file reads. There is no indication of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. No suspicious or hidden functionalities are present. The code performs expected file filtering tasks with no security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical source file collection and filtering script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs pattern matching and file handling in a safe manner. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. Overall, the script appears benign.",
