  "purpose": "This code implements a HTML linter for the djlint project, performing pattern-based and module-based lint checks on HTML content.",
  "sources": "Reads input HTML content from files; imports modules based on rules.",
  "sinks": "Uses dynamic import of modules and regex pattern matching; potential for unsafe module execution if imported modules are malicious.",
  "flows": "Loads HTML content, applies regex patterns, dynamically imports rule modules, processes matches, and accumulates errors.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import of modules specified in configuration could execute malicious code if configuration is compromised. No validation or sandboxing is evident for imported modules.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs regex-based pattern matching and dynamic module imports for rule execution. The pattern matching itself appears standard. The dynamic import using importlib.import_module can execute arbitrary code if the 'python_module' value in rules is malicious or tampered with, representing a potential supply chain risk. No validation or sandboxing of imported modules is present. Other parts of the code, including regex flag parsing, line number calculation, and duplicate error filtering, are standard and do not exhibit malicious behavior. There are no signs of obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code does not perform network operations or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard HTML linter with dynamic module loading capabilities based on configuration rules. The primary security concern is the potential for malicious code execution through the 'python_module' imports if the configuration is compromised or malicious modules are supplied. Other aspects of the code do not exhibit malicious behavior or sabotage. Overall, the risk hinges on the integrity of external modules and configuration.",
