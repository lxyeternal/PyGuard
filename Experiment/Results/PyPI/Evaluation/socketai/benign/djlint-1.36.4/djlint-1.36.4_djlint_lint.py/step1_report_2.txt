{
  "purpose": "The code implements a HTML linter named Djlint, which analyzes HTML content for style and syntax issues based on configurable rules and patterns.",
  "sources": "The code reads input HTML data from the parameter 'html' in the linter() function and reads file contents in the lint_file() function.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include regex pattern matching on HTML content, which could process untrusted input; however, there are no direct data leaks or harmful actions such as network communication, file modification, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input HTML data flows from the 'html' parameter in linter() and from file reading in lint_file(). Patterns are matched via re.finditer(), and errors are collected with associated line info, but there are no dangerous sink operations involving untrusted data beyond pattern matching.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward without suspicious code anomalies. It performs standard regex pattern matching and dynamic module imports based on configuration, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script defines utility functions for building regex flags, getting line info, and performing linting based on rules, including importing external modules dynamically. It processes HTML content with regex patterns, handles ignored rules/blocks, and collects errors. The code seems to function as a typical linter without malicious logic. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The dynamic import is used for extensibility and not inherently malicious. The regex matching and file reading are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a customizable HTML linter with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It performs pattern-based analysis and handles configuration-driven rules, with no signs of malware or security threats.",
