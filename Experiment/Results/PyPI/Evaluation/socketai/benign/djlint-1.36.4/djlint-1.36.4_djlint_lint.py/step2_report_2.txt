  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a static HTML linter that uses regex pattern matching and dynamically imports rule modules based on configuration.\n- The dynamic import (`importlib.import_module`) is a common pattern for extensibility but can be a security concern if the module names are malicious or tampered with.\n- The code does not contain obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or explicit malicious payloads.\n- No network activity, file system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n- The main potential risk stems from supply chain issues—malicious modules being imported via configuration.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as an HTML linter reading files and configs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Pattern matching and dynamic imports are described accurately.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected; dynamic import is noted as a risk but standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately low security risk (0.2), malware score 0, high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is reasonable. The risk score is appropriate given the dynamic import pattern, but no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code performs pattern matching and reads files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Pattern matching is safe; no malicious actions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code anomalies; dynamic import is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Low security risk (0.2), malware 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The low malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's function.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes the potential risk of importing malicious modules.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the dynamic import as a possible supply chain risk.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly higher risk (0.4) and malware (0.1) scores, which are reasonable considering the module import risk.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned. The potential for malicious modules justifies the elevated scores compared to previous reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code's function.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Highlights the security concern of executing arbitrary code via dynamic imports.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Appropriately flags the 'importlib.import_module' as a potential vector for malicious code if the configuration is compromised.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Slightly higher scores (risk 0.3, malware 0.2) are justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with best practices. The concern about malicious modules is valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious actions, just pattern matching.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very low risk (0.1), malware 0, high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is a standard linter with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Justification & Recommendations:**\n\n- The main security concern across all reports is the dynamic import of modules specified in configuration (`python_module`). If an attacker can influence the configuration, they could potentially execute malicious code.\n- The scores reflect this concern reasonably:\n  - Low malware scores (0 or 0.1) because no malicious code is present in the static code.\n  - Slightly higher risk scores (up to 0.4) to account for supply chain risks.\n- The reports do not assume malicious intent beyond the supply chain vector, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.1 — No evidence of malicious code within the static code; the risk is external (supply chain).\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3 — Considering the dynamic import risk, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code's logic. The primary concern is supply chain integrity rather than embedded malicious code. The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe analysis confirms that the code is a standard, well-structured HTML linter with potential supply chain risks due to dynamic module imports. No malicious activity is evident, and the scoring across reports appropriately reflects this.",
