{
  "purpose": "The code is a HTML linter tool designed to analyze HTML content for stylistic and coding issues based on specified rules and patterns.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the 'html' string parameter, file content via 'this_file.read_text()', and configuration from 'config'. Uses regex patterns to identify issues.",
  "sinks": "Uses regex pattern matching to find code patterns, which could potentially be exploited if pattern inputs are malicious. However, no direct data leaks, network communications, or system modifications are observed.",
  "flows": "Input HTML data flows into regex searches and rule-based checks, with results stored in errors dictionary. No external or untrusted data sources beyond input files are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code relies on standard Python modules and follows typical patterns for a linter. No dynamic code execution or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a static analysis tool for HTML files, employing regex pattern matching and optional Python module rules. It uses standard security practices without any indication of malicious intent. The import statements are benign, and the regex flags are safely handled. There are no network calls, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation mechanisms. Error handling appears straightforward. No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate HTML linter utility that operates via pattern matching and modular rule execution. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain risks based on the provided content.",
