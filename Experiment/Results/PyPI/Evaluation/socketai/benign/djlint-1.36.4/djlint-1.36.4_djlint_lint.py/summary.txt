  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured HTML linter with a potential supply chain risk due to dynamic module imports. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The main security concern is external module integrity, which is outside the static code's scope but should be managed via secure sourcing. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a low to moderate risk score (~0.2-0.4) is appropriate."
