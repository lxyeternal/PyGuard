  "purpose": "Analyzes regex pattern matching and dynamic module imports within a Python HTML linter, highlighting potential supply chain risks associated with module sourcing.",
  "sources": "File reading, configuration-based module name specification, regex pattern matches in HTML content.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import of modules via importlib.import_module, pattern matching results used for error reporting.",
  "flows": "Configuration specifies module names -> importlib.import_module executes module -> module runs rule logic -> errors appended based on pattern matches.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected; reliance on external modules introduces potential supply chain risk.",
  "analysis": "The code performs regex-based pattern matching on HTML content and dynamically imports rule modules specified in configuration. No malicious payloads or obfuscated code are present. The primary security concern is the potential for malicious modules to be imported if configuration is compromised, which could lead to arbitrary code execution. The malware score is justified as 0, given the static code's lack of malicious content. The risk score is moderate (~0.2-0.4), reflecting the supply chain vector rather than active malicious behavior. Obfuscation is not detected. The scores across reports are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured HTML linter with a potential supply chain risk due to dynamic module imports. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The main security concern is external module integrity, which is outside the static code's scope but should be managed via secure sourcing. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a low to moderate risk score (~0.2-0.4) is appropriate.",
