  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes a standard HTML linter with dynamic rule modules, no malicious code detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; the main concern is the dynamic import of modules, which could be malicious if configuration is compromised. However, the report correctly notes this as a supply chain risk, not malicious code itself.\n- **Verdict:** The malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious code. The risk score is low, considering the potential for supply chain issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing pattern matching and dynamic imports, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Comments:** Correctly identifies the potential risk in dynamic module import but finds no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** The malware score is appropriate. The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the use of `importlib.import_module` as a potential attack vector if malicious modules are supplied.\n- **Malware score:** 0.1\n- **Risk score:** 0.4\n- **Comments:** The report recognizes the supply chain risk associated with dynamic imports but notes no actual malicious code. The malware score is slightly elevated to reflect this potential.\n- **Verdict:** The malware score seems reasonable given the identified risk. The risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—dynamic import as a potential risk, but no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.2\n- **Risk score:** 0.3\n- **Comments:** Slightly higher malware score, which is acceptable considering the potential for malicious modules.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Confirms the code as a standard linter with no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior is identified.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are either 0 or very low, which aligns with the analysis that no malicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly higher where dynamic imports are discussed, reflecting supply chain risks but not actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' reasoning.\n- The main concern is the dynamic import of modules based on configuration, which could be exploited if malicious modules are supplied. However, this is a common pattern in extendable tools, not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to potential supply chain risk in module import, but not active malicious behavior)\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and their reasoning.",
