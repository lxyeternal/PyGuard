{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point to invoke the 'djlint' module's main function from the command line using Python.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'main' function from the 'djlint' package when executed as the main module.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function call may execute code within the 'djlint' package, potentially processing input or arguments, but no direct untrusted data handling is visible here.",
  "flows": "The script imports 'main' from 'djlint' and then calls 'main()' when run as a script; the data flow depends entirely on 'djlint.main', which is not shown.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple entry point that imports and executes the 'main' function from the 'djlint' package. There are no suspicious or malicious code elements. It does not contain any embedded malicious behavior itself but relies on the contents of 'djlint.main' for functionality. The import statement is safe and standard, and the use of '__future__.annotations' is a common practice to enable postponed evaluation of annotations. No external input is read directly in this snippet, and there are no sinks or flows indicating malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign script acting as a launcher for the 'djlint' tool. It does not contain malware or security risks itself. The security assessment of the package depends on the contents of 'djlint', which is not provided here.",
