{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a command-line entry point that delegates execution to the 'djlint' package by calling its main() function when run as a script.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports 'main' from 'djlint' when executed.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: script execution triggers the import of 'main' from 'djlint' and then calls 'main()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI launcher that imports and executes 'djlint.main()'. It contains no untrusted data handling, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. The use of '__future__.annotations' is standard and does not introduce security issues. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this script, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The actual security implications depend on 'djlint.main()', which is outside this snippet. Overall, the code is safe and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary based on this snippet.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
