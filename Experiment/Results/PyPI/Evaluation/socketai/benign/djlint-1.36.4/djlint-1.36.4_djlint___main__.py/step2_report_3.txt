  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is minimal, straightforward, and acts as a command-line launcher for the 'djlint' package.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or flows involving user input are present in the code.\n- The import of 'djlint.main' and invocation of 'main()' is standard practice.\n- The use of '__future__.annotations' is a common compatibility feature.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the actual security or malicious behavior depends on the 'djlint.main()' implementation, which is outside the scope of this snippet.\n- The code itself does not process data, handle secrets, or execute dynamic code beyond calling 'main()'.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code in this snippet.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- The security risk score is 0, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Potential Issues or Misjudgments:**\n- Since the code is purely a launcher, any security concerns would originate from 'djlint.main()' or the environment, not from this script itself.\n- The reports' confidence levels are all 1, which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\nThis code acts solely as a simple CLI entry point, and the security implications depend entirely on the 'djlint' package's implementation, which is not included here.",
