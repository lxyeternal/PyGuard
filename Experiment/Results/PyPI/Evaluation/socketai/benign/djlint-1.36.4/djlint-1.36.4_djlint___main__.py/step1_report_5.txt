{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point to run the 'djlint' tool via Python, allowing command-line access through module invocation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__main__' context, imports 'main' from 'djlint', and executes it.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks or data flows that handle untrusted input or produce outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The script flows from executing the module via the command line, importing 'main' from 'djlint', and calling 'main()'. There are no additional data flows or untrusted data handling in the code itself.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies or unusual code constructs. It simply acts as a launcher for an existing module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'annotations' feature from '__future__', which is standard for compatibility. It checks if the script is run as the main module and then imports and runs 'main' from 'djlint'. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a typical entry point script for command-line interface execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wrapper for executing the 'djlint' tool, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle untrusted data internally and does not perform any dangerous operations.",
