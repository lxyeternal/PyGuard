{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point to run the 'djlint' tool via Python's module execution command.",
  "sources": "The code imports '__future__.annotations' and conditionally imports 'main' from 'djlint' when executed as a script.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process or handle any untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: upon execution, it imports and calls 'djlint.main()', which is the main function of the 'djlint' package.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and standard for a command-line script launcher.",
  "analysis": "The script uses a standard pattern to invoke 'djlint' from the command line. The only import beyond built-ins is from 'djlint', which is a known package used for code linting. The code does not process user input, handle data, or execute any dynamic code beyond calling 'main()'. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The purpose is clear and aligned with typical CLI script structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point for the 'djlint' tool, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely forwards execution to the 'djlint' main function. There are no suspicious behaviors or vulnerabilities present.",
