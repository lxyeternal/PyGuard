{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point to run the 'djlint' tool via Python, specifically executing its main function.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module invocation command and the 'main' function from 'djlint'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the script execution command to importing 'main' from 'djlint' and calling it; there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code is minimal and standard for a command-line interface entry point.",
  "analysis": "The script checks if it's run as the main module, then imports 'main' from 'djlint' and executes it. This is a typical pattern for CLI entry points. There is no dynamic code execution, input handling, or other suspicious behavior. The import is straightforward, and no external data is processed directly in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI entry point for the 'djlint' tool, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
