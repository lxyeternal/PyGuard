{
  "purpose": "To run the 'main' function from the 'djlint' package when executed as a script.",
  "sources": "The script imports the 'main' function from 'djlint' when executed directly.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Execution flows from the '__main__' block to 'djlint.main()' with no additional data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports and executes the 'main' function from the 'djlint' package when run as a script. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious code. The import is from a known package, and the code does not contain any obfuscated or unusual language features. The use of '__future__' import is standard for forward compatibility. Overall, the script acts as a command-line interface wrapper without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic entry point for 'djlint' and contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a straightforward script launcher.",
