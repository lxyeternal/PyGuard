{
  "purpose": "The code formats and outputs linting and formatting results to the console, including errors, statistics, and file paths, for a Python linting tool.",
  "sources": "Reads error data, configuration settings, and terminal size; accesses error messages, codes, and file paths.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted messages, error summaries, and statistics via console (click.echo).",
  "flows": "Error data and configuration flow into formatting functions, which produce colorized, formatted console output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries and practices for console output, with no network or external data handling. It processes error and linting data, formats messages with color, and displays statistics. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The logic is straightforward, with safe handling of terminal size and error data. The sys.stdout.reconfigure call is benign and appropriately handled. Overall, the code is a benign utility for displaying linting results.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured console output formatter for a linter, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate benign behavior, and the scores are justified.",
