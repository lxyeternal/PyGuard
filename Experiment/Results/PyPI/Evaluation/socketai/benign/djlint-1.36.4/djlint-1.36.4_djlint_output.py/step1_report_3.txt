  "purpose": "The code generates formatted console output for linting and reformatting results, including statistics and file error details, in the context of a code quality tool.",
  "sources": "Reads input from file error data, configuration settings, and terminal size; processes error messages, file paths, and diff outputs.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to console via 'click.echo'; uses color formatting and text substitution for displaying errors and statistics.",
  "flows": "Reads error data from input sources, processes and sorts errors, formats output strings, and displays via console. No untrusted external data sources are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Uses standard libraries and conventions. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles formatting and printing of linting results, with no evident malicious operations. It does not connect to external domains, execute system commands, or handle sensitive data beyond displaying error info. No insecure data handling or potential for data leakage identified. The code relies on safe library functions and standard practices. It is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured output formatting module for a linting tool. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or sabotage. It operates solely within the bounds of formatting and displaying data.",
