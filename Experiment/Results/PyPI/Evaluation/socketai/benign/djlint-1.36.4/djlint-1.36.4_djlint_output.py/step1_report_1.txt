{
  "purpose": "The code generates formatted console output for a linter tool, including statistics, error reporting, and file path management.",
  "sources": "Reading error data from input parameters and configuration objects; accessing terminal size information; reading file paths and error messages.",
  "sinks": "Console output via 'echo', file path manipulations, and terminal formatting, which do not process untrusted data beyond display.",
  "flows": "Input data (errors, configuration, file paths) flows into formatting functions, which produce console output; no data is sent over network or stored externally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The code strictly formats and displays data; no obfuscated or malicious constructs detected. Uses standard libraries and safe practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs console output formatting for linting results and statistics, including colorized terminal output, relative path calculations, and summary reports. It reads error data and configuration inputs, processes them to produce formatted output, and adjusts display based on terminal size and user settings. No code execution, network activity, or hidden behaviors are present. The code's structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, well-structured linter output formatter with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It relies on standard libraries and typical formatting routines, with no suspicious data handling or external communications.",
