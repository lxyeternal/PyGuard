{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to generate and display console output for a linter tool, including formatting error messages, statistics, and file information.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from error collections (file_errors, errors, errors in build_stats_output), configuration objects (config), and terminal size.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to console via click.echo, including formatted error messages, statistics, and status updates.",
  "flows": "Data flows from error collections and configuration into formatted strings, which are then output to the console. For example, errors and file info are processed into formatted messages and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, network connections, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard libraries and well-defined formatting functions. No hidden or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs formatting and printing of linter results, errors, and statistics. It reads input from error and configuration data structures, processes these to generate user-readable messages, and outputs them to the console. No network activity, file manipulation, or system commands are present. The code uses standard libraries and practices appropriate for CLI output formatting. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful operations. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for presenting linter results, with no suspicious behaviors or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward console output module for a linter tool, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. It only formats and displays information based on provided data, adhering to standard coding practices. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
