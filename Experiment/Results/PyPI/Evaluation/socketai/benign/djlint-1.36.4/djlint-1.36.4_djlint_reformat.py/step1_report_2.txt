{
  "purpose": "The code formats and beautifies HTML files, including optional CSS and JavaScript formatting, and rewrites the files if changes are detected.",
  "sources": "Reading input files from disk (`Path.open()`), reading raw code from file contents.",
  "sinks": "Writing beautified code back to disk (`Path.open()`), diff generation for output comparison.",
  "flows": "Input file read -> code formatting functions -> diff check -> overwrite file if needed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of standard libraries and well-defined formatting functions; no dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script processes HTML files for formatting and indentation, using multiple imported modules dedicated to HTML, CSS, and JS formatting. It reads file contents securely, applies a series of transformations, and rewrites files only if changes are detected. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code structure appears straightforward and uses standard Python I/O operations without obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate formatter for HTML files with no detectable malicious behavior. It performs safe read/write operations and relies on standard, well-structured formatting functions. No malicious intent or security risks are apparent.",
