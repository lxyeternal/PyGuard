  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard HTML formatter with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports correctly assess the code as safe, with malware scores at 0 and obfuscation scores at 0. The slight security risk scores (0.1–0.2) are justified by the file overwrite behavior but do not indicate actual threats. Therefore, the overall security posture is benign."
