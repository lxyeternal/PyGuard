{
  "purpose": "The code is a formatter for HTML files, used to beautify and reformat HTML code, including optional CSS and JS formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from HTML files on the filesystem, specifically the content of the files to be reformatted.",
  "sinks": "The code writes the beautified HTML back to the same files, potentially overwriting original content.",
  "flows": "Input is read from files; the content is processed through multiple formatting functions; the output is written back to the same files if conditions are met.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code performs straightforward file I/O and string manipulation. No obfuscated or suspicious dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple formatting modules, reads HTML content from specified files, applies various formatting functions sequentially, and writes the result back to the files if changes are detected or conditions permit. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The functions used are standard and intended for formatting purposes. The use of difflib for diff comparison is benign. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate HTML formatter with no signs of malicious intent. It reads and rewrites HTML files to improve formatting. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malware are detected.",
