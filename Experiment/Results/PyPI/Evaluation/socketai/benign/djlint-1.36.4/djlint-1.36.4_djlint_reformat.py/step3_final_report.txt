  "purpose": "A Python script to reformat and beautify HTML files, including optional CSS and JavaScript formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a file specified by a Path object; processes the file content through multiple formatting functions.",
  "sinks": "Writes the formatted code back to the same file if changes are detected and not in check mode.",
  "flows": "Reads raw code from file -> compress_html -> expand_html -> clean_whitespace -> indent_html -> condense_html -> optional format_css/format_js -> write back to file if changed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. File overwrite is standard for formatting tools.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O and string processing for HTML formatting, invoking safe, imported formatting modules. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. Diff generation is for reporting purposes only. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The minor risk associated with file overwriting is typical for such utilities and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard HTML formatter with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports correctly assess the code as safe, with malware scores at 0 and obfuscation scores at 0. The slight security risk scores (0.1–0.2) are justified by the file overwrite behavior but do not indicate actual threats. Therefore, the overall security posture is benign.",
