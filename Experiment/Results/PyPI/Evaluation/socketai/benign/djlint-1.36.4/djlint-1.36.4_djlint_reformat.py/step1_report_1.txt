  "purpose": "Reformatting HTML files for beautification and compression.",
  "sources": "Reading file content from disk (`this_file.open`) and configuration settings (`config`).",
  "sinks": "Writing reformatted code back to file (`this_file.open` in write mode).",
  "flows": "Reading raw code from file -> processing through formatter -> writing back to file if conditions meet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation detected. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. Use of standard library and predictable functions.",
  "analysis": "The script reads HTML content from files, processes it through various formatting functions, and writes back if changes are detected. No untrusted input is processed beyond file I/O. There is no network activity, no malicious code, no suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code appears to be a standard formatter with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign HTML formatter, primarily handling file reading/writing and text processing with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. No security issues or malware are detected.",
