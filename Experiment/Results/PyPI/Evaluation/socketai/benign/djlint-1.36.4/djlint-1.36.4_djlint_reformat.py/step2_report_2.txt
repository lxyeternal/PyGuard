  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the described flow, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward HTML formatter that reads files, applies multiple formatting steps, and writes back if changes are detected.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- The code relies on imported modules for formatting, which are presumed benign.\n- The file I/O operations are standard and secure.\n- No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Reformatting HTML files.\n- **Analysis:** Confirms no malicious activity; standard file I/O and formatting.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Formats and beautifies HTML, CSS, JS.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; no malicious activity, standard processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.0.\n- **Assessment:** The slight securityRisk score (0.1) seems to reflect cautiousness rather than actual risk. Given the code's benign nature, this could be lowered to 0.0 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Reformat and beautify HTML with optional CSS/JS.\n- **Analysis:** Similar benign behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Reformat HTML files.\n- **Analysis:** Same benign description.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Beautify and reformat HTML.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.95.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk score; given the code's benign nature, this should also be lowered to 0.0.\n\n---\n\n### **Key points & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Most are 0 or very low, which aligns with the benign analysis. The few with 0.1 or 0.2 could be adjusted to 0.0, reflecting the lack of actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** The reports correctly identify the code as a safe, standard formatter with no malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment & estimated scores:**\n\n**Malware:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Security risk:** 0.0 — no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe HTML formatter with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' scores are mostly accurate, though minor security risk scores could be uniformly lowered to zero for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Your current scores are reasonable but slightly conservative in some cases.**\n- **I recommend setting all security risk scores to 0.0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.**\n- **Malware and obfuscated scores are correctly assigned as 0.**\n\nLet me know if you'd like a detailed revision of each report's scores based on this analysis.",
