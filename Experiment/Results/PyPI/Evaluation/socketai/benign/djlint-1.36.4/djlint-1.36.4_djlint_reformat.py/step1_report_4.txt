{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to reformat HTML files, improving their readability and structure through various formatting steps and optional CSS/JS formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads input from HTML files on disk using Path.open() and file.read().",
  "sinks": "Writes back to the same HTML files using Path.open() with write mode if conditions are met.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> Processes through formatter functions -> Compares and potentially overwrites the original file with beautified code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Uses standard libraries and safe file I/O. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network communication is present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads HTML content from files, processes it through a series of formatting functions (compress, expand, whitespace cleanup, indentation, condensing, optional CSS/JS formatting), then writes back to the same files if changes are detected and conditions are met. The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. It performs legitimate file read/write operations and formatting tasks. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard HTML formatting utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It operates solely on local files and does not perform any network operations or data leaks. Overall, it is safe based on the provided code.",
