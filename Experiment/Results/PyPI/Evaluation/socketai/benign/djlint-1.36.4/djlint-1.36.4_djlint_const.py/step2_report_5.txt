  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Purpose**:\n   - The code defines two constants: `HTML_TAG_NAMES` and `HTML_VOID_ELEMENTS`, as frozensets containing HTML tag names and void elements.\n   - It uses standard Python typing imports, conditional import of `Final` for type hints, and employs `Final` to indicate immutability.\n   - The code is purely static, with no data processing, input/output, or dynamic behavior.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Activity**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, static, and intended as a reference or validation resource.\n   - There are no functions, no external data sources, no network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or signs of malicious intent are present.\n\n3. **Potential Issues or Anomalies**:\n   - The code appears straightforward and well-structured.\n   - The use of `Final` and `frozenset` is appropriate for defining constants.\n   - No anomalies, secrets, or hidden behaviors are detected.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - **Malware score**: All reports assign a 0, which is correct given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n   - **Risk score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n5. **Any discrepancies or unreasonable scores?**\n   - No. The scores are consistent and justified based on the static, harmless nature of the code.\n\n6. **Summary & Final Assessment**:\n   - The code is a static constants module for HTML tags.\n   - No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code is purely a static resource with no malicious or security concerns.",
