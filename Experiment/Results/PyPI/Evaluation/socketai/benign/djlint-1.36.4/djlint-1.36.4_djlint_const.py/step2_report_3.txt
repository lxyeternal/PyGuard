  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Overall Code Content Summary:**\n- The code defines two constants: `HTML_TAG_NAMES` and `HTML_VOID_ELEMENTS`, as frozensets containing HTML tag names and void elements.\n- It uses `Final` from `typing` under a conditional import for type checking.\n- No functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and intended as a reference or validation resource.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code only defines static constants with no processing, input, or output. There are no malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code appears well-structured, with proper use of immutability (`frozenset`) and type hints. No errors are evident.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0` and `obfuscated: 0`, which is correct. The code shows no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n- **Risk Scores:**  \n  All reports assign `securityRisk: 0`, which aligns with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  None of the reports make unwarranted assumptions; they all correctly identify the code as a static constants module.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The code is purely static data definitions for HTML tags and void elements.\n- It employs standard practices for defining constants and type hints.\n- No dynamic behaviors, no data flows, no external interactions, no code injection, or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Given the consistency and correctness of all reports, I concur with their assessments.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n- The code is a benign, static resource module defining HTML tag constants.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at 0 for malware and risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThe current scoring and conclusions are accurate. No changes needed.",
