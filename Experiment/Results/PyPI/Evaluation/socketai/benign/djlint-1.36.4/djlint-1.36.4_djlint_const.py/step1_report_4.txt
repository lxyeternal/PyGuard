  "purpose": "Define sets of HTML tag names and void elements for use in HTML processing or validation.",
  "sources": "Code imports, constant definitions, and type checking block.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data outputs that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, or malicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines two immutable sets of HTML element names using frozensets, with a conditional import for type annotations. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No external data handling, no execution, and no apparent malicious intent. The code appears to be a static resource for HTML validation or filtering, with no malicious or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static set definition for HTML tags and void elements. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
