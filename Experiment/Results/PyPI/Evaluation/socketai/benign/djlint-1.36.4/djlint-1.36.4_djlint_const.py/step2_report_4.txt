  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Purpose**:\n   - The code defines two constants, `HTML_TAG_NAMES` and `HTML_VOID_ELEMENTS`, as frozensets containing HTML tag names and void elements, respectively.\n   - It uses conditional import of `Final` for type hinting.\n   - The code is purely static, with no functions, data processing, or external data sources.\n\n2. **Security Implications**:\n   - The code is static and only defines constants.\n   - No input/output operations, network communication, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hidden logic, or malicious behavior.\n   - The purpose appears to be for validation, filtering, or reference in a larger project.\n\n3. **Review of the Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, static, and serves as a constants module.\n   - They consistently note the absence of data flows, sinks, anomalies, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The analysis is thorough and aligns with the code content.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk score**: 0, since there's no security risk or vulnerability present.\n\n5. **Potential Risks & Assumptions**:\n   - The code itself does not introduce any vulnerabilities.\n   - It is a static resource, likely used in validation or sanitization processes elsewhere.\n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are justified here.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent.\n   - The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis static constants module poses no security threat. It’s a well-structured, straightforward piece of code serving as a reference for HTML tags.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is safe, non-obfuscated, and has no security risks. The reports correctly identify it as benign static data. No changes to scores are necessary.",
