  "purpose": "Define constants for HTML tag names and void elements as immutable sets for use in HTML processing or validation.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines static data structures.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present as there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious code, hidden logic, or unusual behavior. It uses standard type hints and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of constant sets for HTML tags and void elements, with proper use of 'Final' and 'frozenset' to prevent modification. It imports only standard typing modules and employs conditional imports for type checking. There are no functions, no data processing, no external data sources, and no dynamic code execution. No potential security issues or malicious activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign, static code that serves as a data reference for HTML tags. It contains no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is likely part of a larger project that uses these constants for validation or processing.",
