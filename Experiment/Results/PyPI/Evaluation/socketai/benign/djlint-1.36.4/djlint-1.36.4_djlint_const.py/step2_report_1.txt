  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Purpose:**\n   - The code defines two constants: `HTML_TAG_NAMES` and `HTML_VOID_ELEMENTS`, both as `frozenset`s containing HTML tag names and void elements.\n   - It uses `Final` from `typing` to indicate immutability, with conditional import for type checking.\n   - The code is static, with no functions, data processing, or dynamic behavior.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Activity:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a static resource, intended for validation or reference.\n   - No external input, output, or data flow exists.\n   - No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden logic are present.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - Each report correctly states that the code is benign, static, and serves as a constants module.\n   - They emphasize the proper use of `Final` and `frozenset` for immutability.\n   - No report suggests any security risk, vulnerability, or malicious activity.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Risk score:** All assign 0, justified because there are no vulnerabilities, no dynamic behavior, and no external data.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The code itself does not contain any malicious logic.\n   - The only potential concern could be if this code were part of a larger system that improperly uses these constants, but on its own, it is safe.\n   - No evidence suggests any security issues or malicious activity.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a benign, static constants module for HTML validation.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n   - No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, straightforward, and contains no malicious or security-sensitive content.",
