{
  "purpose": "Defines static constants for HTML tag names and void elements as immutable frozensets, serving as reference data for validation or processing.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static constants are defined within the module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external output present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only declares constants without dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static definitions with proper use of immutability and type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two frozensets containing HTML tags and void elements, with conditional import of 'Final' for type hinting. It is static, with no functions, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of 'Final' and 'frozenset' indicates good practices for defining constants. No suspicious patterns, hidden logic, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static resource module defining HTML tag constants. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and is safe for use as a reference. The assigned scores are justified and should remain at zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
