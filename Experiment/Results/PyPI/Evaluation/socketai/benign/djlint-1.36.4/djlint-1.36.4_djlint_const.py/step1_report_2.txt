  "purpose": "Define sets of HTML tag names and void elements as constants for use in HTML processing or validation.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of HTML tags and void elements; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output functions are involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; code only initializes constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors detected. Usage of type checking imports appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations and typing modules, then conditionally imports Final for type checking. It defines two frozensets containing HTML tag names and void elements, respectively. These are static constant collections intended for validation or reference purposes. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or data handling. The code's structure is straightforward, serving as a static resource container with no suspicious or malicious code behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign static resource defining constants for HTML tags and void elements. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are present.",
