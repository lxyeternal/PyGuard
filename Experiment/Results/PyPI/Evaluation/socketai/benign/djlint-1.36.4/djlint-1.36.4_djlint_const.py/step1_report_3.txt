{
  "purpose": "Define constants for HTML tag names and void elements as frozensets for use in HTML processing or validation.",
  "sources": "Constants HTML_TAG_NAMES and HTML_VOID_ELEMENTS are assigned from hardcoded string tuples at module load.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or input, as the code only initializes immutable data structures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type hints, conditionally imports Final for type checking, and defines two frozensets containing HTML tag names and void elements. These are static, hardcoded collections used for reference or validation. There are no input/output operations, network communications, or dynamic code execution. The structure is straightforward and only serves as a constants module without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple definition of HTML tag name constants for validation or processing purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues.",
