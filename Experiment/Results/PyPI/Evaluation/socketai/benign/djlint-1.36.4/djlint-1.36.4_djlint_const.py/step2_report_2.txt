  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines two constants, `HTML_TAG_NAMES` and `HTML_VOID_ELEMENTS`, as `frozenset`s containing HTML tag names and void elements, respectively.\n   - It uses `Final` for type hinting, with conditional import for type checking.\n   - The code is static, with no functions, data processing, or dynamic behavior.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Activity**:\n   - There are no input/output operations, no data processing, no network activity.\n   - The code only defines static constants, serving as a reference for HTML validation or processing.\n   - No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or hidden logic are present.\n   - The use of `Final` and `frozenset` indicates immutability, which is good practice for constants.\n\n3. **Assessment of Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, static, and serves as a reference data module.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no data flows, no external inputs, no outputs, and no suspicious behavior.\n   - The analysis in each report is consistent, emphasizing the static and safe nature of the code.\n\n4. **Scores Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature. Since there's no security risk, this is justified.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns?**\n   - No, the analysis is consistent and reasonable.\n   - The code is a simple constants module with no security concerns.\n\n**Final Evaluation**:\n- The code is a static resource defining HTML tags and void elements.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Overall Estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments. No changes needed.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is benign, static, and safe for use as a reference in HTML validation or processing. The scores reflect this accurately.",
