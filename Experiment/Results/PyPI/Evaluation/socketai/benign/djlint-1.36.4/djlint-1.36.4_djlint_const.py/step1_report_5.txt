  "purpose": "Define constants for HTML tag names and void elements as immutable sets for use in HTML processing.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input/output operations, or untrusted data pathways in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only constant definitions with no dynamic or executable code. Usage of 'Final' hints at intent for immutability. No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations and typing modules, then defines two immutable sets: HTML_TAG_NAMES and HTML_VOID_ELEMENTS. These sets list HTML tags and void elements respectively, for use in HTML validation or sanitization. The use of 'Final' from typing indicates an intention for these sets to remain constant. No functions, data processing, or external interactions are present. No potential malicious behavior, code injection, or data leaks are detectable in this static code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines static constant sets for HTML tags and void elements, serving as configuration or reference data. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
