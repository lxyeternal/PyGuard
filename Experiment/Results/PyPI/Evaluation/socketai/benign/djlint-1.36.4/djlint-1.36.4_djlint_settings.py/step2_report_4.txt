  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described logic with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a configuration and utility setup for djlint, including project root detection, config loading, and regex pattern definitions. It emphasizes the static nature of regex patterns and the absence of malicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code indeed reads configuration files (.gitignore, pyproject.toml, djlint.toml, .djlintrc, .djlint_rules.yaml).\n  - It constructs numerous regex patterns for parsing HTML and templates.\n  - No code execution, network activity, or dynamic code injection is present.\n  - The regex patterns are static strings, not evaluated dynamically.\n  - No obfuscated or malicious code found.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the report.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, as the code is primarily configuration and pattern definitions.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing configuration loading, regex pattern definitions, and project root detection, with no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code loads configuration files (.toml, .yaml, .json), performs directory checks, and defines regex patterns.\n  - Patterns are static; no code execution or dynamic evaluation.\n  - No suspicious or obfuscated code.\n  - Error handling is standard, mainly logging errors.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — matches the report.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, given the nature.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is consistent; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on configuration management, regex pattern building, and project root detection, with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code reads configuration files and constructs regex patterns for parsing.\n  - No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or network activity.\n  - Patterns are static strings for pattern matching.\n  - Error handling is straightforward.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — still very low, justified by the static pattern definitions.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion matches the code. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, highlighting safe configuration loading, regex pattern building, and no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code loads configs, constructs regex patterns, and performs project root detection.\n  - No code injection, dynamic evaluation, or malicious payload.\n  - Patterns are static.\n  - Error handling and logging are standard.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes that the code is a static configuration module with regex patterns for parsing, no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The code primarily reads configuration files and defines static regex patterns.\n  - No dynamic code execution, no network activity.\n  - Patterns are constants, not evaluated dynamically.\n  - No suspicious code constructs or obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — matches the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — appropriate, given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is accurate; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily configuration, pattern definitions, and project setup logic.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The regex patterns are complex but static, serving parsing purposes only.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1–0.2) are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment:**\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated overall security risk score:** **0.1–0.2** (very low, mainly due to complexity, not malicious intent)\n\n**The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured configuration and pattern setup module for a Python-based HTML/templating linter, with no malicious or suspicious elements.**",
