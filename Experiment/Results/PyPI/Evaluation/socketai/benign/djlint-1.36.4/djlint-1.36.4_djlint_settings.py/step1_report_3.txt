{
  "purpose": "Configuration and utility functions for a code formatting/linting tool called djlint, including project root detection, config loading, and regex pattern definitions for HTML/template parsing.",
  "sources": "Filesystem reads for configuration files (.gitignore, pyproject.toml, djlint.toml, .djlintrc, .djlint_rules.yaml), environment variables, and standard input (implied). No untrusted data sources directly processed.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes untrusted data or executes commands based on untrusted input. It builds regex patterns, reads configuration files, and logs errors.",
  "flows": "Configuration file reading flows into data structures but does not execute untrusted code. Regex patterns are static strings built from constants and input parameters but are not executed or evaluated dynamically. Loading functions do not process external untrusted inputs beyond reading static config files.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation. Use of extensive regex patterns appears to be for pattern matching HTML/template syntax. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or code execution features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs project root detection, loads configuration files, and defines complex regex patterns for parsing HTML and templates. These patterns are static and generated from constants, not user input. Error handling involves logging and raising exceptions, with no direct execution of external or untrusted data. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors is present. The extensive regex definitions are for parsing and formatting and do not pose security risks. Overall, the code appears to be a benign configuration and utility module for a formatting tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration utility for a formatting/linting tool with extensive regex pattern definitions for parsing HTML and templates. It performs file system checks and loads configuration files but does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malware or supply chain attacks.",
