{
  "purpose": "The code provides configuration setup, project root detection, and regex pattern definitions for parsing HTML and templates in the djlint linter. It loads various config files and constructs static regex patterns for pattern matching.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files (.gitignore, pyproject.toml, djlint.toml, .djlintrc, .djlint_rules.yaml) and defines static regex patterns used for parsing templates and HTML.",
  "sinks": "No evidence of data leakage, code injection, or external data sinks. Data flows are limited to file reads and pattern matching with static regex strings.",
  "flows": "File reads for configuration and pattern definitions; static regex patterns used for parsing; no dynamic code execution or external network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. Regex patterns are static and used solely for pattern matching.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily configuration and utility functions for a Python HTML/templating linter. It performs project root detection, loads configuration files, and defines complex but static regex patterns for parsing. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. Error handling is standard, and the regex patterns are constants used for pattern matching purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate configuration and pattern setup module with no malicious intent or behavior. It is static, safe, and does not pose any security risks.",
