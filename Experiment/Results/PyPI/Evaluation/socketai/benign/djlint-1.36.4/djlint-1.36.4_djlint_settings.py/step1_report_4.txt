  "purpose": "Configuration and utility functions for a Python code formatting/linting tool called djlint, including rules loading, project root detection, and regex pattern construction.",
  "sources": "File reads for configuration files (.toml, .yaml, .json), directory searches for project root indicators (.git, pyproject.toml, etc.), and user inputs via command line parameters.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; code primarily reads configuration files and sets up regex patterns and internal state. No network or system modification operations are present.",
  "flows": "Configuration files are read and parsed; settings influence regex patterns and internal configuration; no data flows to external systems or insecure code execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "The code extensively uses complex regex pattern construction for parsing HTML and template tags, but these are static pattern definitions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected. Logging of errors occurs, but only for configuration loading failures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration loading, project root detection, and regex pattern building for a formatting tool. It reads files like pyproject.toml, djlint.toml, and .djlintrc; handles exceptions gracefully. No network activity, code injection, or malicious data handling is evident. The regex patterns are static, designed for parsing templates and HTML, with no dynamic evaluation or obfuscation. No suspicious code pathways or malware-like behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a configuration and pattern setup utility for a code formatter/linter. It loads configuration files securely, constructs static regex patterns for parsing HTML and templates, and manages internal state based on user inputs and project files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code segment.",
