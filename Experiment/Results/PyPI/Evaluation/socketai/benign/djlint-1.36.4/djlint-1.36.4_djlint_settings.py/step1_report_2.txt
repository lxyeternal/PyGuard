{
  "purpose": "Configuration and utility functions for a code formatter and linter tool (djlint), including loading configurations, defining regex patterns for HTML and template parsing, and managing project settings.",
  "sources": "File reads for configuration files (.toml, .yaml, .json), environment variables (indirectly through sys.version_info), and inline string patterns defined within the class.",
  "sinks": "None identified that lead to data leaks, code execution, or system modifications. The code mostly reads configurations and defines regex patterns; it does not execute untrusted code or send data over the network.",
  "flows": "Configuration files are loaded and parsed; regex patterns are constructed and stored for later use in parsing and formatting operations; project root detection logic flows from directory checks to configuration loading.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected. Regex patterns are complex but serve pattern matching purposes for HTML/template parsing; no obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. Use of type hints and version checks appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code focuses on project configuration management, pattern building for HTML and template parsing, and setting up class attributes for a linter/formatter tool. It performs file existence checks, reads configuration files (.toml, .yaml, .json), and constructs regex patterns for parsing. No code execution of untrusted data is observed; the only data flows involve safe file reading and pattern definitions. No suspicious code constructs, network activity, or code injection mechanisms are present. Regex patterns are complex but intended for parsing templates and HTML, not malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration and pattern setup module for a linter/formatter tool, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It primarily handles configuration loading and regex pattern definitions. No security risks or malware are detected.",
