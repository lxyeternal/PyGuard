  "conclusion": "The code consists of utility functions for pattern matching in HTML/template files, with no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The primary security concern is potential ReDoS vulnerabilities due to regex processing on untrusted input, which is a known regex issue but not malicious per se. The scores are appropriate, with a slight adjustment to reflect this risk."
