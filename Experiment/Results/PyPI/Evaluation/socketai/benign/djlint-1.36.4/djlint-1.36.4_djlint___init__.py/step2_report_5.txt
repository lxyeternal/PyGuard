  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: potential security issues, malware indicators, obfuscation, and logical flaws.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a CLI tool for linting and reformatting HTML templates, with no suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code uses standard libraries, handles files and stdin safely, and delegates processing to external modules assumed to be safe.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both are set to 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks or malware detected. The logic and flow are standard for such CLI tools.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard CLI behavior, safe file handling, and no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The creation of temporary files for stdin input is common practice. No suspicious network activity or code injection observed.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, justified.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0, code is clear.\n- **Potential Concern:** Slight mention of handling stdin into temp files—this is standard, not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, with appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on stdin handling via temporary files, noting potential but not malicious risks.\n- **Assessment:** The creation of temporary files from stdin input is standard, though it could be exploited if stdin is maliciously crafted. However, this is a common pattern in CLI tools.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, which aligns with the lack of evidence for malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0.\n- **Additional note:** No network activity or code injection detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears safe, with a minor note on stdin handling, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing safe handling of files and stdin, with no malicious indicators.\n- **Assessment:** The use of temporary files for stdin is standard. No suspicious code or network activity.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, justified.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates standard CLI processing, safe handling of stdin and files, no suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- **Risk & Malware Score:** Both 0, fitting the analysis.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe and legitimate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature. No network activity, code injection, or backdoors are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n- **Risk Score:** All are low (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting minimal security concern—mainly the stdin temp file handling, which is typical for CLI tools.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and understandable.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, mainly due to stdin handling, which is standard but could be slightly exploitable if stdin is maliciously crafted.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe CLI utility for linting and formatting HTML templates. No malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are evident based on the provided implementation and analysis.",
