  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Describes a CLI tool for linting/formatting HTML templates, handling files, stdin, progress bars, and concurrency.\n- **Potential Sinks:** Reading files, writing to temp files, printing output.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no external network activity, no hardcoded secrets. Uses standard patterns for CLI tools.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate utility. Malware score: 0. Justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard handling of stdin via temp files.\n- **Potential Sinks:** File I/O, stdout.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns. Standard temp file usage, no network calls.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected. Malware score: 0. Justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Same core functionality, with focus on stdin handling via temp files.\n- **Potential Sinks:** File reading/writing, output.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Minor concern about stdin into temp file, but this is typical for CLI tools. No suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior. Malware score: 0. Justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Same as above, standard CLI processing.\n- **Potential Sinks:** Files, stdout.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no external network, no obfuscated code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate. Malware score: 0. Justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar, stdin handling with temp files.\n- **Potential Sinks:** File I/O, stdout.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity, no external connections.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe. Malware score: 0. Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, accurate; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (around 0.1 to 0.2), justified by the benign nature of the code and handling.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard CLI utility for linting and formatting HTML templates.\n- It handles files and stdin safely, with no evidence of malicious activity.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.\n- Use of temporary files for stdin is common and safe.\n- External modules are used for CLI, progress, and output formatting, all standard.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (due to stdin handling, but very low risk)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, legitimate, and free of malicious intent.",
