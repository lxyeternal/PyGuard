  "purpose": "A CLI tool for linting and reformatting HTML templates, handling files and stdin, with progress indication and concurrency.",
  "sources": "File paths from arguments, stdin stream read into temporary file",
  "sinks": "File I/O (reading/writing temp files), stdout (printing output), external modules for linting and reformatting",
  "flows": "Input sources (files or stdin) -> temporary file (if stdin) -> processing functions (lint_file, reformat_file) -> output to stdout or files",
  "anomalies": "Use of temporary files for stdin input is standard; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical CLI utility for linting and formatting HTML templates. It handles file inputs and stdin safely, using standard libraries and patterns. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The stdin handling via temporary files is common and safe, though it could be exploited if stdin is maliciously crafted, but this is a known risk in CLI tools. External modules are assumed to be safe. No network activity or data exfiltration observed. The code's structure and flow are straightforward, with proper resource cleanup. Overall, the code appears legitimate and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard CLI utility for HTML template linting and formatting. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to stdin handling. The reports are consistent and justified.",
