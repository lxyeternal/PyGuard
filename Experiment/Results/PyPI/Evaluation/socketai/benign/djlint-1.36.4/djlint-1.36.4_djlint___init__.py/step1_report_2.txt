{
  "purpose": "The script is a command-line interface tool for linting and reformatting HTML templates, supporting various options for customization.",
  "sources": "Reads input from files specified in command-line arguments or standard input (stdin). Reads configuration files and environment variables if specified.",
  "sinks": "Processes files with functions like get_src, reformat_file, and lint_file, which may perform file I/O and output. Uses temporary files for stdin input. Outputs results to stdout or terminal.",
  "flows": "Input sources (files or stdin) are processed via get_src; data flows into reformat_file and lint_file functions; results are collected and printed to stdout. Temporary files are created for stdin input, then deleted.",
  "anomalies": "Uses temporary files to handle stdin input, which is standard practice. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials observed. No unusual code constructs or obfuscated code. Progress bar formatting is complex but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard CLI operations for linting and formatting files, with support for various options. It handles stdin input by creating a temporary file, ensuring compatibility with existing functions. File processing is done via concurrent execution, with progress indication. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All external calls are limited to file I/O, standard output, and configuration parsing. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI tool designed for linting and formatting HTML templates. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware indicators are detected. It follows normal patterns for command-line utilities and file handling.",
