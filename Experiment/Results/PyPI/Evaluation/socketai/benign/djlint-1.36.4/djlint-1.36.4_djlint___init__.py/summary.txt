  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard CLI utility for HTML template linting and formatting. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), primarily due to stdin handling. The reports are consistent and justified."
