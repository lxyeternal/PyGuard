The primary security concern is potential ReDoS vulnerabilities due to regex processing on untrusted input, which is a known regex issue but not malicious per se. The scores are appropriate, with a slight adjustment to reflect this risk."

The existing reports correctly assess the code as safe, with malware scores at 0 and obfuscation scores at 0. The slight security risk scores (0.1–0.2) are justified by the file overwrite behavior but do not indicate actual threats. Therefore, the overall security posture is benign."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured HTML linter with a potential supply chain risk due to dynamic module imports. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. The main security concern is external module integrity, which is outside the static code's scope but should be managed via secure sourcing. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a low to moderate risk score (~0.2-0.4) is appropriate."

      "confidence": 0,
      "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the use of eval() on untrusted data, which could lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited. While the code does not exhibit malicious behavior by design, this pattern introduces a high risk of supply chain exploitation. Therefore, the malware score should be set to 0.75, reflecting the potential for malicious activity due to unsafe eval() usage. The obfuscation score remains 0, as the code is clear and readable. The overall security risk score should be around 0.75, considering the eval() vulnerability. Addressing this by replacing eval() with safer parsing methods is recommended to mitigate the risk."
