  "purpose": "Type aliases, data classes, protocols, and constants for a photonics layout and component framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party libraries (kfactory, klayout, numpy), and local modules. No external data input or dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "None identified; static definitions with no external data processing or network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks; purely structural definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with clear type annotations and data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of type aliases, data classes, protocols, and constants defining a framework for photonics components and layouts. It does not include any dynamic code, external data handling, network communication, or obfuscated patterns. The scores assigned in the reports reflect the benign, static nature of the code. The only minor concern is the security risk score of 0.2 in report 5, which appears slightly inflated given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. Overall, the code is safe and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions and data classes for a photonics design library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores in the reports are appropriate; a slight adjustment of the security risk score in report 5 to 0.1 could be considered for more accuracy.",
