  "purpose": "Define data structures, type aliases, and utility classes for a photonics component design framework, including geometry, routing, and component specifications.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, type alias declarations, class definitions, and data structure definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data processing points identified. No network, file, or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present; the code primarily defines types, classes, and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard libraries and well-documented external packages.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly composed of type alias definitions, dataclass definitions, class inheritance, and imports. It does not contain code execution, input handling, or external communication. The classes extend np.ndarray for custom array types, and protocols are used for type checking. All imports are from standard or well-known open-source libraries. There are no obfuscated patterns, hidden code, or suspicious constructs. The structure is consistent with a library module for geometric and component modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard library setup for a photonic component design framework, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily defines data types, classes, and constants for use elsewhere. No malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are identified.",
