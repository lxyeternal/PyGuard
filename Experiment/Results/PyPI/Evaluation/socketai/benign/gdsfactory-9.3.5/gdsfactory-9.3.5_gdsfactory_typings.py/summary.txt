  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions and data classes for a photonics design library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores in the reports are appropriate; a slight adjustment of the security risk score in report 5 to 0.1 could be considered for more accuracy."
