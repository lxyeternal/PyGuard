  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility for GDS layout management, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The potential risks are typical for plugin-based systems relying on external inputs, but these do not constitute malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated code is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is justified given the use of dynamic imports and external dependencies, but overall the code appears safe."
