The only minor security consideration is the use of input() for file overwrite confirmation, which is typical for manual scripts but should be handled carefully in automated environments. Overall, it is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose."

The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment; malware and obfuscation scores should be zero, and the overall security risk is negligible."

The potential risks are typical for plugin-based systems relying on external inputs, but these do not constitute malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated code is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is justified given the use of dynamic imports and external dependencies, but overall the code appears safe."

The scores in the reports are appropriate; a slight adjustment of the security risk score in report 5 to 0.1 could be considered for more accuracy."
