{
  "purpose": "The code defines data models and serialization methods for photonic/electronic cross-sections, focusing on configuration export and domain-specific geometry definitions. It does not perform network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "sources": "Parameters, class attributes, and function outputs used for data modeling and serialization.",
  "sinks": "No external system calls, network access, or file I/O present. Data flows are internal within the code.",
  "flows": "Construction of data objects and serialization of functions for configuration purposes; no external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "Serialization functions output function outputs as strings, which is benign but could be misused if functions are replaced maliciously. No code execution or dynamic code evaluation occurs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a domain-specific library for defining photonic/electronic cross-sections, with data models, serialization, and registration decorators. It does not include network, file, or environment interactions. Serialization of functions only converts their outputs for debugging or configuration export, not executing untrusted code. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured library for device modeling with no malicious intent or security risks. The serialization approach is standard and safe in this context. Scores are appropriate and justified.",
