  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured serialization utility with no malicious behavior or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal security concerns typical for serialization routines handling untrusted data. The overall assessment is that the code is safe for supply chain use, with no indicators of malicious activity."
