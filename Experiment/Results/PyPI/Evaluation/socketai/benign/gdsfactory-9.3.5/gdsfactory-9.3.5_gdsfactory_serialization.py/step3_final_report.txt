{
  "purpose": "Serialization of component settings into YAML or strings, handling complex data types, functions, partials, and custom objects.",
  "sources": "Input objects such as pydantic models, attrs classes, numpy arrays, functions, Path objects, dictionaries, lists, tuples, and callables.",
  "sinks": "JSON strings, dictionaries, lists, hashes, and serialized representations of functions and objects.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through 'clean_value_json' which serializes or transforms data into JSON-compatible formats, including handling of complex types, functions, and custom objects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for error logging; reliance on external libraries (numpy, pydantic, attrs); no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs extensive serialization tasks, converting various Python objects into JSON-serializable formats, including handling of complex numbers, numpy arrays, functions, partials, and custom objects. It includes mechanisms for hashing and generating variable names. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. Error handling via print statements is typical for debugging but not malicious. The code is well-structured and aligns with standard serialization utilities. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured serialization utility with no malicious behavior or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal security concerns typical for serialization routines handling untrusted data. The overall assessment is that the code is safe for supply chain use, with no indicators of malicious activity.",
