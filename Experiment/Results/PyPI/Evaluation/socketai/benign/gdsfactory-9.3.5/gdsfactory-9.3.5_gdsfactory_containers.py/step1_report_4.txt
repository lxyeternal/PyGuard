{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports functions and components related to photonic component design, primarily for use in a larger design framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from various gdsfactory modules, including functions and components; no user input or external data read directly in this file.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly organizes imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed. The code is straightforward in importing and exporting functions and components.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various functions and components from a photonic design library (gdsfactory). It organizes and re-exports these functions in the __all__ list for external use. No network, file, or system commands are executed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. It appears to be a standard module setup for a design framework, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module organizing imports and exports for photonic component design. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It serves as a standard package interface.",
