  "purpose": "A collection of geometric utility functions for manipulating GDSII components, including moving ports, extracting layers, calculating properties, and shape extrusions.",
  "sources": "Component attributes such as ports, layer info, and shape data; input parameters like layer specs and points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions perform in-memory geometric calculations without network or system calls.",
  "flows": "Functions read component data (ports, shapes, layers) and process them through geometric transformations and analyses; no external data flows or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected; standard library usage and domain-specific logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of well-structured geometric utilities for GDSII layout manipulation, including moving components, extracting layers, computing polygon properties, and extruding paths. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data leaks. Functions operate solely on component data and standard libraries, with no network or system calls. The code is domain-specific, straightforward, and adheres to best practices for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of geometric utility functions for GDSII components, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
