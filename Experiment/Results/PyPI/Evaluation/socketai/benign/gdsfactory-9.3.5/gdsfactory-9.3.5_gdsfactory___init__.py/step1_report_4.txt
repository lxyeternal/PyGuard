    "sys.version_info[:2] == (3, 10) — conditionally triggers a warning, but no code execution",
    "import statements — import standard libraries and modules, no untrusted data sources",
    "warnings.warn — emits warning, no action that affects system security",
    "clear_cache function — interacts with kcl object, no untrusted input",
    "exposed variables and functions — static, no execution of untrusted data"

  "flows": [
    "Import statements — load modules and dependencies",
    "Warning issuance — if Python version is 3.10, trigger a deprecation warning",
    "clear_cache — invokes kcl.clear_kcells()",
    "exposed variables and functions — provide access to various modules and classes"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials, tokens, or secrets",
    "No dynamic code execution, eval, or exec",
    "No suspicious string manipulations or obfuscated code",
    "No network connections, system modifications, or data leaks",
    "Only standard module imports and safe functions"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a structured import and export script for the gdsfactory package. It imports standard Python libraries, third-party modules, and internal modules, then exposes these via __all__. The only dynamic behavior is a conditional warning about Python 3.10 support, which is benign. The clear_cache function interacts with an object designed to manage layout data, but it is a controlled, non-malicious operation. No evidence of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data handling is observed. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. It mainly handles imports, warnings, and exposing functions/classes. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
