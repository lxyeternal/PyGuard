  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected",
    "No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation",
    "No external network communication or data exfiltration observed",
    "The deprecation warning is standard but not malicious"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, a Python version check with a warning, and a utility function to clear a cache. All imports are standard and relate to the gdsfactory package or common Python modules. The version warning is a standard deprecation notice for unsupported Python versions. The clear_cache function resets the layout cache, which is a benign utility. No suspicious or malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code does not perform any network communication, data leakage, or system modifications beyond cache clearing. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, non-malicious part of a larger package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization module with imports, version warnings, and a cache clearing utility. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended for package setup and utility, with no suspicious or harmful behavior detected.",
