{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a license header for a Python source file, indicating copyright and licensing information.",
  "sources": "No data sources, inputs, or external data reads are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are identifiable in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only license and copyright comments with no executable code, which is unusual if taken as standalone logic. However, as a header, it is standard and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is solely a comment block with SPDX license identifiers and copyright information. There are no executable instructions, data reads, or data writes. This pattern is common in open-source projects to declare licensing and ownership but does not contain any behavior or logic that could be malicious. Since it lacks any code beyond comments, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a license header comment, standard in open-source projects, and poses no security risk or malicious behavior. It simply declares licensing information without any executable content.",
