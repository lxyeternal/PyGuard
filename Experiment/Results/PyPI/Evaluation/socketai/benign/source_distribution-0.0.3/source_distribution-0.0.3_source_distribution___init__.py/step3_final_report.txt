  "purpose": "The code serves as a licensing and copyright declaration, providing metadata about the open-source project without any executable logic.",
  "sources": "Comments containing SPDX license identifiers and copyright notices",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is purely documentation",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or suspicious patterns; only licensing comments",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments with SPDX identifiers and copyright info, with no executable statements or data flows. All reviews correctly identify it as benign documentation. Scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the content. No anomalies or malicious behavior are detected. The code poses no security threat and is standard for open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as licensing metadata. All assessments are accurate; no further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
