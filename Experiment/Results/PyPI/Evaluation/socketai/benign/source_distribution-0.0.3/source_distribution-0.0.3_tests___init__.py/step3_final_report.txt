  "purpose": "The code provides licensing and attribution metadata via comments, with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "Comments containing SPDX license identifiers and copyright notices.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or untrusted data handling present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks due to absence of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is purely metadata with standard licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments with licensing information, with no executable statements, data handling, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign licensing metadata with no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is justified. No modifications are necessary.",
