  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a Python API wrapper class 'TV' for TMDb, handling various TV show data operations.\n- They consistently mention that the code constructs request URLs and parameters from method inputs, which are then sent via an internal `_request_obj` method.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are detected.\n- The only minor anomalies are the use of `warnings.warn` for deprecated methods, which is benign.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, backdoors, or sabotage, are identified.\n- The code appears to be a standard, well-structured API client with controlled data flows.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does not contain any malicious payloads or suspicious logic.\n- The URL formatting relies on safe string interpolation with parameters supplied by the user, but no unsafe code execution is evident.\n- No external untrusted input is directly read from environment variables or files; parameters are passed explicitly to methods.\n- The session_id is used in request parameters, but it is assumed to be managed securely outside this code.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- Slight concern about passing user-controlled parameters directly into request URLs and payloads, but this is standard for API clients, not malicious.\n- The deprecation warning for the `search` method indicates ongoing maintenance, not malicious intent.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (around 0.1-0.2), as no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a legitimate API wrapper for TMDb, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise.\n- The minor deprecation warnings are benign and related to code maintenance.\n- The data flows are typical for such API clients and do not indicate any malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (consistent with low security risk, no vulnerabilities)\n\n**Note:** Given the thorough review, I see no reason to increase the scores for malware or obfuscation. The code is safe, transparent, and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe API wrapper with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, and I concur with the low-risk assessment.",
