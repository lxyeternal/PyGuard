{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python class 'TV' that interacts with the TMDb API to retrieve TV show data, such as details, credits, images, ratings, and related information.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters (e.g., tv_id, term, page, ratings), environment variables (session_id), and imports modules for URL encoding and warnings.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests via self._request_obj method with parameters potentially including untrusted input; uses URL strings with formatted parameters; uses JSON payloads for POST requests.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., tv_id, term) flow into request URLs and payloads; user inputs or external data can influence request parameters which are sent to the API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated warnings for the 'search' method; no hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible; no suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs API request URLs and parameters from method inputs and calls an internal '_request_obj' method to execute requests. There is careful handling of parameters with optional inclusion, such as language filters. The only potentially risky pattern is the use of string formatting to embed variables into URLs and parameters, which relies on safe inputs. The deprecated warning indicates awareness of code evolution but is not malicious. No malicious behaviors such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or system modification are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API wrapper for TMDb's TV-related endpoints, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It uses typical request patterns and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behaviors. The overall security risk score is low.",
