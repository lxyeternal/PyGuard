  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Backdoors:**  \n   All reports indicate that the code is a standard API wrapper for TMDb, constructing request URLs and parameters from method inputs. No evidence of malicious behaviors such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, code obfuscation, or dynamic code execution is found. The use of warnings.warn for deprecation is benign and related to code maintenance.\n\n2. **Input Handling and Data Flows:**  \n   The code takes parameters like `tv_id`, `term`, `page`, `ratings`, `session_id`, etc., and uses them to construct API requests. All inputs are passed into URL strings or request payloads, which is typical for an API client. There is no indication of unsafe input handling or injection vulnerabilities, assuming inputs are validated elsewhere.\n\n3. **Potential Risks and Anomalies:**  \n   - Use of string formatting for URL construction could pose injection risks if inputs are malicious, but in the context of an API wrapper, this is standard practice, and the inputs are expected to be controlled or sanitized at a higher level.\n   - The deprecated warning for the `search` method is benign and indicates ongoing maintenance, not malicious intent.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a score of 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score:** Very low (around 0.1–0.2), which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**  \n   The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client wrapper with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious behavior.\n\n**My own estimate after review:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal risk, standard API wrapper)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe API wrapper for TMDb's TV endpoints. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. The low risk and malware scores are justified. The deprecation warning is benign and for maintenance purposes only.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- No changes needed to the scores.  \n- Maintain the current low-risk assessment.",
