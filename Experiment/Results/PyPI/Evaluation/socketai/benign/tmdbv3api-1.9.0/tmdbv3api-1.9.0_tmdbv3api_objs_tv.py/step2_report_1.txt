  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the correctness of their assessments, the consistency of their scores, and any potential security concerns.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard API wrapper for TMDb's TV endpoints.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code constructs URLs and request parameters from user-supplied inputs but does so in a controlled manner.\n- The only recurring mention of potential concern is the use of a deprecated warning in the 'search' method, which is benign and related to code maintenance.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads, is found.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues or vulnerabilities are identified in the code snippets.\n- **Malware or malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No signs of injection, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal concern. Given the code's nature as an API wrapper, this seems reasonable.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The warnings.warn for deprecation is standard practice and not malicious.\n- The use of string formatting for URL and parameter construction is typical; as long as inputs are controlled or validated elsewhere, it does not pose a security risk.\n- No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious network activity are evident.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their security evaluation.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, primarily due to the use of user inputs in request parameters, but well within safe bounds)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no signs of supply chain or security issues. The scores reflect this assessment accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Continue monitoring for any future updates or changes, especially if user inputs are not properly sanitized elsewhere in the system. But based on the provided code and reports, the security posture is sound.",
