  "purpose": "API wrapper class for TMDb TV endpoints, providing methods to retrieve TV show data, ratings, recommendations, and related information.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as tv_id, term, page, ratings, session_id, include_image_language, include_video_language, start_date, end_date, and json payloads in rate_tv_show.",
  "sinks": "Request URL construction and parameter passing to _request_obj; no direct data sinks or exfiltration points identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into URL strings and request parameters, which are then sent via _request_obj to the API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Use of warnings.warn for deprecation of the search method; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured API client for TMDb's TV data. It constructs request URLs and parameters from method inputs, which are then sent to the API. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of string formatting for URL and parameter construction is standard practice, assuming inputs are validated externally. The deprecation warning is benign. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or sabotage are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent API wrapper with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk score reflects the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
