{
  "purpose": "This code extends the TMDb API client to fetch review details by review ID.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the parameter 'review_id' in the 'details' method.",
  "sinks": "The 'review_id' is used to construct a URL for API requests, which could lead to injection if not sanitized, but appears to be safely used within string formatting.",
  "flows": "Input 'review_id' flows into the URL string, which is used in '_request_obj' to perform an API request.",
  "anomalies": "The docstring mentions 'Get the primary person details by id,' which is inconsistent with the method name and URL implying review details, indicating a possible copy-paste or documentation error but not malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The class extends a TMDb API client, defining a URL template for fetching review details. The 'details' method takes a review ID and formats it into the URL, then calls '_request_obj' to perform the request. The input 'review_id' is directly inserted into the URL string; however, since it's used within a URL path and not executed as code, this is generally safe, assuming '_request_obj' properly handles the URL and performs safe HTTP requests. No malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The docstring mislabeling is likely an oversight but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward extension of a TMDb API client with a method to fetch review details by ID. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The primary concern is a documentation inconsistency, which is benign.",
