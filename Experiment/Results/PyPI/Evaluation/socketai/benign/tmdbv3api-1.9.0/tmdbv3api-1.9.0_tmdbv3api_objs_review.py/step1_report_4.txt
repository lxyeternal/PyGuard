{
  "purpose": "The code defines a subclass 'Review' that extends 'TMDb' to retrieve review details from an external API using a review ID.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'review_id' parameter in the 'details' method.",
  "sinks": "The 'review_id' is used in a string formatting operation to construct a URL for an API request, which is then passed to '_request_obj'.",
  "flows": "Input 'review_id' flows into the URL template '% review_id', then into '_request_obj' to perform an API request.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses straightforward string formatting with the review ID; no apparent obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures. No dynamic code execution or external data handling is present.",
  "analysis": "The class extends 'TMDb' and adds a method to fetch review details by ID. The URL template is stored in '_urls'. The 'details' method formats the URL with the provided review ID and calls '_request_obj'. There is no input validation or sanitization, but since the review ID is used as a string substitution in a URL, potential injection risks depend on '_request_obj' implementation. No other suspicious behavior is observed, and no malicious code or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward extension of an API client for fetching review details. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this snippet. The primary concern would be input validation at the '_request_obj' level, but that is outside the scope of this code.",
