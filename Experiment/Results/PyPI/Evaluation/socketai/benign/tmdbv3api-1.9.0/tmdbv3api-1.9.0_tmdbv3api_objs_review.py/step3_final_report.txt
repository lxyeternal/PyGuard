  "purpose": "To provide a secure and accurate assessment of the Python code's supply chain security, identifying potential malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "The 'review_id' parameter used in URL formatting within the 'details' method.",
  "sinks": "The '_request_obj' method call which performs the HTTP request using the constructed URL.",
  "flows": "The 'review_id' is inserted into the URL via string formatting, then passed to '_request_obj' for execution.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected. Minor documentation inconsistency noted but not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass 'Review' extending 'TMDb', with a method 'details' that formats a URL with 'review_id' and calls '_request_obj'. There is no input validation or sanitization of 'review_id', which could potentially lead to malformed URLs or injection if '_request_obj' does not handle URL encoding properly. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors. The lack of validation is a common pattern but should be addressed for robustness. Scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: ~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. The primary concern is the potential for URL injection if 'review_id' is maliciously crafted, but this does not constitute malicious code or behavior. Overall, the code is a benign API wrapper with minimal security concerns, and the scores reflect a low-risk assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign API wrapper with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the absence of input validation for 'review_id', which could lead to malformed requests but does not pose a significant security threat. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, indicating a low security risk.",
