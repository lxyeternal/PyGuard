{
  "purpose": "Define a subclass 'Review' to access review details from the TMDb API.",
  "sources": "The 'review_id' parameter in the 'details' method, used to format the URL for the API request.",
  "sinks": "The '_request_obj' method call, which likely performs an HTTP request using the formatted URL.",
  "flows": "Input 'review_id' flows into the URL formatting, then into '_request_obj' which executes the request.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; URL structure appears standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Review' inheriting from 'TMDb'. It contains a method 'details' that takes 'review_id', formats a URL, and calls '_request_obj' to fetch data. There is no user input validation, sanitization, or indication of malicious intent. The URL pattern is simple and conventional. '_request_obj' presumably performs the HTTP request, but without its implementation, no malicious behavior can be inferred. Overall, the code appears straightforward and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API wrapper class with no evident malicious behavior or security issues. It simply formats a URL with an ID and makes a request, which is typical for such classes.",
