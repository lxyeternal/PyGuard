{
  "purpose": "This code defines a subclass Review that extends the TMDb class to retrieve review details from an API endpoint.",
  "sources": "The code reads the review_id parameter in the details method, which is used to construct a URL for an API request.",
  "sinks": "The _request_obj method likely makes an HTTP request to an external API endpoint using the URL constructed with review_id.",
  "flows": "Input review_id -> URL string formatting -> API request via _request_obj",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual code patterns. The URL construction appears standard. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass Review inheriting from TMDb, with a URL template for review details. The details method formats the URL with review_id and makes an API request using _request_obj. There are no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, and no evident malicious behavior. The class functions as a wrapper around an API endpoint. It relies on the parent class for the request implementation, which appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward extension of an API client with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign API wrapper implementation.",
