{
  "purpose": "This code defines a subclass Network that extends TMDb to interact with network-related endpoints in the TMDb API, providing methods to retrieve network details, alternative names, and images.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the network_id parameter passed to each method, which is used to construct API request URLs.",
  "sinks": "The code makes calls to the _request_obj method with constructed URLs; potential sinks are the _request_obj function and the constructed URL strings.",
  "flows": "Input network_id flows into URL formatting within each method, then to _request_obj, which executes the request.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs. The code uses string formatting with %s, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The class Network extends TMDb and provides methods to access network-related data via HTTP requests. It constructs URLs dynamically using provided network_id parameters and then calls _request_obj, presumably a method for executing API requests. No untrusted data handling beyond URL formatting is visible, and no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code appears to be a typical API client extension without signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward extension for API interaction, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply formats URLs based on input parameters and calls a request method. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
