  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines a subclass `Network` extending `TMDb`.\n- It contains methods to fetch network details, alternative names, and images.\n- URL endpoints are formatted with `network_id`.\n- The core request is made via `_request_obj`, whose implementation isn't shown.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated segments.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The use of `network_id` in URL formatting is standard for API wrappers.\n- The `_request_obj` method is a potential sink, but without its implementation, we cannot assess its security.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent in identifying the code as a standard API wrapper.\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent in the provided snippet.\n- The only potential concern is the reliance on `_request_obj`, but that is outside the scope of this code.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which is reasonable given the code's nature. No significant security risks are evident.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign scores above 0.5; all are low (0.1–0.2). This is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment: the code is a typical API wrapper with no malicious intent.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The security of the overall system depends on `_request_obj`. If that method performs untrusted code execution, data leaks, or insecure network requests, that could be a concern. But based solely on this snippet, no issues are evident.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on observable code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Overall recommendation:**  \nThe code appears to be a standard, well-structured API client extension with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues based on the provided snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, with no malicious activity detected.  \n- The low security risk scores are justified.  \n- No changes needed in the reported scores.",
