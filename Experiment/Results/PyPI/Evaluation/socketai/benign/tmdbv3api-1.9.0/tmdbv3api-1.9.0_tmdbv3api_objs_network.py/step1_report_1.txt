{
  "purpose": "Define a subclass Network that extends TMDb to fetch network details, alternative names, and images from TMDb API.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method parameters such as network_id, which are used to format API endpoint URLs.",
  "sinks": "The formatted URLs and _request_obj method are potential sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or API misuse.",
  "flows": "Input network_id flows into URL formatting, then into _request_obj, which performs the API request.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets observed. The URL templates are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class extending TMDb with methods to retrieve network information via API requests. The network_id parameter is used to format URL endpoints, then passed to _request_obj, which likely performs the API call. There are no indications of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code appears straightforward and intended for legitimate API interactions without any suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API wrapper extension for TMDb, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious supply chain threats. It functions solely to retrieve data from the TMDb API using provided network IDs.",
