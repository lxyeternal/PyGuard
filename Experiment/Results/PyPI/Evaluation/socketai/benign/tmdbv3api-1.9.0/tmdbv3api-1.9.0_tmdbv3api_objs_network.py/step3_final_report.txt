  "purpose": "Subclass 'Network' extends TMDb to fetch network details, alternative names, and images via API endpoints.",
  "sources": "The 'network_id' parameter used in URL formatting for API requests.",
  "sinks": "The '_request_obj' method, which performs the API request with the formatted URL.",
  "flows": "The 'network_id' is inserted into URL templates, then passed to '_request_obj' to retrieve data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs; straightforward API wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple subclass extending TMDb, constructing URLs with 'network_id' and calling '_request_obj'. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The '_request_obj' method's implementation is not shown but presumed to perform standard network requests. The 'network_id' is used safely as an integer in URL formatting. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of this API wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API client extension with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal risk score reflects the safe use of API endpoints. No modifications are necessary.",
