{
  "purpose": "This code extends the TMDb API client to provide methods for retrieving network details, alternative names, and images from the TMDb API.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method parameters, specifically network_id integers passed to each method.",
  "sinks": "Uses the network_id to construct URLs for API requests; no untrusted data is directly written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input network_id → URL formatting → _request_obj method call with constructed URL → data returned",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no unusual variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of TMDb with methods to fetch network details, alternative names, and images based on network_id. Each method constructs a URL by inserting network_id into a predefined URL pattern and calls _request_obj to perform the API request. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The code appears straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to expected patterns for an API client extension.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard extension of an API client with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It simply performs API requests based on provided network IDs. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
