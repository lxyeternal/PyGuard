  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward API wrapper extending TMDb.\n- The primary input, `network_id`, is used to format URLs, then passed to `_request_obj`.\n- No suspicious code structures, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are observed.\n- The analysis indicates no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks.\n- The `malware` scores are consistently 0, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are low, reflecting minimal security concerns based on this code snippet alone.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes, the code does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. It is a typical API client extension.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  No, the logic appears sound for its purpose. The only potential concern is the reliance on `_request_obj`, which isn't shown, but that is outside the scope of this snippet.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  The `malware` scores are all 0, which seems reasonable given the code. The `securityRisk` scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Risk scores justification:**  \n  Since the code is a simple API wrapper with no malicious intent, a `risk` score of around 0.1-0.2 is appropriate. The higher the score, the more suspicious or risky the code appears.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  All reports correctly assign `malware` as 0, indicating no malicious activity.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No, all reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge that `_request_obj`'s implementation isn't shown but assume it performs standard network requests.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low risk, standard API wrapper)\n\n**Note:** The code itself does not pose a security threat. The only potential risk depends on `_request_obj`, which is not part of this snippet. If `_request_obj` is secure and trusted, then the overall risk remains very low.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured API wrapper for TMDb, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the code's benign nature, assuming `_request_obj` is implemented securely and without malicious intent.",
