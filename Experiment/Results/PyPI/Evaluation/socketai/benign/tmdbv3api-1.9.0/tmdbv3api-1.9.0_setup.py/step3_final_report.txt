  "purpose": "The script is a setup.py file for packaging and publishing the tmdbv3api Python library, including a custom command for building and uploading the package.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst for long description; uses fixed strings in os.system() calls for building and uploading; reads package metadata.",
  "sinks": "os.system() calls executing build and upload commands; rmtree() deleting build directories.",
  "flows": "Source: reading files and metadata; sink: executing static shell commands via os.system() for build and upload.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code; commands are static and controlled; no external inputs influencing command execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It reads metadata, deletes previous build directories, builds source and wheel distributions, and uploads via twine. All commands are static, with no user input or dynamic execution. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of os.system() with fixed commands is typical but could pose risks if inputs were untrusted; here, commands are controlled. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the context. Overall, the script is benign and aligns with common packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores are accurate; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the low risk score reflects minimal inherent danger due to static command execution.",
