{
  "purpose": "The script facilitates package setup, build, and upload processes for a Python library called 'tmdbv3api'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long description; obtaining system executable path; reading package metadata; reading package dependencies; executing system commands for build and upload.",
  "sinks": "System commands invoked via os.system() for building ('setup.py sdist bdist_wheel') and uploading ('twine upload dist/*') the package.",
  "flows": "Reading files (source), then executing system commands that could invoke external processes (sink) for packaging and uploading.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() to run shell commands without input sanitization. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code present. No suspicious network connections or malicious data handling identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles packaging and distribution tasks, reading package metadata from local files, and executing build/upload commands. The use of os.system() to call 'twine upload' could pose a risk if inputs are compromised, but in this context, it appears to be a static command based on the script's internal logic. No malicious code or malicious intent detected. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup script for packaging and distributing a Python library. It does not contain malicious code or behaviors. The use of os.system() for build and upload commands is typical in such scripts, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
