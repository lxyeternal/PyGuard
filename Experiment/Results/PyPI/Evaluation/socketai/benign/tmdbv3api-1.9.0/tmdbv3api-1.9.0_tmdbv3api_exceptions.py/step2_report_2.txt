  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition inheriting from `Exception`. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic.\n   - The code snippet is benign and standard for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is harmless and serves a standard purpose.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (fully confident)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0 for malware and security risk, and the code is a straightforward exception class, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity or contain vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - No malicious behavior is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n   - No false positives or unwarranted suspicions are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, standard Python class defining a custom exception. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious behavior, and is straightforward in purpose. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n- The overall risk is negligible.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
