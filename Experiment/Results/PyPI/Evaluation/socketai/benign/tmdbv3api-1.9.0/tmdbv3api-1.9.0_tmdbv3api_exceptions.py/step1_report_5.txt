  "flows": "No data flows; code is only a class declaration without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from Python's Exception class. It does not include any executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward, standard Python class declaration for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign custom exception class with no malicious intent or security issues.",
