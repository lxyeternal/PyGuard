  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling TMDb-related errors.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; class only defines an exception.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only defines a class with no instantiation or method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definition with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple subclass of Exception with no additional logic. It serves as a custom exception for the TMDb module. There are no data inputs, outputs, or any code execution beyond class definition. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a custom exception class. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
