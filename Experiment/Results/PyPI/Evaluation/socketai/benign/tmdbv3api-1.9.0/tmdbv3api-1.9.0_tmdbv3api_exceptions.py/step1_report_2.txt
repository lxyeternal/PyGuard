  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class TMDbException for handling specific errors related to TMDb operations.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; code solely defines a class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class definition present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or external calls. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated patterns. The simplicity suggests it is a standard part of a larger codebase for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a custom exception class without any malicious intent or security risks.",
