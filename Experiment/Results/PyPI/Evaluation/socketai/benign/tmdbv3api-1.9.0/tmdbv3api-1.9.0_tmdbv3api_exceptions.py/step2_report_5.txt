  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the code snippet:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```python\nclass TMDbException(Exception):\n    pass\n```\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple class definition inheriting from Exception, with no additional logic.\n- There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or anomalies.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign and straightforward. No issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Review errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that this is a standard custom exception class with no suspicious features.\n- No errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are correct; no corrections needed.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n- Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, these scores are appropriate.\n\n**Suggestion:** No changes necessary; the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- All scores for malware and security risk are 0, indicating no malicious or risky behavior.\n- The code is purely a class declaration with no executable logic or external dependencies.\n\n**Conclusion:** No justification for higher risk scores; current scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Challenge claims based on assumptions**\n\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are made, only observations of the code's simplicity.\n\n**Conclusion:** No challenges needed.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Ensure score consistency**\n\n- All scores are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a minimal, standard custom exception class with no malicious or suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code is benign.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
