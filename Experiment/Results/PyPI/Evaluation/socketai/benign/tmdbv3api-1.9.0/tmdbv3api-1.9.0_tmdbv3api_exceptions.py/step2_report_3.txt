  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple class definition inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic.\n   - The class is a standard custom exception used for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign and straightforward.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The assessments correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (fully confident)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Justification**:\n   - Since the code is merely a class declaration with no executable or external interactions, a `securityRisk` of 0 is justified.\n   - The `malware` score of 0 is appropriate, as there's no evidence of malicious intent or behavior.\n   - The reports correctly reflect that there's no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made without basis.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Evaluation and Personal Estimate**:\n- The code is a minimal, standard custom exception class with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n- The confidence remains at **1** given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n**Final Justification**:\n- The code snippet is benign.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n- The current scoring and assessments are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nAll reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
