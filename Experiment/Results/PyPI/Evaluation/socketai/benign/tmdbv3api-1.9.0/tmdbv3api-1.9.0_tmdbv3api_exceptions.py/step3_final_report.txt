  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for TMDb-related errors.",
  "sources": "Class definition inheriting from Exception; no data input/output or external interactions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external effects.",
  "flows": "None; the class is a simple declaration with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python class inheriting from Exception, serving as a custom error type. No executable logic, data handling, or external interactions are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, and confidence=1. The code does not contain any vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored. No modifications are necessary.",
