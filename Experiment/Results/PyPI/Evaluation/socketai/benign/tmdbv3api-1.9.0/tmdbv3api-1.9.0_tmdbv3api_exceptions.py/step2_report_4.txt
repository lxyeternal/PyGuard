  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code only defines a class `TMDbException` inheriting from `Exception`. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic beyond the class declaration. The code is minimal and standard for custom exceptions.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes, the reports accurately state that the code is benign, with no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as a straightforward class definition with no security risks, obfuscation, or malware.  \n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n4. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, obfuscated = 0, malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.  \n- These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n- Since all reports conclude the code is benign, and there's no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities, risk scores should remain at 0.  \n- The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify a zero risk score.\n\n6. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.  \n- The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain obfuscated/malicious patterns.\n\n7. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n- No claims in the reports are based on unwarranted assumptions; they all correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n8. **Score Consistency**:  \n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall Justification**:  \nThe code is a straightforward, harmless class definition with no suspicious or malicious elements. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \n- The code is benign.  \n- No changes needed to the scores.  \n- The current assessment of malware, obfuscated, and risk scores is appropriate.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0",
