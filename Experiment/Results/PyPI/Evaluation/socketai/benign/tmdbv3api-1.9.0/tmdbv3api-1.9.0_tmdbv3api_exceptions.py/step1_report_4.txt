  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named TMDbException for handling specific errors related to TMDb operations.",
  "sources": "The class definition itself; no external data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or outputs; the class merely defines an exception.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of a single class declaration inheriting from Python's Exception class. It serves as a custom exception for TMDb-related errors. There are no external data inputs, no data leaks, and no malicious behavior observable. The code is minimal and standard for custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and standard.",
