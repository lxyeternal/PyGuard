  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the underlying code, which is a simple class definition:\n\n```python\nclass TMDbException(Exception):\n    pass\n```\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is a straightforward subclass of Python's Exception class, serving as a custom exception for TMDb-related errors.\n- No data input/output, no data flow, no executable logic, no external interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues are present in the code itself.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Review the logic, reasoning, and summaries in each report**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and serves solely as a custom exception class.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious indicators are identified.\n- The analyses are consistent and accurate regarding the simplicity and purpose of the code.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security risk, raising scores above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The code is a standard exception class with no behavior that could pose security concerns.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware score**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the code's harmless nature.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that there are no vulnerabilities, as the code is purely declarative without executable or external components.\n\n**Step 7: Check for consistency in scores**\n\n- All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThe code is a minimal, standard custom exception class with no security implications. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final note:** No changes are necessary; the code and reports are aligned with the expected security assessment.",
