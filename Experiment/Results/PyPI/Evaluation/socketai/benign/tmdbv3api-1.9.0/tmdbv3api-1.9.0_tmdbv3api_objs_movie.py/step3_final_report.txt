{
  "purpose": "The code is a Python API client wrapper for TMDb, designed to facilitate interaction with the TMDb API for movie data retrieval. It does not contain malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to methods (e.g., movie_id, session_id, ratings), class attributes, and configuration data used to construct API request URLs and parameters.",
  "sinks": "Network requests made via _request_obj to external TMDb API endpoints; no evidence of data exfiltration or malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into URL formatting and request parameter construction, which are then used in API requests; no dangerous or malicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, and no backdoors. Usage of warnings.warn for deprecation notices is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a straightforward API wrapper, with methods that construct request URLs and parameters based on input arguments. It uses standard patterns for network communication and does not perform any insecure operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's structure and logic are clear and maintainable, with no suspicious or malicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for TMDb with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score (approximately 0.2) is appropriate, primarily reflecting the potential for misuse if inputs are malicious, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
