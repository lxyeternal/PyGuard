{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python class 'Movie' for interacting with a movie database API, including various methods for retrieving movie details, images, reviews, and managing ratings.",
  "sources": "Inputs include 'movie_id', 'region', 'page', 'term', 'external_id', 'external_source', and optional parameters for filtering results. These are used in method parameters and URL construction.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially influence URL parameters, query strings, or JSON payloads in methods that modify data (e.g., rate_movie, delete_rating). No direct data leaks or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data such as 'movie_id' or user-supplied parameters flow into URL construction and request parameters. These are used in request methods to access API endpoints. No data is processed or stored locally; methods simply call API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'warnings.warn' for deprecated methods indicates maintenance but not malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or secret tokens are present. The code relies on an external '_request_obj' method, which isn't shown, so internal request handling cannot be fully assessed. No obfuscated code or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The class methods are standard API wrapper functions, constructing request URLs and parameters based on input. No user data or credentials are hardcoded or transmitted insecurely. The deprecation warnings are appropriate for legacy methods. External dependencies are imported but not misused. The code appears straightforward and adheres to common API client patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as an API client wrapper for movie data retrieval. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware are present. The use of deprecated methods with warnings is benign. The code does not contain suspicious logic or payloads. Overall, it appears safe and standard.",
