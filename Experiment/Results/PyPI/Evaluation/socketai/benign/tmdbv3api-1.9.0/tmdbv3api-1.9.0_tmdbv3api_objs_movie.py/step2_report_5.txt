  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the class as an API wrapper with parameters from method inputs and class attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API requests via `_request_obj` with parameters like session_id and ratings are standard; no malicious data exfiltration observed.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. Use of warnings for deprecation is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a typical API client with no malicious intent.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but not evident here)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API interactions, safe parameter handling, and absence of malicious patterns.  \n- No signs of data leaks or malicious behavior.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on the same points: standard API wrapper, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code.  \n- Uses of deprecated warnings are benign.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to deprecation warnings)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Continues the pattern: straightforward API wrapper, no suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.  \n- Methods construct URLs and parameters based on inputs, typical for such wrappers.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar findings: standard API access, no malicious payloads, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.  \n- Uses deprecation warnings appropriately.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0, generally around 0.1-0.2, reflecting the potential risk if inputs are malicious, but no actual vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (code is straightforward)\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1** (minimal, primarily due to the nature of API wrapper code, which could be misused if inputs are malicious, but no evidence of that here)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured API client wrapper for TMDb with no malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects the potential for misuse if inputs are malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:** No further action needed; the code is safe based on the provided reports.",
