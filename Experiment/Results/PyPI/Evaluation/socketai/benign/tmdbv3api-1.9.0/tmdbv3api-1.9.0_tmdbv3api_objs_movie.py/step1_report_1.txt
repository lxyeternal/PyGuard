{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Movie class that provides various methods to interact with a movie database API, such as retrieving details, credits, images, and performing searches and ratings.",
  "sources": "Data is read from method parameters (e.g., movie_id, term, external_id, external_source) and class attributes (e.g., _urls). It also reads session_id from the class context and warnings module for deprecation notices.",
  "sinks": "API request methods (_request_obj) potentially send data via HTTP methods (POST, DELETE) and include parameters like session_id and ratings. These could lead to data leaks if session management or request data is compromised, but there are no evident malicious data exfiltration techniques.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (like movie_id, term, ratings, session_id) flow into API request methods which form URLs and parameters. These are then used in network requests via _request_obj. External library warnings are triggered based on method usage.",
  "anomalies": "The code mostly contains standard API wrapper functions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. Usage of warnings for deprecation is typical. No obfuscated code, malicious functions, or suspicious dynamic execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The class methods serve as wrappers for API endpoints, constructing URLs and parameters based on input arguments. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The use of session_id in request parameters appears standard for authenticated API calls. Deprecation warnings indicate legacy method support, which is not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious external calls are present. Overall, the code functions as intended as an API client wrapper without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client wrapper for a movie database, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It responsibly manages API interactions, uses deprecation warnings appropriately, and contains no suspicious or obfuscated code.",
