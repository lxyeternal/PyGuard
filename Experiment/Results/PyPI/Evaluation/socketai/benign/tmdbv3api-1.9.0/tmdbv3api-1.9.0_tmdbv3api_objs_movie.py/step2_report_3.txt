  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential security issues, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a standard API wrapper for TMDb, reading parameters and session data; no issues here.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API requests are made via `_request_obj`. No evidence of malicious data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code functions as a legitimate API client. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, due to potential misuse if inputs are untrusted, but not malicious).\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; the low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; standard API wrapper.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API requests with parameters derived from user inputs; potential for misuse if inputs are malicious, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; the code is a typical API client.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct reasoning; scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—API wrapper methods.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Inputs flow into request parameters; no suspicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate API client; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (even lower, reflecting minimal security concern).\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard API wrapper, with various methods.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Inputs into API requests; no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Usage of warnings.warn for deprecation, which is benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others; API wrapper.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Inputs flow into network requests; no malicious payloads.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code does not perform any malicious actions—no data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2 across reports, reflecting minimal security concern, primarily due to reliance on user inputs and external API interactions.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious intent or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to potential misuse if inputs are malicious, but overall low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are reasonable given the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is a standard, well-structured API wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated components. The security risk is minimal, and the assigned scores reflect this appropriately.",
