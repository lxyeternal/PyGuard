  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a straightforward API wrapper class for TMDb, focusing on retrieving person-related data.\n- They consistently note that user inputs (person_id, term, page, dates) are used to construct API request URLs and parameters.\n- The reports agree that the code performs standard API calls via an internal method `_request_obj`, which is not shown.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated/malicious code are detected.\n- The only potential concern raised is the reliance on `_request_obj` for sanitization, but since this method's implementation is not provided, the risk remains theoretical.\n- The deprecation warning in the `search` method is benign and typical for maintained code.\n\n**Code Behavior and Security Considerations:**\n\n- The code is a typical API client wrapper with methods for different endpoints.\n- Input parameters are interpolated into URL strings and query parameters using string formatting (`\"%s\"`), which in this context is standard and not inherently dangerous.\n- Since the actual request execution is delegated to `_request_obj`, the security depends on its implementation. If `_request_obj` properly sanitizes or encodes inputs, the risk of injection or malicious payloads is minimal.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present in the visible code.\n\n**Assessment of Malware and Obfuscation:**\n\n- Malware score: **0** — no malicious activity, payloads, or suspicious behaviors detected.\n- Obfuscated score: **0** — code is clear, straightforward, and readable.\n- Security risk: Given the above, the overall security risk is low, likely around **0.1-0.2**.\n\n**Scores Given in Reports:**\n\n- Malware scores are consistently **0**.\n- Obfuscated scores are **0**.\n- Security risks are low (0.1–0.2).\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9–1).\n\n**Justification for Risk Scores:**\n\n- Since the code is a standard API wrapper with no signs of malicious intent, the risk score should remain low.\n- The potential vulnerability hinges on `_request_obj`'s implementation, which is not provided. If `_request_obj` properly sanitizes inputs, the risk remains minimal.\n- No assumptions of malicious payloads or malicious code are justified based on the static code provided.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- The code appears safe and free of malware.\n- The low risk scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No changes needed unless `_request_obj` is found to be vulnerable, which is outside the scope of this review.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, primarily due to reliance on external request handling, which appears standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured API client wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The risk is minimal, and the current scores are justified.",
