{
  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper class for accessing person-related data from TMDb API, including details, credits, images, and search functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as person_id, start_date, end_date, page, and search term from method arguments.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent via internal _request_obj calls; potentially untrusted input (e.g., person_id, start_date, end_date, term) could influence URL construction and API request parameters.",
  "flows": "User inputs (person_id, start_date, end_date, term, page) flow into request URL and parameters within _request_obj calls; no external data flows outside these parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses warnings.warn for deprecated method, which is standard; no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code insertion. The code constructs request URLs dynamically with input parameters, but this is typical for API wrappers and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The class methods primarily perform data retrieval from TMDb API endpoints, constructing URLs with user-supplied IDs and query parameters. There are no signs of code injection, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior. Usage of string formatting with parameters (e.g., '%s') in URL construction is safe here because the parameters are used in the context of API request URLs. No external network connections or file manipulations are performed outside the API request functions. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The deprecation warning indicates maintenance but no malicious intent. The code structure is clear and standard for a Python API client wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an API wrapper for TMDb person data retrieval, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. The dynamic URL and parameter handling are standard and not suspicious. Overall, the code appears safe, with no security risks identified.",
