  "purpose": "A Python class wrapping TMDb API endpoints related to persons, providing methods to retrieve details, credits, images, external IDs, translations, and perform searches.",
  "sources": "User inputs such as person_id, term, page, start_date, end_date used to construct URL paths and query parameters",
  "sinks": "The internal method _request_obj which performs HTTP requests; potential for injection or mishandling if not properly sanitized, but not evident in this code",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into URL strings and query parameter strings, then into _request_obj for execution",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads; standard API wrapper structure; no suspicious behavior or anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code constructs API request URLs and parameters from user inputs, delegating request execution to _request_obj. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws visible in this static analysis. The reliance on _request_obj's implementation is a potential concern but outside the scope of this code. The use of string formatting for URL construction is typical and not inherently dangerous. The code is clear, well-structured, and performs expected API interactions without suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign API client wrapper with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, assuming the underlying request method handles input sanitization properly. Overall, it appears safe and appropriate for use.",
