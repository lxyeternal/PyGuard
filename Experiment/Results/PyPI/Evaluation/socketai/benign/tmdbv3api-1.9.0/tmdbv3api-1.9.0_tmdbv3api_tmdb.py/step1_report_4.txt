  "purpose": "This code provides a wrapper for interacting with The Movie Database (TMDb) API, including request handling, session management, and environment configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for API key, language, session ID, proxies, debug, cache, and rate limit settings; reads response headers for rate limit info; reads JSON responses for pagination and error info.",
  "sinks": "Uses requests library to send HTTP requests; processes JSON responses; sets environment variables based on response data; eval() on proxies data.",
  "flows": "Input environment variables -> _request_obj method constructs URL and makes request -> response headers update rate limits -> JSON response data updates environment variables -> potential eval() on proxies data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on environment variable for proxies is risky and can execute arbitrary code if the environment variable is tampered with. No other obvious malicious patterns or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a wrapper around the requests library for API interaction, with configuration stored in environment variables. The eval() call on the proxy string is potentially dangerous if environment variables are manipulated externally, as eval() executes arbitrary code. Otherwise, the code does not contain hardcoded credentials or suspicious network behavior. The functions appear to perform standard API request tasks with rate limiting and error handling. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. Overall, the code functions as intended for API interaction but contains a risky eval() usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API wrapper with a notable security concern due to the use of eval() on environment variables for proxies, which could lead to remote code execution if the environment is compromised. No malicious intent or malware detected beyond this risky pattern. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily because of eval().",
