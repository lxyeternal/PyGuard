  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** The code provides data structures for HTTP headers and caching, with data flowing from constructor inputs into internal storage, then accessed via methods. No external output or network interactions are present.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected. Use of standard patterns and fallback mechanisms are benign.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and part of internal infrastructure for Requests. No malware or security risks are identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (negligible).\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent, reasonable, and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1; focuses on header handling and cache management with thread safety.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious activity or malicious patterns. Use of threading locks is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is legitimate, safe, and has no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Also consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Focuses on header and cache data structures, with input flowing into internal dictionaries, and no external system interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation. Thread safety is standard.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is standard utility code with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing header and cache management.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is legitimate and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar utility data structures, with no external data sinks or malicious patterns.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is standard, safe, and intended for header and cache handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature—it's standard data structures with no malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct given the code's clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the code's benign nature.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — negligible, consistent with the reports.\n\n**In conclusion**, the reports are accurate and justified. The code is a set of standard, well-implemented data structures used in HTTP request handling, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
