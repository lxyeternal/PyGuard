{
  "purpose": "Provides data structures for HTTP headers and caching mechanisms used internally within the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Constructor inputs, internal method calls, attribute access, and class initializations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network operations; internal data manipulations only.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into internal dictionaries and caches, accessed via class methods, with no external output or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes for case-insensitive headers, thread-safe caches, and domain exclusion, using standard Python idioms and synchronization primitives. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present; the use of fallback imports and environment-specific modules is routine. Input validation is handled via _ensure_str_or_bytes, and data is managed internally without external influence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard, benign data structures for HTTP header and cache management, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.1), justified by its utility nature and internal scope.",
