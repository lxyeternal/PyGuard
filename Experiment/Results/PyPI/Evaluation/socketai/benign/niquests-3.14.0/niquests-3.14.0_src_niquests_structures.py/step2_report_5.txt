  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides data structures for HTTP headers and caching, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code. The malware score is 0, confidence is high (0.9), and the overall security risk is minimal (0.1).\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code indeed defines `CaseInsensitiveDict`, cache classes, and related structures. No malicious or suspicious logic is present.\n\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified. The reasoning aligns with the code content.\n\n- **Scores:** The malware score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk is low, consistent with the report.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on data structures for headers and cache, with no signs of malicious activity. Malware score is 0, confidence is 0.9, security risk is 0.2.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code matches the description. No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n\n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues detected.\n\n- **Scores:** The malware score remains appropriate at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report emphasizes thread-safe cache classes and header management, with no malicious behavior. Malware score is 0, confidence is 0.9, security risk is 0.1.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code's thread locks, cache management, and data structures are standard. No suspicious activity.\n\n- **Errors or flaws:** None apparent.\n\n- **Scores:** The malware score is justified as 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the same structures, with no malicious activity. Malware score is 0, confidence is 1, security risk is 0.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code is consistent with the description. No malicious patterns.\n\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n\n- **Scores:** The malware score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar assessment, no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Malware score is 0, confidence is 0.9, security risk is 0.2.\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code matches the description, with standard patterns.\n\n- **Errors or flaws:** None.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware remains 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's content. The code is a set of utility classes for headers and caching, with no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports rate this as 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero but low, reflecting the utility nature of the code. The scores of 0.1 or 0.2 are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — Minimal security risk, typical for utility code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, consistent, and well-justified. The code is standard, safe, and intended for internal data management within the Requests library. No evidence of supply chain compromise, malicious intent, or obfuscation exists.",
