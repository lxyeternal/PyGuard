{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup for building project documentation using Sphinx for the Niquests Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'niquests' module, reads environment variables and filesystem paths, and accesses the 'niquests.__version__' attribute.",
  "sinks": "None detected. The code primarily sets configuration parameters and imports modules.",
  "flows": "Import 'niquests' to access version info, insert system paths for documentation. No data flows that process untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The import of 'niquests' suggests dependency on an external package. No evidence of malicious code execution, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs found.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file, importing modules, setting documentation parameters, and defining output options. It includes the import of 'niquests' to access its version, which is typical. No code execution or data manipulation based on untrusted sources is evident. The code appears to be purely for documentation setup with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are detected. The only dependency is the 'niquests' module, which is expected for version referencing. Overall security risk is very low.",
