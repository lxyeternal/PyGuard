  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation build for the Niquests project.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, os, and niquests module; insertion of path into sys.path; usage of niquests.__version__",
  "sinks": "No clear untrusted data sinks such as network communication, file writes, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "No malicious or suspicious data flows detected; code primarily sets up documentation configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Import of 'niquests' and usage of 'niquests.__version__' could suggest reliance on external package. The code does not perform any data processing or input handling. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscation or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file, with typical import statements, path modifications, and configuration settings for generating project documentation. The import of 'niquests' and referencing its '__version__' attribute is consistent with normal usage to embed version info. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious code segments are present. The script strictly manages documentation build settings and visual presentation options.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration script for project documentation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this file.",
