  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata variables for the 'niquests' Python package, including title, description, URL, version, author, license, and decorative Unicode characters.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments; no input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static metadata with no data flow or dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "ASCII art comments are purely decorative; no suspicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments defining package metadata. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic code, network calls, or data processing. The import of __future__.annotations is harmless and used for type hinting. The ASCII art comments are decorative and do not impact execution. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and security risk to 0. Confidence is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package metadata declaration with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and their scores are appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
