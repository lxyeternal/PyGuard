  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'niquests' Python library.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads; all data are static string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all values are hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "The initial ASCII art comments are unusual but not malicious; no code that performs dynamic execution or secret handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and static variable assignments defining package metadata. No dynamic code, no input/output operations, and no external data sources are present. The ASCII art comments are decorative and do not influence execution. The version and metadata variables are straightforward. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be a benign package setup file or module attribute definitions.",
