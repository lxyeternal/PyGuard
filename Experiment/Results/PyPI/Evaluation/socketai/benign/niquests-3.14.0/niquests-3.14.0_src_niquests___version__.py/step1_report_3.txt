  "anomalies": "Presence of ASCII art comments at the beginning; no unusual or suspicious code patterns or behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of string variable assignments that describe package metadata. There are no input sources, no data flows, no external interactions, and no code execution or dynamic behavior. The metadata variables are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. The ASCII art comment is cosmetic and does not affect code execution or security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and only contains package metadata definitions. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
