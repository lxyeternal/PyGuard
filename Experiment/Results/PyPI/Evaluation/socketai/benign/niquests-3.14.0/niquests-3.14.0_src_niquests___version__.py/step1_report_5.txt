  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the Python package 'niquests'.",
  "sources": "Read-only string assignments for package metadata (__title__, __description__, __url__, __version__, __build__, __author__, __author_email__, __license__, __copyright__, __cake__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static metadata values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments for package metadata variables, including version, author info, and license details. It imports __future__.annotations__, which is harmless and used for future-proofing type hints. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic operations. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard metadata definition for a Python package with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
