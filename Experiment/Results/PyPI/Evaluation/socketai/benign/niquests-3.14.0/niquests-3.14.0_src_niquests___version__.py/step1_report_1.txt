  "purpose": "Define package metadata for the 'niquests' Python package.",
  "sources": "Metadata variable assignments and string literals",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments setting package metadata such as title, description, URL, version, author, license, and copyright. The presence of unicode characters in __cake__ is benign and decorative. There are no inputs, no external data handling, and no execution logic. No obfuscated code, malicious commands, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard metadata declaration for a Python package, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
