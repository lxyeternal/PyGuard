{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling various error conditions in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, and method implementations within the module.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__(*args, **kwargs) calls which pass arguments to base class constructors; attribute assignments.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation (with *args and **kwargs) leading to superclass constructor calls that process error messages and data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Usage of multiple inheritance for exception classes appears standard. No suspicious network activity or hidden behaviors detected. The code follows typical structure for exception handling modules.",
  "analysis": "The module defines a series of custom exception classes for the Requests library, inheriting from built-in and other library exceptions. It uses standard Python practices such as multiple inheritance, attribute initialization, and detailed docstrings. No code performs network operations, data exfiltration, or suspicious activity. The imports are for standard modules and internal components, and the class implementations are straightforward. No anomalies like hardcoded credentials, malicious backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical exception handling module for the Requests library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and adheres to standard practices. The malware score is zero, and the security risk score is low. No malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
