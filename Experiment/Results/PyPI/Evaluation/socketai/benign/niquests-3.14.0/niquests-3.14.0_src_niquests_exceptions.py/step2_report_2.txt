  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the security assessments are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code solely defines exception classes and warnings related to the Requests library.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, network activity, or external interactions are present.\n- The imports are standard, and class inheritance is straightforward.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code appears to be a standard error handling module.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes for error handling; no external data or sinks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate. No malicious activity or anomalies. Confidence 1, malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard exception hierarchy.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct. No suspicious behavior. Confidence 1, malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes with no data flow or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid. No malware or security issues. Confidence 1, malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Exception class definitions with no network or data leaks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Consistent. No malicious intent. Confidence 1, malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with standard inheritance and no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate. No malware or security concerns. Confidence 1, malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely for exception handling.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports agree on this.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any malicious or security-related issues, a score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, non-malicious component of the Requests library.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and serves its purpose as an exception hierarchy. No further action or concern is warranted.",
