  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues**:  \n   - The code is purely a set of exception class definitions for the Requests library.  \n   - No data processing, network activity, or external interactions are present.  \n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:  \n   - The code appears standard and correct for defining exception classes.  \n   - The inheritance, constructor logic, and imports follow conventional patterns.  \n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.  \n   - The high confidence scores (1 or 1.0) are justified given the straightforward, well-structured code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   - No such scores are assigned here; all are zero, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score**:  \n   - The code defines exception classes only; no malicious activity or code injection is present.  \n   - Malware score should remain 0.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made; the code is purely structural.  \n   - The reports correctly identify the absence of malicious patterns.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   - All reports are consistent with each other and with the code content.  \n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0  \n\n**Overall Justification**:  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions for the Requests library. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The high confidence scores are justified, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- The code is safe, non-malicious, and serves a fundamental role in error handling.  \n- No anomalies or security concerns are detected.  \n- The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
