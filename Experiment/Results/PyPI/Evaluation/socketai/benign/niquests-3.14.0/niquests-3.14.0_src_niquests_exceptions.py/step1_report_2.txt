{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of exception classes for handling various errors in the Requests library.",
  "sources": "Import statements (requests.exceptions, __future__, typing, json, urllib3.exceptions), class constructors, attribute assignments, and inheritance structures.",
  "sinks": "None of the classes contain code that processes untrusted input or writes to external systems; they primarily define error types.",
  "flows": "Error instantiation and propagation flow through exception handling mechanisms; no external data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for the Requests library. It includes inheritance from built-in exceptions and other library exceptions, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. The import of CompatJSONDecodeError from json is safe and standard. The code structure is conventional, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns. All classes are documentation-driven and serve to categorize different request errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical exception hierarchy for the Requests library, containing no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely as error categorization and handling, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
