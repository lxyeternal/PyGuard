{
  "purpose": "This module defines various exception classes for the Requests library to handle different HTTP and connection errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, class initializations, and attribute accesses within exception classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks; no untrusted data is directly used to affect system behavior or leak information.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves raising and initializing exception objects; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present. The code follows standard pattern for exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class declarations for exception handling, with no dynamic code execution, network communication, or data handling. It imports dependencies, defines custom exceptions with inheritance, and initializes them appropriately. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. There is no obfuscated or suspicious code pattern, and the structure is typical for a Python exception module.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard exception class definitions module for the Requests library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs no network activity, data leaks, or obfuscated code, and contains no anomalies that suggest sabotage or malware.",
