  "purpose": "This module defines exception classes for the Requests library, mainly for error handling and warnings related to HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "The code imports from the 'json' module and internal modules like '.packages.urllib3.exceptions' and '.models'. No user input or external data sources are read directly.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it defines exception classes and warnings without performing actions like network requests or data processing.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive functions; the code only sets up exception classes and their initializations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code follows standard pattern for defining exceptions and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines exception and warning classes for the Requests library, with no execution logic, data processing, or external interactions. The use of inheritance and initializers is straightforward. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, non-malicious component for error handling in the Requests library. It contains no malware, security risks, or anomalies. The code appears safe and intended solely for defining exception structures.",
