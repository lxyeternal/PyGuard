{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of exception classes and warnings used in the Requests library for error handling and signaling specific conditions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input primarily from the class constructors and inheritance structures; no external data sources or inputs are processed.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to class inheritance and constructor calls within the exception hierarchy; no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns, are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception and warning class definitions for the Requests library. It contains no dynamic code, external interactions, or malicious patterns. The imports are standard, and the class hierarchies follow typical Python conventions. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's purpose is purely structural, serving as a foundation for error handling within the library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard component of the Requests library, with no anomalies or security concerns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
