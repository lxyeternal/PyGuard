  "flows": "Import of wassima, calling generate_ca_bundle() during module load.",
  "anomalies": "Use of generate_ca_bundle() for a default CA bundle; no apparent malicious intent but warrants scrutiny.",
  "analysis": "The code sets default timeouts and connection pool settings for HTTP requests. It imports a third-party library 'wassima' and calls generate_ca_bundle() to set DEFAULT_CA_BUNDLE, which might read environment variables or system files. The constants are straightforward configurations; no dynamic code execution or hardcoded credentials are present. The generate_ca_bundle() call could potentially expose sensitive data if it accesses system or environment info, but without further context, it appears to be a benign configuration step. Overall, the code seems standard and lacks malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily defines configuration constants with a single function call to generate a CA bundle. No malicious behavior or supply chain risks are evident, although the generate_ca_bundle() call should be verified to ensure it does not access sensitive data or perform unintended actions.",
