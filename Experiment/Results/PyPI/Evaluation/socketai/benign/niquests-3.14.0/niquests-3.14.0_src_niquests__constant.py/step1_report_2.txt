  "anomalies": "Use of a third-party library function at module level for default CA bundle, which could potentially generate dynamic or unexpected data during import.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party library 'wassima' and calls its 'generate_ca_bundle()' function during module load to set a default CA bundle string. This behavior could introduce dynamic data at import time, which may vary or be manipulated. Constants for timeouts, retries, and pool settings are straightforward. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. However, calling external library functions at module scope can sometimes be used to conceal malicious behavior or cause side effects. The use of 'generate_ca_bundle()' appears to be intended for flexible security configuration, but without knowing the implementation, it could potentially generate or load malicious or unexpected data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to set configuration parameters with a dynamic CA bundle generated by an external library, which could be benign or malicious depending on the library's implementation. No explicit malicious behavior is evident, but the invocation of external functions at import time warrants cautious review of the 'wassima' library. Overall, low confidence in malicious intent but some concern over external data generation.",
