  "purpose": "Define default configuration constants for HTTP request handling, including timeouts, connection pool settings, retries, and CA bundle generation.",
  "sources": "wassima.generate_ca_bundle() function call",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external output handling detected",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of generate_ca_bundle() during module load may generate a CA bundle dynamically, which could be unexpected but not inherently malicious; no other anomalies observed",
  "analysis": "The code sets configuration constants for HTTP operations, which is typical for a network client setup. The only notable operation is calling wassima.generate_ca_bundle() to assign DEFAULT_CA_BUNDLE, which might generate or retrieve a CA bundle dynamically. This could be unconventional if the CA bundle is expected to be static, but it does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The rest of the code only assigns constants and imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard configuration setup for an HTTP client, with the only potentially unusual part being the dynamic CA bundle generation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or sabotage. Overall, the code is benign.",
