  "sinks": "wassima.generate_ca_bundle() - potentially a source of data if it reads external or sensitive info",
  "flows": "generate_ca_bundle() output flows into DEFAULT_CA_BUNDLE variable",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; usage of a third-party library function appears standard",
  "analysis": "The code sets default parameters for HTTP operations, such as timeouts and retries, and calls a function to generate a CA bundle string. The function wassima.generate_ca_bundle() might access system or network resources to produce the bundle, but without implementation details, it appears intended for standard configuration. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs present. The code is minimal and seems benign, focusing on configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration setup for HTTP request parameters. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The only notable operation is calling a library function to generate a CA bundle, which is common in secure network setups.",
