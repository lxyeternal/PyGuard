{
  "purpose": "Define configuration constants for HTTP request handling, including default timeouts, pool settings, retries, and CA bundle generation.",
  "sources": "Module load time, specifically the call to wassima.generate_ca_bundle() to assign DEFAULT_CA_BUNDLE.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; potential concern is the external function call during module import which could perform network I/O or access sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Module import triggers the call to wassima.generate_ca_bundle(), which sets the DEFAULT_CA_BUNDLE variable.",
  "anomalies": "The invocation of wassima.generate_ca_bundle() at module load is unusual for static configuration but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, setting constants for HTTP request configuration. The only dynamic aspect is calling an external library function during import, which could potentially perform network operations or generate data dynamically. No signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The external function's behavior is unknown but assumed benign unless proven otherwise. The malware score is appropriately zero; the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting cautious concern over dynamic CA bundle generation. The code's clarity and simplicity support a benign assessment. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no significant vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module with a dynamic CA bundle generation call. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The main concern is the external function call at import time, which warrants review of the wassima library but does not currently pose a security threat.",
