{
  "purpose": "This code sets default configuration parameters for HTTP request handling, including timeouts, connection pooling, retries, and CA bundle generation.",
  "sources": "Import statements and module functions, specifically 'wassima.generate_ca_bundle()'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "The only notable flow is from 'wassima.generate_ca_bundle()' to 'DEFAULT_CA_BUNDLE', which involves generating a CA bundle string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'wassima.generate_ca_bundle()' in a module variable could imply dynamic or runtime-generated data; however, it appears to be a standard function call for configuration. No secrets, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines default constants for request timeouts, connection pooling, retries, and CA bundle. The 'wassima.generate_ca_bundle()' call appears to generate a CA bundle for SSL verification purposes. No input from untrusted sources, nor any suspicious or malicious code, is evident. The structure and content are typical for configuration modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It primarily relies on a library function to generate a CA bundle, which is a standard practice.",
