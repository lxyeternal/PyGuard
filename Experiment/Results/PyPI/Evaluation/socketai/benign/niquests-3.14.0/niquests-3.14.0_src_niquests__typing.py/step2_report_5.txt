  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, potential security issues, and the reasoning behind the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is mainly type aliases, imports, and documentation. No untrusted data handling or malicious behavior observed.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies that the code is static and primarily for type annotations. No data flows, code execution, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0 — justified. Confidence at 0.9 seems appropriate given the thoroughness.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature of the code, with no untrusted data or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes that the code is mainly type definitions and imports, with no runtime or data processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0 — reasonable. Confidence at 1.0 is justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—type aliases, imports, no executable logic or data handling.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; the code is purely declarative.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate. Confidence at 1.0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the absence of untrusted data handling or malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The slight mention of \"securityRisk: 0.1\" is probably a conservative default or placeholder, but no actual risk is identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1 — acceptable, given the static nature of the code. Confidence at 0.9 seems reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others—type aliases, imports, no runtime logic.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Risk: 0.1 — justified. Confidence at 0.9 is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code (static type definitions and imports), the risk is minimal or none; scores of 0 or 0.1 are reasonable.\n- **Potential for higher scores:** Only if there were signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or embedded malicious logic, which are absent here.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0** (or at most 0.1 for conservative default)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent with the actual code content. The code is standard, static, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, and there is no indication of supply chain risk from this fragment.",
