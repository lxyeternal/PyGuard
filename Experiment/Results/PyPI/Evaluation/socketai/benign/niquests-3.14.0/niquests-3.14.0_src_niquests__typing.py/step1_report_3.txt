{
  "purpose": "This code defines type aliases, imports, and data structures used in an HTTP client library, focusing on configuration and request parameter definitions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type alias declarations, and constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks for untrusted data or inputs in this code; it primarily sets up type annotations and imports.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code consists of standard type aliasing and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and type alias definitions, with no executable logic or data handling. It imports various modules, including some from vendor packages, and defines several type aliases for HTTP request components. No data manipulation, external data input, or potential injection points are present. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears to be standard for a well-structured HTTP client library setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static configuration and type definition module for an HTTP client library. It contains no executable or suspicious logic and does not exhibit any signs of malware or security risks. Overall, it is safe and does not pose a supply chain security threat.",
