{
  "purpose": "Defines various type aliases and imports for a Python HTTP client library, facilitating structured handling of requests, responses, authentication, and configuration options.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules and internal components; type alias definitions; constants and comments describing supported formats and types.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as data writes, network transmissions, or eval/exec statements are present. The code does not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up type definitions and imports; there are no data flows or processing logic that handle untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are observed. The code consists of standard type alias definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of import statements and type alias definitions, serving as a structured foundation for a larger HTTP client library. There are no signs of data processing, dynamic code execution, or data leakage mechanisms. The comments clarify the intended use of each alias, and no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The lack of any runtime logic or untrusted data handling indicates low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type alias definitions and imports for an HTTP client library. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. Overall, it is safe and not malicious.",
