{
  "purpose": "Type aliases, imports, and configuration setup for an HTTP client library, with no runtime logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements and type alias definitions; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; static definitions only.",
  "flows": "None; the code is purely declarative with no data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of runtime logic, data processing, or suspicious patterns; straightforward static setup.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, type alias definitions, and documentation comments. There are no executable statements, data processing, or network interactions. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code's static nature indicates no malicious intent or security risk. The previously noted low risk scores (0.1) are overestimations; given the static, non-executable nature, the risk should be set to 0. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly at 0, reflecting the benign and clear code structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, static setup for type annotations and configurations in a Python HTTP client library. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and should be assigned malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.",
