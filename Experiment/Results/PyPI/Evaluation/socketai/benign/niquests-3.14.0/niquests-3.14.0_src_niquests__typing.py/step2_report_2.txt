  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report to ensure consistency, correctness, and security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Content:** Focuses on type aliases, imports, and configuration documentation.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data handling, no code execution, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard type definitions, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected. The low malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Content:** Similar to Report 1—type aliases, imports, static setup.\n- **Findings:** No data flow, no code execution, no anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard setup, safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The reasoning aligns with the code's static nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Content:** Same pattern—type aliases, imports, documentation.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data, no suspicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully justified. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Content:** Similar type alias and import setup.\n- **Findings:** No data handling, no runtime logic.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, low security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) possibly due to the mention of external modules or the general nature of network-related code. However, since this code is purely static type definitions and imports, this is an overestimation. The code does not perform any network operations or data processing that could introduce risk.\n\n**Recommendation:** The security risk score should be lowered to 0, consistent with the other reports and the static nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Content:** Type aliases, imports, comments.\n- **Findings:** No data processing, no runtime logic, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Similar to Report 4, the security risk is likely overestimated. The code is purely static.\n\n**Recommendation:** Security risk score should be 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static, primarily type alias definitions and imports.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The only deviation is in Reports 4 and 5, where the security risk score is slightly elevated (0.1). Given the code's static and non-executable nature, this is unwarranted.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Security risk score:** Should be 0 across all reports, as no dynamic or unsafe operations are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's static, well-documented, and standard nature, posing no supply chain or security threat.",
