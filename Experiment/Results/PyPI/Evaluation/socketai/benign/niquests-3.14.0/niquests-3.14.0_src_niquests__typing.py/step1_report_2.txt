{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases, imports, and structure for an HTTP client library, supporting synchronous and asynchronous requests, including various configuration options.",
  "sources": "Type alias declarations, import statements, conditional type checking, and variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly processes untrusted data or executes external commands; primarily type definitions and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is present; no code execution or data handling occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected. All code appears to be standard type definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, type alias definitions, and conditional type checking for static type hints, which are typical for a Python library module. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted data. The structure and content are consistent with standard library or SDK setup code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard setup and type definition module for an HTTP client library, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It only establishes types and imports, with no runtime or untrusted data processing.",
