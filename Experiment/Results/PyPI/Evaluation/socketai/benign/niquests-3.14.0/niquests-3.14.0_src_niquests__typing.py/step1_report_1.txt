{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases, imports, and configurations for HTTP requests, authentication, and related data structures in a Python HTTP client library.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, internal modules, and vendor packages; type alias definitions; docstrings.",
  "sinks": "No significant sinks for untrusted data, no evident data leaks or malicious behavior from code flow.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified; code is primarily type definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type alias definitions, import statements, and documentation comments. It imports standard and third-party modules but does not execute untrusted data or perform operations that could be exploited. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious actions are present. The structure is typical for a type annotation and configuration setup in a Python HTTP library. There are no signs of malicious intent, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of type definitions and import statements used for an HTTP client library, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
