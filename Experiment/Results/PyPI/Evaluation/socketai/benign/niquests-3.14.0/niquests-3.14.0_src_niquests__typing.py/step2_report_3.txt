  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is mainly type aliases, imports, and documentation. No untrusted data processing, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that this is static setup code with no malicious activity. The low malware score and high confidence are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type definitions and imports, with no runtime logic or data handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is purely declarative, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, static type aliases and imports, no executable logic or data processing.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard setup code.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity or security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, primarily type aliases and imports, with no untrusted data handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, low security risk.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment is consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—type aliases, imports, no runtime logic, no data leaks.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe the code as static type alias definitions, import statements, and documentation. No executable logic, no data handling, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's static nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as expected.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, given the absence of runtime logic or untrusted data processing.\n\n### **Final Expert Evaluation:**\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0 (or very close to it)\n\nThe code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type definitions and imports for an HTTP client library, with no malicious or security concern evident. The assessments in the reports are accurate and justified.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis supply chain component is safe. It contains no executable logic, no data processing, and no suspicious patterns. The risk and malware scores should remain at 0, reflecting its benign nature.",
