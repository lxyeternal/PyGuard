  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code implements classes and functions for constructing, preparing, and handling HTTP requests and responses.\n- It supports synchronous and asynchronous operations.\n- It manages headers, cookies, request bodies (including JSON and multipart), and response streaming.\n- It includes error handling for network and decoding errors.\n- It does not execute untrusted code, contain obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n- Hooks are user-definable and could potentially execute arbitrary code if misused, but this is standard for extensible libraries.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code appears to be a standard implementation of an HTTP client library.  \n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident.  \n- The flow of data is typical: request construction, encoding, network transmission, response streaming, decoding, and JSON parsing.  \n- No dynamic code execution based on untrusted data is present.  \n- No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network behaviors are detected.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, emphasizing the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n- They correctly identify that hooks could execute arbitrary code if misused, but this is a known feature, not a vulnerability inherent in the code itself.\n- They correctly note that the code handles data safely and does not evaluate untrusted content as code.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.95 or 1), aligning with the assessment that the code is safe.\n\n### Scores and justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is clear and standard; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Generally low (~0.1 to 0.2). The only potential concern is hooks executing user code, but this is a standard extensibility feature, not a vulnerability.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The only aspect that could be considered slightly risky is the use of hooks, which can execute arbitrary user code. However, this is a known pattern in such libraries and not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of supply chain sabotage, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (to account for potential misuse of hooks, but not a code issue per se)\n\n---\n\n### Final notes:\n- The code is a legitimate, standard HTTP client implementation.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or malicious intent signs are present.\n- The high confidence and low malware/obfuscation scores are justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown per individual report or further analysis.",
