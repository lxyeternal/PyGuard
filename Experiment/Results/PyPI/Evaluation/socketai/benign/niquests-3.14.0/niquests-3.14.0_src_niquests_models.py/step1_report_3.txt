  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for managing HTTP requests and responses within a network library, including request preparation, response handling, streaming, and async support.",
  "sources": "Input sources include URL strings, headers, files, data bodies, JSON objects, cookies, hooks, and authentication details supplied by the user during request creation and preparation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the execution of user-supplied hooks, handling of JSON data, reading from file-like objects, and network communication through raw response objects; especially when dealing with untrusted data for request bodies or headers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (URL, headers, data, files, JSON, cookies, auth) into request and prepared request objects, then through headers and body preparation methods, possibly into network transmission; responses flow from raw network responses into response objects, with content decoding, JSON parsing, and streaming functions acting as data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard and well-structured for an HTTP client library. There are no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors such as network connections to suspicious domains. Hooks are user-defined and can execute arbitrary code, but this is typical for callback mechanisms. The code does not contain obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious logic. No code injection or data leakage mechanisms are evident beyond expected functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically implements request and response handling with support for synchronous and asynchronous operations. It manages user inputs carefully, encoding parameters, handling file uploads, and managing cookies securely. Hook registration allows user-defined callbacks, which could be a vector for malicious code if user inputs are untrusted, but this is standard for extensible libraries. The network I/O is delegated to underlying libraries, with no evidence of malicious network activity embedded in this code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network behaviors are present. The structure and flow are consistent with a legitimate HTTP client library, focusing on correct data handling and extensibility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation of an HTTP request/response handling library, with no evident malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks beyond normal operation. It allows user-defined hooks and handles data securely, with no signs of hidden or malicious code. Therefore, it can be considered safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
