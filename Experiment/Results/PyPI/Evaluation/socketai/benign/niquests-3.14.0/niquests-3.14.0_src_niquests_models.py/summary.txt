  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard HTTP client implementation with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or sabotage. It is safe for supply chain use, with a very low security risk primarily due to user-defined hooks, which are a common extensibility feature. The high confidence and low malware/obfuscation scores are justified."
