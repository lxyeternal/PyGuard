{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to warn users about deprecated usage of a private module and then import all functions or classes from a module named async_session.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own source for the import statement and the warning message.",
  "sinks": "The import statement could load code from an external module (async_session), which might contain malicious code if compromised.",
  "flows": "The warning is issued first; then the import statement loads external code, which could execute upon import.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of 'from .async_session import *' can hide which specific functions/classes are imported, potentially hiding malicious imports. No explicit anomalies are evident beyond this practice.",
  "analysis": "The script issues a DeprecationWarning regarding the use of a private module, indicating that such usage is discouraged and will be removed in the future. The subsequent import statement pulls all public members from the async_session module. This pattern is typical in Python packages but can be risky if the async_session module is malicious or compromised. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior within this snippet. The code relies on external modules, which if malicious, could introduce harmful behaviors upon import, but the code itself does not contain malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily issues a deprecation warning and imports a module. There are no explicit malicious behaviors or indicators of malware within this snippet. However, the import of an external module could pose risks if the external module is compromised. Overall, the code itself appears benign but depends on the integrity of external dependencies.",
