  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the described logic, and potential security implications.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Issues a DeprecationWarning about importing a private module (`niquests._async`).\n- Imports all contents from a local module `async_session` using `from .async_session import *`.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n\n- **Deprecation Warning:** The warning is straightforward and intended for developers to discourage importing private modules.  \n- **Import Statement:** Using `import *` from `async_session` can conceal which symbols are imported, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** No explicit malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**\n\n- **Potential Risks Noted:** The reports correctly identify that importing a potentially malicious module could execute harmful code.  \n- **Use of `import *`:** The reports highlight that this pattern can hide malicious imports, which is valid, but in the absence of evidence that `async_session` is malicious, this remains a general caution.\n\n**No significant logical flaws** are apparent in the reports. They appropriately note that the main risk is external (the content of `async_session`) rather than the code snippet itself.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.\n- **Malware:** All assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security Risk:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which seems reasonable given the potential for malicious code in external modules.\n\n**Suggestion:** The scores seem consistent with the analysis. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate.  \n- The only concern is the import of an external module (`async_session`), which could contain malicious code. However, without evidence, this remains a theoretical risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are justified and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Reflection**\n\n- All reports assign malware score 0, which is justified given no evidence of malicious code.  \n- The code itself does not perform any malicious actions, and the warning is benign.\n\n**No changes needed.**\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n\n- The reports assume that `async_session` could be malicious, which is a valid concern but unconfirmed.  \n- They do not claim malicious behavior outright, only potential risks.\n\n**This cautious approach is appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: low malware, low obfuscation, minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Expert Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (appropriate given external dependency risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- The code appears benign; the main security concern is the external `async_session` module, which could contain malicious code if compromised.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present in this snippet.\n- The warnings and import practices are standard, with the main risk being external dependency integrity.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type        | My Estimated Value | Justification                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                    | No malicious code detected; depends on external module content.                               |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                    | Clear code, no obfuscation present.                                                             |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1–0.2              | Slight risk due to importing external code; standard caution.                                  |\n\n**Final note:** The code is benign but highlights the importance of verifying external dependencies to prevent supply chain risks.",
