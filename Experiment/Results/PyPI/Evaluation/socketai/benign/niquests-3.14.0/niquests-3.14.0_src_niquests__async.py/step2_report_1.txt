  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and any potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  The code matches the description: it issues a deprecation warning and imports all from `async_session`. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  The report correctly notes that `import *` can conceal malicious code if `async_session` is compromised, but in this context, it's standard practice. No significant flaws.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — correct.  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — correct, no malicious code detected.  \n  - *SecurityRisk:* 0.2 — justified, since importing external code can be risky if compromised, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n- **Justification for Scores:**  \n  The risk score is appropriate given that importing external modules can introduce risks if those modules are malicious. Since the code itself is benign, scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Similar to Report 1, with the same observations.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  No. The report emphasizes the standard nature of the import and warning.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — appropriate.  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — appropriate.  \n  - *SecurityRisk:* 0.2 — justified for the same reasons.\n\n- **Justification for Scores:**  \n  The analysis aligns with the code's benign nature but acknowledges potential risks from external dependencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Same as above. No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  No significant flaws. The mention that `from .async_session import *` can hide malicious imports is valid, but no evidence exists here.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — correct.  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — correct.  \n  - *SecurityRisk:* 0.2 — consistent with the potential risk of importing external code.\n\n- **Justification for Scores:**  \n  The reasoning is sound; the code is standard, and the scores reflect the potential but unconfirmed risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Same as above. No malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  No. The warning about deprecated private modules is accurate.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — appropriate.  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — appropriate.  \n  - *SecurityRisk:* 0.1 — slightly lower, which is reasonable given the warning's emphasis on best practices.\n\n- **Justification for Scores:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's benign nature but acknowledge the potential risk from importing internal modules.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues Present?**  \n  Same observations. No malicious code.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws?**  \n  No. The report correctly notes that importing a private module is discouraged but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *Obfuscated:* 0 — correct.  \n  - *Malware:* 0 — correct.  \n  - *SecurityRisk:* 0.2 — appropriate, considering the potential exposure of internal modules.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Scores:** Ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, these reflect the potential risks associated with importing external or internal modules, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code itself appears benign; the main concern is the potential risk from importing external modules that could be malicious if compromised.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no adjustments are necessary.\n- The warnings issued are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 — moderate, due to dependency on external/internal modules, but no actual malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with standard warnings about deprecated practices. The risk scores are appropriate, and there is no evidence of malware or obfuscation.",
