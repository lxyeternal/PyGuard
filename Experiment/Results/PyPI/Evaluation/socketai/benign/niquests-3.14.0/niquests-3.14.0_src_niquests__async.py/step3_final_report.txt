{
  "purpose": "Issue a deprecation warning about importing a private module and import all contents from a local module 'async_session'.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the import statement and the warnings module.",
  "sinks": "The import statement can execute code from 'async_session', potentially leading to code execution if malicious content exists.",
  "flows": "The warning is issued first; upon import, all symbols from 'async_session' are loaded, which could execute malicious code if present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can conceal malicious imports; the deprecation warning is standard but indicates reliance on internal modules.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a deprecation warning about importing a private module and then imports all symbols from 'async_session'. No malicious code or obfuscation is present. The main security concern is the external 'async_session' module, which could contain malicious code that executes upon import. The use of 'import *' hides imported symbols, which can be risky if the module is compromised. The warning about deprecated private modules is standard practice. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate, reflecting low inherent risk but acknowledging potential external dependency risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, issuing a standard deprecation warning and importing from a local module. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The main concern is the trustworthiness of 'async_session'. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
