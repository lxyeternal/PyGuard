{
  "purpose": "This code primarily issues a deprecation warning about importing a private module and imports all contents from a module named async_session.",
  "sources": "The code reads the warning module and the local module async_session.",
  "sinks": "The warning module outputs a warning message; the import statement loads code from async_session, which could potentially execute code if malicious.",
  "flows": "The code triggers a warning upon import, then imports all symbols from async_session, which may execute its initialization code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can conceal malicious code; deprecation warning suggests caution; no explicit malicious behavior or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a deprecation warning about importing a private module, indicating awareness of future removal and discouraging usage. It then imports everything from a local module named async_session. The import statement could execute any code within async_session, so if that module contained malicious code, it would be executed at import time. The warning message itself is benign and serves as a reminder for developers. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior in this snippet. The main security concern relates to importing potentially unsafe or malicious code from async_session, but without inspecting that module, no definitive malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward deprecation warning and imports a local module. No malicious behavior is apparent within this snippet, but caution should be exercised regarding the contents of async_session. Overall, the code appears benign with no evidence of malware or malicious activity.",
