{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that issues a deprecation warning about importing a private submodule and then imports all contents from 'async_session'.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module environment for the warning message and the import statement from '.async_session'.",
  "sinks": "The import statement could introduce external code if 'async_session' contains malicious code, but it is a standard import; the warning is only for the user.",
  "flows": "The warning is issued during module load, and the import statement brings in external code, which may execute if 'async_session' contains malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The warning message emphasizes discouraged practices but does not perform malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script issues a deprecation warning regarding a private module import, advising against its use. It then imports everything from a sibling module 'async_session'. There is no evidence of malicious code; the warning indicates ongoing code evolution. The import could execute arbitrary code if 'async_session' is malicious, but this is standard behavior for Python imports. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code mainly manages deprecation notices and imports a module, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to typical Python module patterns and issues a user warning about future removal and discouraged practices.",
