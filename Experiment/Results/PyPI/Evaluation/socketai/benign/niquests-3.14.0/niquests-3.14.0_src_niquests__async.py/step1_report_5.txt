{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to import modules and issue a deprecation warning regarding the use of a private module.",
  "sources": "The warning is generated by the warnings.warn() function; the import statement imports all contents from a private module (.async_session).",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn() could alert users to deprecated features but does not pose a security risk itself; the import could potentially expose internal module contents.",
  "flows": "The import pulls in code from a private module (.async_session), which may contain additional code that could be executed upon import; the warning is issued as part of module load.",
  "anomalies": "Importing a private module (.async_session) is discouraged and could expose internal implementation details, but this is not inherently malicious. The warning suggests misuse rather than malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a deprecation warning about importing a private module, indicating that this practice is discouraged and will be removed in the future. The import statement brings in all symbols from a private module, which could contain sensitive or internal code. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, malicious code execution, or backdoors. The warning is a standard practice to inform users about deprecated features. Overall, the code appears benign but potentially risky in terms of internal module exposure.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior. It primarily warns against using deprecated internal modules and performs a standard import. No security threats are evident; the main concern is the use of a private module, which is acknowledged in the warning. Overall, it is benign but suggests adherence to best practices.",
