  "purpose": "Provides compatibility and utility functions for handling cookies within the requests library, including cookie extraction, management, and conversion.",
  "sources": "Reading request URLs, headers, and cookie attributes; extracting cookies from responses; creating and modifying cookie objects.",
  "sinks": "Adding headers to requests, setting cookies in the cookie jar, extracting cookies from HTTP responses, converting cookies.",
  "flows": "Request URL and headers -> Cookie extraction and header creation -> Cookie object creation and insertion into jar -> Cookie jar queries and updates.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code converts cookies and handles cookies in standard ways; no suspicious dynamic code, obfuscated logic, or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie handling functions: wrapping request objects, managing cookie policies, converting between different cookie formats, and managing a cookie jar with dictionary-like interfaces. It includes custom classes for cookie policy and a cookie jar subclass for compatibility, with no evident malicious behavior. All methods perform typical cookie operations, such as setting, getting, deleting, and merging cookies. The code's structure is clear and standard, with no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It appropriately uses thread locks if needed and is designed for security best practices. Overall, the implementation aligns with expected secure cookie management practices without suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for cookie management within the requests library. It performs expected functions without any signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
