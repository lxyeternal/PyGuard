  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility and utility functions for managing HTTP cookies in the requests library, including custom cookie policies, cookie extraction, and cookie jar management.",
  "sources": "Reading cookie headers, request URL, request headers, and response headers; interacting with cookiejar and request objects.",
  "sinks": "Methods that set or remove cookies in the CookieJar, cookie header generation, and cookie extraction from responses.",
  "flows": "Input sources include request headers and response headers; data flows into cookiejar via extract_cookies_to_jar, into headers via get_cookie_header, and into cookie jars via set or update methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward utility functions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Usage of custom classes such as MockRequest and MockResponse is intended for compatibility. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. No usage of insecure coding practices observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements cookie management functionalities, including creating, copying, and merging cookies, as well as extracting cookies from responses and constructing cookie headers for requests. The custom cookie policy allows localhost cookies, and the MockRequest/MockResponse classes are for compatibility with cookiejar operations. All operations seem aligned with standard cookie handling procedures. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data leaks detected. No obfuscation, code injection, or security-threatening patterns are present. The code appears to serve as a compatibility layer and utility functions for cookie management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility and compatibility layer for cookie handling in the requests library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its functions are standard and intended for cookie management tasks, with no indicators of sabotage, malware, or privacy violations.",
