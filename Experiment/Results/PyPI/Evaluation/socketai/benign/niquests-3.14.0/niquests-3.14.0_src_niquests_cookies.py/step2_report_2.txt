  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the reported issues, their reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes standard cookie management functions, custom localhost policy, extraction, and cookie jar manipulation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious network activity. Uses standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (very low).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is standard, and the low risk score aligns with the absence of malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, standard cookie handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Thread safety measures are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, utility-focused code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard cookie extraction, header creation, merging.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate cookie management utilities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Well justified. No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Standard cookie handling, merging, extracting.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Utility code, safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar utility functions, compatibility layer.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, utility-focused.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, matching the clear, standard code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in all reports, reflecting minimal security concern due to the code's utility nature, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code and reasoning.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The code is a standard, well-structured utility module for cookie management with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.05 — very low, given the code's purpose and no detected vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the scores provided in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
