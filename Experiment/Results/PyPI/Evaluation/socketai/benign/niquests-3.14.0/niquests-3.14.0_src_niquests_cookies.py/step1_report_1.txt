  "purpose": "Provides compatibility and utility functions for managing cookies within the requests library, including custom cookie policies, cookie extraction, and cookie jar manipulation.",
  "sources": "Reads cookie data from response headers ('Set-Cookie'), request headers ('Host', 'Cookie'), and input parameters like cookie dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Uses cookie extraction into CookieJar, generating 'Cookie' headers for requests, modifying cookies in the jar, and removing cookies by name.",
  "flows": "Extracts cookies from response headers into CookieJar; generates Cookie header for requests; sets, updates, or removes cookies in CookieJar based on provided data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. No unusual obfuscation or obfuscated code present. Uses standard cookie handling patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cookie management functions compatible with the requests library, including custom policies for localhost, cookie extraction from responses, and cookie jar modifications. It manipulates cookies via well-understood patterns and does not perform any network operations or data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic is present. The use of threading lock for thread safety appears appropriate. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate utility code for cookie handling without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of utility functions and classes for managing cookies in requests sessions. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code appears to be well-structured and consistent with standard cookie management practices.",
