  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility code for cookie management, custom localhost policy, extraction, and cookie jar manipulation.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is straightforward, implementing standard cookie handling with a custom policy for localhost. No malicious logic or suspicious behavior detected. The low security risk score seems appropriate, given the utility nature.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- Scores are reasonable.  \n- No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard cookie utilities, compatibility, extraction, and management.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, a standard, well-structured utility code. The confidence is high, and no malicious indicators are present.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- Scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Cookie extraction, management, and conversion utilities.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is a typical cookie utility module, with no signs of malicious intent. The security risk score of 0.1 is conservative but acceptable, considering it handles cookies which could be misused if combined with other vulnerabilities, but on its own, it’s benign.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard cookie management, creation, merging, and extraction.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe functions are standard, with proper handling and no suspicious code. The security risk score is conservative, which is suitable.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for cookie handling, including extraction and header creation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Security Risk: 0.1, Obfuscated: 0, Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, a standard utility module. No suspicious activity detected.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, matching the clear, readable code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in all reports, reflecting the potential for cookie misuse if combined with other vulnerabilities, but no direct issues here.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- The code is a standard, utility-focused implementation for cookie management in the requests library.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### My Own Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (a conservative baseline for cookie handling modules, acknowledging that cookies can be misused if exploited elsewhere)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign, utility nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
