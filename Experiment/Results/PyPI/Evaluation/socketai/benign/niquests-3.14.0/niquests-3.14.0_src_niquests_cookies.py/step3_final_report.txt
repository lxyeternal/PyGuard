  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for cookie management, including custom policies, extraction, header creation, and cookie jar manipulation within the requests library.",
  "sources": "Reading request URL, headers, and response headers; accessing and modifying cookie objects.",
  "sinks": "Cookie extraction into jar, header generation for requests, cookie removal, and cookie merging.",
  "flows": "Request URL and headers → Cookie extraction and management functions → Cookie jar updates and header generation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard cookie handling utilities, including a custom localhost cookie policy, mock request/response wrappers, extraction functions, and a dict-like cookie jar class. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The functions follow typical patterns for cookie management, with thread safety considerations. The security risk is minimal, primarily because the code does not perform network operations or handle secrets. The malware score is zero, and the obfuscation score is zero, reflecting the code's clarity and benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility module for cookie management in the requests library. It contains no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 are appropriate and justified.",
