  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured test suite for StatsD clients, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scoring of malware and obfuscation as zero is appropriate. The overall security risk is negligible, approximately 0.05, given the controlled testing environment."
