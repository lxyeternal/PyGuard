  "purpose": "Configuration settings for network communication, likely for a UDP socket or similar service.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow detected in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious activity; variables are set with standard configuration values.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static configuration parameters such as host, port, IPv6 usage flag, prefix, and maximum UDP packet size. All values are hardcoded, with no user input, environment variable access, or dynamic code execution observed. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or secret data handling are present. The configuration appears typical for a network service setup and contains no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward configuration for network settings with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
