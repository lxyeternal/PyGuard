  "purpose": "Static network configuration parameters for a service or application.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded variable assignments defining HOST, PORT, IPV6, PREFIX, MAXUDPSIZE.",
  "sinks": "No data input or output, no untrusted data handling, no network operations.",
  "flows": "None; variables are static and do not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for network configuration. There are no functions, data flows, network operations, or dynamic behaviors. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1 are consistent and appropriate given the simplicity and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration snippet with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports and scores are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
