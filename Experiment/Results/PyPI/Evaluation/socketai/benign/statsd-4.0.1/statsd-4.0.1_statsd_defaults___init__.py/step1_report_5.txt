  "purpose": "Define configuration parameters for a network service or client, such as host, port, IP version, prefix, and maximum UDP packet size.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments; no input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or effects detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static variable assignments setting network-related configuration parameters. There are no input sources, no data processing, no network connections, or dynamic code execution. The variables appear to be standard configuration options without any malicious intent or obfuscation. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply assigns fixed values to network configuration variables.",
