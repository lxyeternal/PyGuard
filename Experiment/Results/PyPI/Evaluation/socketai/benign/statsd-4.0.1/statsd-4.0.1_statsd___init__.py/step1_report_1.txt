  "purpose": "This code imports specific classes from a local module 'client' and defines version information and exports for a package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module '.client' and the assignment of version variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; imports and version assignments are static.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from a local module, sets a version tuple, creates a version string, and specifies exported symbols. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. All elements are standard for a Python package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module initializer with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It solely handles package exports and version info.",
