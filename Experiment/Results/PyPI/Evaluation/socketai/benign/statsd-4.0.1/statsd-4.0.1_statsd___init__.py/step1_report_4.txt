{
  "purpose": "This code is part of a Python package that imports classes related to statistics clients and defines package version information.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local 'client' module: StatsClient, TCPStatsClient, UnixSocketStatsClient; Reads no external input data.",
  "sinks": "Defines version information string, but no untrusted data sinks are present or used.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely imports classes and sets version info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. The version string is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a local module, sets a version tuple, converts it to a string, and defines an export list. It contains no user input handling, no network calls, and no suspicious logic. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or version management file.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization file that manages versioning and exports. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues are evident.",
