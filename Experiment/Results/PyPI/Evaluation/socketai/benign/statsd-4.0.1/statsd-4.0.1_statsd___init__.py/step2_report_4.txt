  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code snippets are all straightforward import and export statements, typical for a Python package's `__init__.py` or version module.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, no external inputs, no network calls, and no data processing.\n- All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as expected, given the clarity of the code.\n- The security risk score is 0, since there are no vulnerabilities or suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- The purpose, sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, analysis, and conclusion are all consistent and accurate.\n- The confidence score is 1, indicating high certainty in the assessment.\n- The scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all appropriate and justified.\n\n**Potential improvements or considerations:**\n\n- No issues found in the code or reasoning.\n- The reports are thorough and correctly interpret the code's intent and safety.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the existing scores. The code is benign, standard boilerplate for a Python package, and the reports are accurate.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is safe and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scoring aligns well with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
