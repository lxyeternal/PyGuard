{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer, importing specific client classes, defining version information, and setting export symbols.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports modules and defines constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process or output external data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static and only sets up module metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from a local module, defines a version tuple and string, and specifies exported symbols. It contains no dynamic behavior, network activity, or data processing. The code appears to be a standard package __init__.py or version module, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate benign, boilerplate code with high confidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup file with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly assess its safety, and the scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
