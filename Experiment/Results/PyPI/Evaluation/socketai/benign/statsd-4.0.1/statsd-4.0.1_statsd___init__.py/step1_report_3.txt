{
  "purpose": "Define and expose specific classes from the client module, set version information, and specify exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local client module, assignment of version tuple, string joining for version, and list definition for exports.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations. No external input handling or data output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only imports classes and defines variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no suspicious or unusual constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from a local module, sets a version tuple, converts it to a string, and defines an export list. All operations are standard Python module setup routines. No external inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module setup with class imports and version declaration, showing no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard boilerplate code for a Python package module.",
