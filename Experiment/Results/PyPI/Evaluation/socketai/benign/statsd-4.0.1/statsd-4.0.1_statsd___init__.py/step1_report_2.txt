  "purpose": "The code exports specific classes from a client module, likely for a metrics or stats collection library, establishing version info and module exports.",
  "sources": "Imports classes from a local module named .client, defines version tuple, and exports symbols.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the code only defines constants and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing classes and defining version information. There are no input handling, data manipulation, or network operations present. It appears to be a standard module setup file with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module initialization file with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
