  "purpose": "Import network client classes for network statistics monitoring from internal modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .stream and .udp",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or network communication present in this snippet",
  "flows": "None; only static import statements, no data flow or execution beyond imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes related to network statistics clients from internal modules. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or handle untrusted input. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores (mostly 0 or 0.1). The confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity and clarity of the code. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security issues. The scores are consistent with the benign content, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of import statements for network monitoring classes, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores and assessments across reports are justified and appropriate.",
