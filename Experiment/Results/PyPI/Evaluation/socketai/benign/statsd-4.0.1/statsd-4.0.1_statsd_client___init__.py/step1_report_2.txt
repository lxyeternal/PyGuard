{
  "purpose": "The code imports network-related classes from local modules for collecting or sending network statistics.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules: .stream (TCPStatsClient, UnixSocketStatsClient) and .udp (StatsClient). These are likely used to initialize or instantiate network clients.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code only imports classes. Potential sinks could occur if imported classes are instantiated and used with untrusted data elsewhere, but no such actions are shown here.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing network client classes that may later be used to send or receive data, but no explicit data flow or processing is present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are evident in this minimal import statement.",
  "analysis": "This code solely performs import statements for network client classes from local modules, which suggests setup for network statistics collection or reporting. There is no evidence of malicious code, data leakage, or security issues in these imports. The absence of further logic makes it impossible to determine malicious intent or security risks from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, consisting only of import statements for network-related classes. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are apparent at this stage.",
