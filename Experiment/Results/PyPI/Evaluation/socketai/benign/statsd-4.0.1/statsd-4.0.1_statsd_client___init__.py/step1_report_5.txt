  "purpose": "Importing network-related client classes from local modules for statistics collection over TCP, Unix sockets, and UDP.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local modules (.stream and .udp) to import classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this code only imports classes.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for network statistics client classes from local modules. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or sensitive operations. The use of 'from .stream' and 'from .udp' indicates relative imports, which are typical for package internal modules. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or security issues are present. The comments '# noqa' suggest suppression of linter warnings, which is common for such import statements.\n\nOverall, this code appears to be a straightforward module import without any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement for local network client classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security concerns.",
