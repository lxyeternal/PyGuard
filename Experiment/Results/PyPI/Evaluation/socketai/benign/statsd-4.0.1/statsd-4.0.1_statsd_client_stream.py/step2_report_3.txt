  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scoring and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The report states no obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code structures are present. The code appears straightforward and standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware score = 0, Security risk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9. These seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification for Scores:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are identified. The low security risk score reflects minimal concerns.\n- **Overall:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** Similar to Report 1, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns. The socket connection methods are standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9. These are appropriate.\n- **Potential Concerns:** The only minor concern could be untrusted data sent over sockets, but given the code, this is typical and not malicious.\n- **Overall:** The assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** Again, the code is standard socket client implementation with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1. These are consistent.\n- **Additional notes:** No suspicious patterns or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The report correctly identifies standard socket communication with no obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.2, confidence = 0.9. These are reasonable.\n- **Note:** The report emphasizes the benign nature, which matches the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** The report states no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1. These are appropriate.\n- **Overall:** The code is a typical socket client with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Code review confirms:** No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious patterns.\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with benign code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting minimal concern about untrusted data transmission, which is typical for such clients.\n- **Confidence levels:** High (mostly 0.9 or 1), justified given the straightforward implementation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** Should remain at **0** — no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** Given the code's purpose and implementation, a **risk score of around 0.1** seems appropriate, primarily reflecting minimal exposure due to untrusted data transmission over sockets, which is typical for such clients.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                               |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | **0**           | No malicious activity or code behavior detected.            |\n| Obfuscated     | **0**           | Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.            |\n| Security Risk  | **0.1**         | Minimal risk due to data transmission over sockets, standard practice. |\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's analysis.",
