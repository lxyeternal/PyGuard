  "purpose": "Implementations of TCP and Unix socket clients for sending stats data, with pipeline support.",
  "sources": "User-configurable host, port, socket_path, and optional prefix; socket connection methods.",
  "sinks": "Data sent over socket connections via _do_send method, with data coming from higher-level calls.",
  "flows": "Data originates from higher-level calls to _send or pipeline, passes through _do_send, and is transmitted over socket.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; no malicious payloads or backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines socket-based clients for stats data transmission, supporting both TCP and Unix sockets. It manages socket connections securely with proper connect and close methods, and sends data encoded in ASCII with newline termination. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious data handling, and no external data leaks are present. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are detected. All socket addresses are user-supplied, with no embedded or hidden malicious instructions. The code appears to be standard network client implementation with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard socket client classes for transmitting data. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. The overall security risk appears negligible.",
