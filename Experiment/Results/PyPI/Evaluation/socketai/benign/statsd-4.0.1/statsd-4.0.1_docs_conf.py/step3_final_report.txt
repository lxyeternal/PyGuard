{
  "purpose": "This code is a static configuration file for the Sphinx documentation generator, setting various project and output parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration variables; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static configuration script for Sphinx documentation. It imports only standard modules ('sys', 'os') and sets configuration variables without any dynamic execution, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent, secrets, or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The confidence level is high, as the code is clearly a standard setup script with no indicators of compromise or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static Sphinx configuration file with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
