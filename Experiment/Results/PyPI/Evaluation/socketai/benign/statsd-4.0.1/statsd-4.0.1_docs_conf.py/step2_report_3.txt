  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a static configuration file for Sphinx documentation.\n- The code imports only standard modules (`sys`, `os`) and sets configuration variables.\n- No dynamic code execution, input handling, external network activity, or obfuscated code is present.\n- No secrets, credentials, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be a typical, benign setup script.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified by the lack of any security concerns or malicious behavior.\n\n**Critical review:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the benign nature of the code.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; the analysis correctly dismisses any such concerns.\n- The scores are reasonable and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, safe configuration file for Sphinx documentation.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n- Given the absence of any suspicious activity, the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n**Final estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and confirms that the code poses no security threat.",
