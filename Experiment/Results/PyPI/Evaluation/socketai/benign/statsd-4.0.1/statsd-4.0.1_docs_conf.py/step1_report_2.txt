  "purpose": "Configuration script for generating project documentation using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Import statements (import sys, os); configuration variables for Sphinx settings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data influences system behavior; mainly static configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code appears to be standard Sphinx configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script imports only standard modules (sys, os) and sets up documentation build parameters. It defines configuration options for extensions, themes, output formats, and project metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, input handling, or external network interactions. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, command execution, or obfuscated code are present. The code is a typical static configuration file for Sphinx, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file with no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. It is safe to use in its intended purpose.",
