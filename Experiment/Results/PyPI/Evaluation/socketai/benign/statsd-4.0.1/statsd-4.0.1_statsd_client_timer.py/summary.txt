  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign performance monitoring utility with support for async and sync functions. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The external data reporting via client.timing() is typical for metrics collection and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, contingent on the trustworthiness of the client object. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are appropriate."
