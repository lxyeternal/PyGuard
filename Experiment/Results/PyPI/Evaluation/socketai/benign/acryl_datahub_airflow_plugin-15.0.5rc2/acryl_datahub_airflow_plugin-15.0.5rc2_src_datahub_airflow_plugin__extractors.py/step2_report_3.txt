  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, code behavior, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code extends SQL extractors in Airflow for DataHub lineage, patches methods for custom SQL parsing, and manages multiple operator types. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The code reads SQL queries and operator attributes, processes lineage, and patches methods for testing or extension.\n  - No signs of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious code.\n  - Patching is typical for plugin development/testing, not malicious intent.\n  - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n- **Verdict**: No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, focusing on SQL lineage extraction, with dynamic imports, patching, and no evidence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The code patches extract methods and properties for extension.\n  - No network, secrets, or malicious code detected.\n  - The extensive patching could obscure flow but appears for legitimate extension.\n  - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict**: No malicious activity; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Extends and patches extractors for lineage, with dynamic patching, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The code patches methods like 'extract' and 'default_schema' for lineage purposes.\n  - No suspicious network activity or malicious code.\n  - Patch usage is typical for extension/testing.\n  - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n\n- **Verdict**: No security concerns; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Manages SQL extractors, patches methods, with focus on lineage, no malicious code or secrets.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - Patching and dynamic imports are for extension, not malicious activity.\n  - No network, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n  - The code's purpose aligns with lineage extraction.\n  - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are reasonable.\n\n- **Verdict**: No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to others, patches extractor methods for lineage, no malicious behavior or secrets.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - Extensive patching for extension/testing.\n  - No network activity, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n  - The purpose is legitimate lineage extraction.\n  - Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified.\n\n- **Verdict**: No malicious activity; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports describe code that is focused on lineage extraction, patching methods for extension or testing.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the analysis; the risk score is low but acknowledges potential for misuse in patching scenarios.\n\n### Final Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk score**: 0.2 (low, due to extensive patching and dynamic imports, which could be misused but are standard in plugin development)\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates** align with the reports:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0.2\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate extension for lineage extraction within an Airflow plugin, with no malicious intent.",
