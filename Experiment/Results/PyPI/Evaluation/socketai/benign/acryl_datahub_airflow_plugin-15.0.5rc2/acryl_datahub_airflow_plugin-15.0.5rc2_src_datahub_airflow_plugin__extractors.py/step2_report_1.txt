  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Describes extending and customizing SQL extractors for lineage collection, mainly patching methods for SQL parsing.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Reads SQL queries, operator attributes, and connection URIs; writes metadata to DataHub facets.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Uses method patching (`unittest.mock.patch`) for testing or extension, which is standard in plugin development. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious code detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate extension code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The security risk is minimal, given no malicious activity. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar focus on lineage extraction, patching extractors, and SQL parsing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Extensive use of mocking and dynamic imports, typical for extension or testing code. No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the previous, scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Extends extractors, patches methods, and handles lineage parsing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Again, extensive patching with `unittest.mock.patch`, no malicious activity or obfuscation. Patching is for customization/testing.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar focus on lineage extraction, patching extractors, and parsing SQL.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Use of patching and mocking, but nothing suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar extension and patching of extractors, focusing on lineage and metadata.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Uses dynamic method patching, typical for plugin extension/testing, no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, no obfuscation or code hiding detected.\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0.2 across all reports is reasonable, reflecting minimal risk—mainly due to extensive patching and mocking, which are typical in extension code but could be misused if misapplied.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed; the reports correctly identify the code as benign, extension-focused, and lacking malicious behavior.\n- The use of patching and mocking is typical for plugin development and testing, not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, due to patching practices, but not inherently risky)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code's purpose and behavior.",
