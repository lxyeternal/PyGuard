  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin initialization script with environment-dependent behavior and fallback mechanisms. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The risk is low but slightly elevated due to reliance on environment variables and dynamic imports, which could be exploited if environment integrity is compromised. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2."
