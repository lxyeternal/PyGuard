  "purpose": "This code initializes an Airflow plugin with environment-based configuration, conditional imports, and fallback mechanisms to ensure compatibility across different Airflow versions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (DATAHUB_AIRFLOW_PLUGIN_USE_V1_PLUGIN, DATAHUB_AIRFLOW_PLUGIN_SKIP_FORK_PATCH), dynamic imports (_get_proxy_settings, try_import_from_string), module imports based on conditions.",
  "sinks": "Potential influence of environment variables on import behavior, fallback modules, and proxy settings; no direct data leaks or malicious data flows detected.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence conditional imports and fallback logic; dynamic imports depend on environment state; exception handling ensures fallback paths.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception suppression, reliance on environment variables for critical configuration, dynamic module imports which could be manipulated if environment is compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs plugin setup with environment-driven conditional logic, dynamic imports, and fallback mechanisms. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present. The use of environment variables and dynamic imports introduces potential attack vectors if environment or modules are compromised, but these are standard practices in plugin systems. Exception handling is broad but appears intended for robustness. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin initialization script with environment-dependent behavior and fallback mechanisms. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The risk is low but slightly elevated due to reliance on environment variables and dynamic imports, which could be exploited if environment integrity is compromised. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.2.",
