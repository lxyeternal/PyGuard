  "purpose": "Define classes and functions for handling dataset and datajob URNs and their conversions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions entities_to_dataset_urn_list and entities_to_datajob_urn_list; urn property in Urn class; urn validation in _validate_urn method.",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions and urn property access; validation logic in _validate_urn.",
  "flows": "Input strings -> guess_entity_type -> urn validation and creation -> urn property access.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard validation and conversion routines; no unusual code or hidden behavior. Use of external utility functions (guess_entity_type) appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures for dataset and datajob URNs with validation to ensure correct urn format. Conversion functions filter input strings based on entity type using guess_entity_type. No suspicious or malicious logic detected. The validation enforces that URNs start with 'urn:' and are of specific types, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activities are present. External dependencies (e.g., datahub utilities) are typical for such an application and do not introduce malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for handling URNs with proper validation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly performs format validation and conversion, with no suspicious or harmful logic.",
