{
  "purpose": "The code defines configuration functions and metadata for a Python package related to an Airflow plugin for Datahub.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version (__version__), and package name (__package_name__). No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, external data handling, or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "The code only reads internal constants and returns static dictionaries and strings; there are no source-to-sink flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behaviors detected. The version string is static, and no dynamic code execution or external calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides package metadata and configuration functions. It checks whether the package is in development mode based on a static version string, and returns fixed dictionaries with connection info. There are no inputs, external data processing, or risky operations. The code structure is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration and metadata module for a Python package. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is safe and does not perform any malicious actions.",
