  "purpose": "Provides metadata and configuration information for an Airflow plugin related to Datahub integration.",
  "sources": "__version__ variable and __package_name__ variable, functions is_dev_mode(), nice_version_name(), get_provider_info()",
  "targets": "None of the code targets external systems or handles untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "The code reads version information to determine mode and provides static configuration data; no external data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no unusual or obfuscated code behavior. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and simple functions for version and provider info. It performs version string checks and returns static dictionaries. There are no external inputs, no network calls, and no data manipulation that could indicate malicious intent. The functions are simple and self-contained, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign plugin configuration script, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is standard, straightforward code used for plugin metadata and configuration.",
