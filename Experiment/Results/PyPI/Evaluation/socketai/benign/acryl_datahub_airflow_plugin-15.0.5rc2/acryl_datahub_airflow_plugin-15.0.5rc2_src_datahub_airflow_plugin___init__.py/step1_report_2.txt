{
  "purpose": "The code provides configuration information for a datahub plugin related to Airflow, including versioning and connection type details.",
  "sources": "The code reads version information (__version__) and static string literals; no external data input is read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no outputs or data leaks, and no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows involving untrusted input; functions simply return static or derived data based on internal variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are present. The code is straightforward and primarily consists of configuration data.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a package name, version, and functions that determine development mode status and provide package info. All data used are static strings or derived from internal variables. There are no external data reads, no network connections, and no code execution beyond simple string operations. No anomalies, no hidden behaviors, and no signs of malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign configuration module with no malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. It is typical of plugin metadata definitions.",
