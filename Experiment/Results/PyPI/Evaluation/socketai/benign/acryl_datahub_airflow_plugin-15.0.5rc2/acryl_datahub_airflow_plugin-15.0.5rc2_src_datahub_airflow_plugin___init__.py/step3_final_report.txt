  "purpose": "Static plugin configuration data including package metadata, version info, and connection type details.",
  "sources": "Reads internal variables (__package_name__, __version__) and returns static dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input is processed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; all data is static and internal.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static configuration module defining package metadata, versioning, and connection info. It contains no dynamic code, external input, network activity, or obfuscation. The functions return static data, and the version string indicates a release candidate, which is standard. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static configuration code with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
