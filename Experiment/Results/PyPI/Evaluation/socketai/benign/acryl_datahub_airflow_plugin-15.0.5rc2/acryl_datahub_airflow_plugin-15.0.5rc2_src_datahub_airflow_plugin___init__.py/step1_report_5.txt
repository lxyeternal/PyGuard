{
  "purpose": "Provides metadata and configuration information for the acryl-datahub-airflow-plugin package, including versioning and connection type details.",
  "sources": "The version string __version__ and the module-level constants __package_name__ and __version__.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is processed or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from sources to sinks, as the code primarily defines functions and static data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The version string '15.0.5rc2' indicates a release candidate, but this is standard versioning, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static variables for package name and version, with simple functions to check development mode and return version info. The get_provider_info() function returns a static dictionary with connection details. No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no handling of sensitive data. All functions appear safe and standard for plugin configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration and metadata module with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It serves to provide plugin info and does not interact with untrusted inputs or external systems in a harmful manner.",
