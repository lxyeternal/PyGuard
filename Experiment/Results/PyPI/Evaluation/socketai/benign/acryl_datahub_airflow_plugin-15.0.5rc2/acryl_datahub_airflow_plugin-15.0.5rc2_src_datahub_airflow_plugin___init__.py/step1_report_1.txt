  "purpose": "Provides plugin information and versioning details for the acryl-datahub-airflow-plugin package.",
  "sources": "Reads package version, the __package_name__ and __version__ variables, and returns static configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Returns a dictionary with connection types and class names; no direct sink of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads version variables -> conditionals -> returns static dictionary data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no code injection, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network calls or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines package metadata and configuration information. It includes functions to determine development mode based on version string and returns static data. No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution is present. The class names for hooks are hardcoded strings and do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard plugin configuration code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
