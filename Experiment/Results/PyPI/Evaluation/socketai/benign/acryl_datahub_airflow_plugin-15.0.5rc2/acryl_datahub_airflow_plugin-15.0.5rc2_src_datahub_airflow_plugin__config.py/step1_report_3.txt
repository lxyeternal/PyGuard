  "purpose": "Define configuration models and functions to load DataHub lineage settings for Airflow integration.",
  "sources": "conf.get() calls reading configuration values from airflow.cfg",
  "sinks": "None directly processing untrusted input; config values are from trusted airflow.cfg",
  "flows": "Configuration values are read from airflow.cfg via conf.get() and used to instantiate DatahubLineageConfig",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns detected. The code uses trusted configuration sources.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enum, data models, and configuration loading functions for DataHub integration within Airflow. It imports necessary modules, sets up configuration defaults, and reads values from airflow.cfg using conf.get(). The functions construct configuration objects with safe, predictable values. No user input or untrusted data is processed dynamically; the configuration values originate from a controlled configuration file. The code's structure is standard for configuration handling and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious logic. No backdoors, malicious code, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for DataHub within an Airflow plugin, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on trusted configuration files and performs no unsafe operations.",
