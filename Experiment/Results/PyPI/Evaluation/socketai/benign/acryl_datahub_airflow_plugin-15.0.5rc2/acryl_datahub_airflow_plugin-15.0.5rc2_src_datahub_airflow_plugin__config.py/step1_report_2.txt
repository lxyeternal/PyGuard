{
  "purpose": "The code defines configuration classes and functions for integrating DataHub lineage tracking within an Airflow environment, including loading configuration settings from airflow.cfg.",
  "sources": "Configuration values retrieved via airflow.configuration.conf.get() calls.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write data or execute untrusted inputs directly.",
  "flows": "Configuration values flow from airflow.conf into DatahubLineageConfig objects, used for configuring lineage behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code appears to handle configuration loading and data model definition in a standard, safe manner.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data models and configuration loading functions. It uses static string values, enum, and data class patterns. Sensitive information like connection IDs are handled as configuration values rather than hardcoded secrets. The only potentially dynamic element is fetching configuration parameters via conf.get(). There are no signs of code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. The code relies on external configuration files, which is typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, focusing on configuration management for DataHub lineage integration within Airflow. There are no signs of malicious or maliciously manipulated code, backdoors, or malware. It uses standard patterns for configuration handling and data modeling.",
