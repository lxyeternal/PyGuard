{
  "purpose": "This code defines configuration classes and functions for integrating DataHub lineage tracking with Airflow, including loading configuration from airflow.cfg.",
  "sources": "Configuration loading via airflow.conf, enum definitions, class attributes, and the make_emitter_hook method that dynamically imports DatahubGenericHook.",
  "sinks": "The make_emitter_hook method calls the DatahubGenericHook constructor with a connection ID, which could potentially instantiate a hook that interacts with external systems.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters like datahub_conn_id and environment variables influence connection setup; the dynamic import and instantiation of DatahubGenericHook could lead to external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import within a method; reliance on external configuration; no hardcoded credentials; no unusual or suspicious code patterns; configuration loading appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines data classes and configuration loading functions with standard practices. The dynamic import within make_emitter_hook could potentially lead to external system interaction, but it is a controlled import of a known class. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are present. The code does not contain obfuscation or suspicious behavior. The connection to external systems via configuration is typical for such integrations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration setup for DataHub integration with Airflow. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware is detected. It follows typical patterns for loading configurations and instantiating hooks. The overall security risk is very low.",
