{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, primarily reading package metadata from __init__.py, defining dependencies, and configuring package installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ variable and other metadata via exec() from './src/datahub_airflow_plugin/__init__.py'; reads README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or network activity; static dependencies and metadata are used.",
  "flows": "exec() executes code from a local trusted file to extract __version__; dependencies are constructed from internal variables without external input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load metadata, which can be risky if the source file is compromised; no external input or dynamic code execution from untrusted sources.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with the only notable pattern being the use of exec() to load metadata. This pattern is common but can pose security risks if the source files are malicious or tampered with. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. Dependency strings are static and internally constructed. The use of exec() warrants caution but is acceptable in trusted build environments. The overall structure is straightforward, and no suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary concern is the use of exec() to load metadata, which should be trusted in controlled environments. Scores of malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate given the context.",
