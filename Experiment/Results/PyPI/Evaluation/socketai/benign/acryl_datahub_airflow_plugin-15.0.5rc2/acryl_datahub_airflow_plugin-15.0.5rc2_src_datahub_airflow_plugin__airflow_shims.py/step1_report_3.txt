{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility and utility functions for working with Apache Airflow operators and sensors, specifically managing differences across Airflow versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version parsing, conditional imports, and attribute access within functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; the code mainly handles internal logic and compatibility.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted inputs; the code primarily performs version checks and attribute access.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The use of dynamic attribute access is standard for compatibility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and handles missing imports gracefully. It parses version info for Airflow and pluggy, then defines utility functions to access inlets and outlets from operators, considering API differences across versions. The functions perform attribute checks and fallback to default values. No data is read from external sources, no user inputs, or network calls are made. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a version compatibility utility for Airflow plugins, performing standard operations such as imports, version checks, and attribute access with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
