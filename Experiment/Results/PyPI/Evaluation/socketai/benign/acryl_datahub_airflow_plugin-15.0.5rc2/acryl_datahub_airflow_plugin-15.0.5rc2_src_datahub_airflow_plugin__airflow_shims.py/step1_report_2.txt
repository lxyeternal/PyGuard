{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up compatibility and utility functions for integrating with Apache Airflow, handling version-specific differences and importing relevant classes and modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from airflow, packaging, and pluggy; version variables; attribute checks and method calls within get_task_inlets and get_task_outlets.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks are present; no untrusted data is written, executed, or sent over a network.",
  "flows": "The code imports and checks for modules and attributes, then defines utility functions that access object attributes related to Airflow operators, without executing or manipulating untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution or malicious logic. The code mostly performs version checks and attribute access.",
  "analysis": "The script performs conditional imports based on module availability, version parsing, and attribute checks. The functions get_task_inlets and get_task_outlets access operator attributes to retrieve inlet and outlet definitions. These operations are standard and do not involve untrusted data processing or any malicious activity. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The only potential concern might be dynamic attribute access, but it is used here in a safe context for compatibility purposes. Overall, the code functions as a compatibility layer and utility module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility and utility setup for Airflow operators, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs version checks and safe attribute access, with no suspicious activity observed.",
