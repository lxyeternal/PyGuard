  "purpose": "Compatibility utility for handling differences across Airflow versions, managing imports and attribute access for operators and sensors.",
  "sources": "Imports airflow.version, packaging.version, pluggy, airflow models, and conditional imports of external modules; version parsing and attribute checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "Version parsing leads to feature flag assignments; attribute checks determine method returns; no data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard compatibility checks using version parsing, try-except for optional imports, and attribute existence checks for backward compatibility. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It is a straightforward utility module for managing differences in Airflow versions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its purpose and safety. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0, obfuscation is 0, and confidence is high.",
