{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility and utility functions for working with Airflow operators, sensors, and versioning across different Airflow versions.",
  "sources": "Imports from airflow and external modules, attribute access on operator objects, version parsing, and feature flag assignments based on version checks.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code primarily imports modules, performs attribute checks, and assigns variables based on conditions without executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code reads version info and attributes from operator objects to determine their capabilities, but does not process or execute external or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. The code performs version compatibility checks and attribute inspections in a standard manner.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple airflow modules and handles conditional imports based on the environment. It asserts that a specific Airflow patch is applied, then parses version numbers for Airflow and pluggy. It sets feature flags based on these versions. Functions to retrieve inlets and outlets from operator objects check for attributes that vary between versions, ensuring compatibility. All operations are standard and do not execute or evaluate untrusted input. No malicious behavior or malware patterns are evident. The code’s structure, attribute access, and version handling are typical for compatibility layers and do not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility and utility module for Airflow, involving version checks and attribute retrievals. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malware. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured piece of code intended to support different Airflow versions.",
