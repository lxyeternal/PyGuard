  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a compatibility utility for Airflow, with imports and version checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or untrusted data flow; purely version and attribute checks.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The functions `get_task_inlets` and `get_task_outlets` access attributes with fallbacks, standard for compatibility code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risks detected.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is a compatibility utility with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; correctly notes the code handles module imports and version parsing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Attribute access is safe and standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; the code is a straightforward compatibility layer.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as handling version differences.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious logic.\n- **Analysis:** Attribute checks and version parsing are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; the code is a typical compatibility utility.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as managing version compatibility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** The code performs safe attribute access and version checks.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; the code appears safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the code's role in version and attribute handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Standard version parsing, attribute checks, and import handling.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is present and matches the original.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No malware or obfuscation detected across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** No evidence of security risks, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Functionality:** The code is a compatibility and utility module for Airflow, performing version checks and safe attribute access.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low; standard compatibility code, no evident security issues)\n\n**Note:** The original code is straightforward, well-structured, and performs common compatibility tasks without any malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard compatibility utility for Airflow, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are consistent with this assessment.",
