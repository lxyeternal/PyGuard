  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, correlating their conclusions with the code content, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a compatibility utility for Airflow, with imports and version checks.\n- **Logic & Behavior:** No data processing, no untrusted data handling, no network activity.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully aligns with the code's purpose; high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion that the code is benign and intended for compatibility is accurate. The malware score should remain **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; correctly identifies the code as a compatibility layer.\n- **Logic & Behavior:** No untrusted data, no external calls, no malicious logic.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues detected. Malware score remains **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's role in version compatibility.\n- **Logic & Behavior:** No data flows to untrusted sources, no network activity.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid assessment.\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears safe; malware score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the code handles version differences via imports and attribute checks.\n- **Logic & Behavior:** No untrusted data processing or external communication.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Consistent with the code's intent.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a standard compatibility utility; malware score remains **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as version compatibility and attribute access functions.\n- **Logic & Behavior:** No data flows to external or untrusted sources; no network calls.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is benign; malware score should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree there are no malicious behaviors. The code performs version checks, conditional imports, and attribute access, all standard for compatibility layers.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or complex obfuscation patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity, the overall security risk is minimal.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured compatibility utility for Airflow, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as such.",
