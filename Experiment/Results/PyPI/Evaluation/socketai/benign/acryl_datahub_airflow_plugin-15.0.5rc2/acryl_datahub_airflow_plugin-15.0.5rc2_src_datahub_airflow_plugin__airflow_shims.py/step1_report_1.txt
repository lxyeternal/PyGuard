{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a compatibility and utility module for Airflow operators and sensors, providing version checks and helper functions to handle different Airflow versions.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (`airflow`, `packaging`, `pluggy`), local modules (`_airflow_compat`), and conditional imports based on module availability.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flow, as the code primarily defines constants, imports, and simple functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Conditional imports and version checks are standard practices for compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The script performs version parsing and conditional import strategies to handle different Airflow versions, which is typical for maintaining compatibility. The functions `get_task_inlets` and `get_task_outlets` access operator attributes with fallback mechanisms based on version differences, which are standard practices in version-dependent code. No external network calls, data leaks, or malicious logic are present. The code does not manipulate untrusted data or perform unsafe operations. Overall, the code appears legitimate, intended for compatibility management within an Airflow plugin context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a compatibility utility for Airflow, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It contains no suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious intent. The structure and purpose align with standard plugin or utility module patterns.",
