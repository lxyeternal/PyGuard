  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a compatibility utility for Airflow, handling version differences, conditional imports, and attribute access for operators and sensors.\n- They consistently find no suspicious behavior, no external data processing, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n- The functions `get_task_inlets` and `get_task_outlets` use attribute checks and fallbacks, which are standard for maintaining compatibility across versions.\n- The code performs version parsing and feature flag assignments, which are typical for such utility modules.\n- No report indicates any malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does not contain any malware, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior.\n- The version checks and conditional imports are standard practices.\n- The attribute access patterns are safe and intended for compatibility.\n- No evidence of data leaks, untrusted data handling, or external network activity.\n\n**Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n- No issues are identified; all reports agree on the benign nature.\n- The only minor point is that the code relies on attribute existence checks, but this is standard and safe in this context.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — Code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard compatibility utility for an Airflow plugin or core module.\n- It performs version-dependent attribute access and import handling safely.\n- There are no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious behavior.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Final note:** The code is well-structured, safe, and serves a clear purpose without any security concerns.",
