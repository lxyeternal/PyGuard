  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code to determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of the scores, and whether any suspicious activity is present.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- Purpose: Compatibility layer for different Airflow versions, handling imports, attribute access, and feature flags.\n- Behavior: Performs version checks, conditional imports, and attribute access with fallbacks.\n- Security implications: No data processing, no external network activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review of Each Report\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a compatibility utility.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately states that the code handles version parsing, conditional imports, and safe attribute access, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the import and version handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Recognizes that the code performs safe attribute access and version checks, with no untrusted data processing.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes version-dependent attribute access.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Identifies the code as a compatibility utility with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the import and version parsing.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no signs of malicious behavior, with standard version and attribute handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly less confident but still accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately states the code's role in version compatibility.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and recognizes the code as a standard compatibility layer.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation & Final Judgment\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a compatibility utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are zero, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are zero, indicating no security risks. This is appropriate given the code's straightforward purpose.\n- **Confidence Levels:** All are high, reflecting the clear, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential concerns:**  \nNo evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The code is standard for maintaining compatibility across different versions of a dependency.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n**Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Note:** These scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the reviews.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured compatibility utility for Airflow, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and appropriate.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores—no adjustments needed. The code is safe and does not pose a supply chain security threat.",
