{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility utilities for interacting with different versions of Apache Airflow and related dependencies, facilitating version-dependent attribute access and import handling.",
  "sources": "Imports external libraries (airflow, packaging, pluggy), and retrieves Airflow version info from the airflow.version module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present; the code primarily defines functions and constants for internal use.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines functions for version compatibility and attribute retrieval, with no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic are present. The code is standard for compatibility handling, with typical try-except import patterns and version comparisons.",
  "analysis": "The code imports essential libraries, handles optional imports with exception handling, and sets version-dependent flags for Airflow features. Functions for retrieving task inlets and outlets adapt to different Airflow versions, based on attribute existence checks. All logic appears standard, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or unusual behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical compatibility utility module for managing different Airflow versions. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for internal version management purposes.",
