  "purpose": "Integrate and hook into Airflow task and DAG run events via a plugin listener.",
  "sources": "Import statements from datahub_airflow_plugin and function calls to get_airflow_plugin_listener.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to _listener's event handlers (on_task_instance_running, on_task_instance_success, etc.).",
  "flows": "Code obtains _listener, then invokes its methods during specific Airflow events.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation present. Use of assertions for _listener presence is standard. No network, file, or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a plugin interface, retrieves a listener object, and registers several event hooks that invoke methods on this listener. All operations are straightforward, involving method calls based on events. No data manipulation, network activity, or hidden actions are evident. The use of assertions ensures the listener exists before calling its methods, which is standard for such hook implementations. No anomalies, malicious code, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard event hook registration for an Airflow plugin, calling methods on a listener object during task and DAG run events. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
