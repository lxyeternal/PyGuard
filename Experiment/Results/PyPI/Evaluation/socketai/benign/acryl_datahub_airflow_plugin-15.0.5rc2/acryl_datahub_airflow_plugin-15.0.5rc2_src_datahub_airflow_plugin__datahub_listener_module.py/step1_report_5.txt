{
  "purpose": "The code sets up plugin hooks for Airflow task and DAG run events, delegating to a listener object obtained from an external module.",
  "sources": "Function calls to get_airflow_plugin_listener(), attribute checks like hasattr(_listener, \"on_dag_run_running\"), and hook function definitions that receive parameters from Airflow events.",
  "sinks": "Calling methods on _listener such as on_task_instance_running, on_task_instance_success, on_task_instance_failed, and on_dag_run_running, which may process event data.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves the listener object, then upon certain Airflow events, calls corresponding methods on _listener with event data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. Use of assert statements for runtime checks is typical. No evidence of malicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a listener object from an external module, then conditionally defines hook functions that invoke methods on this listener during Airflow task and DAG events. These functions are standard plugin hooks. No input validation or data sanitization issues are apparent. The code relies on external behavior, but nothing indicates malicious intent. The use of asserts is a standard practice for runtime checks, not security risks. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The code appears to be a straightforward plugin setup for monitoring or extending Airflow functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard plugin hook implementation for Airflow, delegating event handling to an external listener. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this code fragment.",
