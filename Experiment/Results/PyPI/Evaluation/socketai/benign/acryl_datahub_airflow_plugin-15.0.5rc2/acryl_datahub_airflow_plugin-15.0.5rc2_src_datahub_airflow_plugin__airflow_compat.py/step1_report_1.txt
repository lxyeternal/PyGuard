  "purpose": "Set a module-level flag indicating that the DataHub utilities patch has been applied, and ensure it is imported before any Airflow-related code.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'MARKUPSAFE_PATCHED' from datahub.utilities._markupsafe_compat, and the assertion checking its truth value.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output.",
  "flows": "Import of 'MARKUPSAFE_PATCHED' → assertion confirming its value → setting of AIRFLOW_PATCHED flag",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a self-contained assertion that enforces the presence of 'MARKUPSAFE_PATCHED', but it does not do anything suspicious such as executing external commands, handling user input, or processing sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific variable from a module and asserts its truth value, likely to ensure proper patching or configuration state before proceeding with Airflow tasks. The use of a simple assert statement on a variable imported from a utility module is straightforward and does not indicate malicious behavior. The only notable aspect is its dependency on external modules, but nothing here suggests malicious intent. The code is minimal and well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration/setup snippet that enforces the presence of a specific patched state before proceeding. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
