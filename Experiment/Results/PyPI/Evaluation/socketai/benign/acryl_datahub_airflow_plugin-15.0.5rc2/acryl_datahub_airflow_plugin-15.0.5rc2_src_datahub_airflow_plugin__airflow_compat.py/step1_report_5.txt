  "purpose": "Set a flag indicating that the environment has been patched for Airflow and ensure compatibility with MarkupSafe.",
  "sources": "Import from 'datahub.utilities._markupsafe_compat' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurring that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities",
  "flows": "Import -> assertion -> setting a module-level constant",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; simple flag setting and import statements",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific attribute from a compatibility module, asserts its presence to ensure the patch is applied, and sets a boolean flag. No untrusted data handling, no external network activity, and no dynamic code execution. The purpose appears to be setting a flag for environment setup with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, related to environment setup and compatibility adjustments, with no malicious or security-risk behavior detected.",
