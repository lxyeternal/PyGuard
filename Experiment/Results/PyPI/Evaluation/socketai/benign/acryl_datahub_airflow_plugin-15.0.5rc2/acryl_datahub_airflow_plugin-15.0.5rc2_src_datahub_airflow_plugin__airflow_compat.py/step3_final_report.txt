{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a setup or patch verification snippet, ensuring that the 'MARKUPSAFE_PATCHED' flag is set before proceeding with other operations, particularly related to Airflow compatibility.",
  "sources": "Imports 'MARKUPSAFE_PATCHED' from an internal utility module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "Import of 'MARKUPSAFE_PATCHED' -> assertion check -> setting 'AIRFLOW_PATCHED' -> export via '__all__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and performs a standard precondition check.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a variable indicating a patch state, asserts its truthiness to verify the patch is applied, and sets a module-level flag for environment configuration. It does not handle user input, execute external commands, or process untrusted data. The assertion ensures the environment is correctly patched before further execution. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is benign environment setup, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment configuration snippet used for ensuring a patch has been applied. It poses no security risk or malicious behavior, and the scores assigned in the reports (malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, security risk 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's function.",
