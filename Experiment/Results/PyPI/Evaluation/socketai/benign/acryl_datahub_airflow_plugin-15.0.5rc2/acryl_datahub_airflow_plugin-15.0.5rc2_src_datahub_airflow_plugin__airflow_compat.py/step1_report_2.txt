{
  "purpose": "Set up a module to be imported before Airflow modules to ensure compatibility or patching, and define a constant for this purpose.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'MARKUPSAFE_PATCHED' from a utility module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no user input or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'MARKUPSAFE_PATCHED' -> Assertion of its truth -> Setting 'AIRFLOW_PATCHED' -> Exporting via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an assert statement to verify a patched or compatibility variable, which is standard for ensuring preconditions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes a module-level constant and verifies a patch/compatibility condition. The import source is from a utility module, and the assert ensures 'MARKUPSAFE_PATCHED' is True before proceeding. No dynamic code execution, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is observed. The structure is straightforward and aligns with typical compatibility patching practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears to serve a compatibility or patching purpose related to Airflow and MarkupSafe. No malicious activity, suspicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
