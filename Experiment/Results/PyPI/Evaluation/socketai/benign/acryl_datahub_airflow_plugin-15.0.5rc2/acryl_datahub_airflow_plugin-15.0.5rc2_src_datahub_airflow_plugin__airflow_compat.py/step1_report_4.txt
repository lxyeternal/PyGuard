{
  "purpose": "The code sets a patch indicator for compatibility with Airflow and ensures a dependency is imported before any Airflow-related code executes.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'MARKUPSAFE_PATCHED' from 'datahub.utilities._markupsafe_compat', assertion checking its value, and setting the AIRFLOW_PATCHED flag.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data processing or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "The import and assertion establish the state of 'MARKUPSAFE_PATCHED' before setting 'AIRFLOW_PATCHED', with no data flow beyond internal variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward. No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. The import relies on an internal module, but that in itself is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code's main function is to import a specific variable from an internal module and assert its value, then set a flag. There are no data inputs, external communications, or complex logic. The purpose appears to be ensuring that a compatibility patch is in place before other code executes. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscated behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, intended for compatibility patching, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe and aligns with typical compatibility handling in Python projects.",
