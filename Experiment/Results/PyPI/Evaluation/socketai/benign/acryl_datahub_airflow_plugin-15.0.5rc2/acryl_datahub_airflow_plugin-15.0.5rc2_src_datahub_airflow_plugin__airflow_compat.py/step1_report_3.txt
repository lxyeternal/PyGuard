  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Import of 'MARKUPSAFE_PATCHED' -> Assertion check -> Setting 'AIRFLOW_PATCHED' flag.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a variable and asserts its truthiness, then sets a flag. This pattern is typical for ensuring import side-effects occur before other code runs. No external input, data leakage, or malicious behavior is observed. The module appears to serve a configuration or patching purpose with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for import order and patch management. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
