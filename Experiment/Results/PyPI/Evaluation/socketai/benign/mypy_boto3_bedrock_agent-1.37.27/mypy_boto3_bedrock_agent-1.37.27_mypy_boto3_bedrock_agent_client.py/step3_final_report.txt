{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the AWS 'bedrock-agent' SDK, providing method signatures and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (kwargs) and responses; no dynamic or untrusted data processing beyond standard API interactions.",
  "sinks": "API call parameters and responses; no execution of untrusted data or code injection points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method input kwargs to API calls and back; no internal logic or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors; standard SDK pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, type-annotated SDK stub for AWS 'bedrock-agent', with method signatures wrapping API calls. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious data handling is present. The only potential concern is that some methods accept untrusted input, which is inherent to SDKs designed for user interaction with AWS services, not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SDK interface with no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects typical SDK usage, and malware score remains zero. The assessments across all reports are consistent and accurate.",
