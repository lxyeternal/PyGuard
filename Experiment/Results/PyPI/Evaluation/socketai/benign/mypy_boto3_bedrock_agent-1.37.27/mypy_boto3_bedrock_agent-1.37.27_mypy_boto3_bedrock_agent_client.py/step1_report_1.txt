{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the 'bedrock-agent' service in boto3, enabling type-checked interaction with AWS Bedrock Agent API.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; property and overload annotations.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters and return types, particularly in methods accepting or returning untrusted data (e.g., **kwargs, Mapping, Dict).",
  "flows": "Untrusted input via **kwargs flows into client method calls and property/method parameters; responses and exceptions are returned or raised.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hard-coded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Use of standard boto3 and botocore patterns; no suspicious network activity or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a client class with numerous methods for AWS service interactions, employing type annotations, overloads for paginators, and exception handling. It imports standard libraries and local modules, and no code executes malicious actions. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code paths are found. The structure aligns with typical AWS SDK stub implementations. The untrusted data flows are limited to method parameters and response types, consistent with SDK usage. No malicious payloads or indicators of sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, type-annotated SDK interface for AWS Bedrock Agent service, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK stub, providing type hints for AWS API interactions without executing or embedding any malicious code.",
