  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential code issues, logical flaws, security risks, and consistency with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as type annotations and client interface for 'bedrock-agent'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes that data flows through method parameters and responses; no execution of untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Finds no suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states that the code is a standard SDK stub with no malicious intent, with high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is a typical, well-structured SDK interface with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly describes the code as type annotations and client class.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No actual data processing, only method signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard SDK interface, with full confidence (1.0).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code provides a typed interface for AWS 'bedrock-agent'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Notes potential data flows from kwargs to API calls but no dangerous logic.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly concludes it's a standard SDK wrapper, with high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as type annotations and a client class.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes that untrusted data flows via kwargs, but this is typical for SDK clients.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious logic or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly states it's a safe, type-safe API wrapper, with high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malware or sabotage detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states it's a type-annotated SDK interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No internal data processing, just method signatures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurately describes the code as a legitimate SDK component, with full confidence (1.0).\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports agree that the code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface.\n- **Malware or malicious activity:** No evidence. All reports confirm the absence of backdoors, hidden code, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** Minimal; inherent to SDK design is the acceptance of untrusted input, but this is standard and not malicious.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — typical SDK interface, low risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, type-annotated SDK stub for AWS 'bedrock-agent'. It poses no security threat or malicious intent. The high confidence in these assessments is justified by the code's structure and the reports' analyses.\n\n---\n\n**Work out any further concerns?** No. The code appears safe and standard.",
