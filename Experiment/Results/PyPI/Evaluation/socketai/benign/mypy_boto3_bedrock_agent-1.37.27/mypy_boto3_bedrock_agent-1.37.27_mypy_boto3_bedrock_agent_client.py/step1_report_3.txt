{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the 'bedrock-agent' AWS service, providing a typed interface for API interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from system modules, boto3, botocore, and local modules; class method definitions, including request/response types, and paginator overloads.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that accept or return untrusted data (e.g., kwargs, mappings), potentially leading to code execution or data leaks if misused.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (kwargs, mappings) through method calls to AWS API endpoints, with type annotations ensuring structured data passing; no evident dangerous flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code constructs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The class mainly provides API wrappers with clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a typed client for AWS's 'bedrock-agent' service, including methods that wrap API calls, paginator overloads, and exception classes. It imports relevant types, sets up method signatures, and overloads for paginators. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as hidden backdoors, network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code adheres to standard SDK interface patterns, focusing on type safety and API interaction facilitation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface implementation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It provides a comprehensive typed API wrapper for the 'bedrock-agent' service without suspicious or harmful logic.",
