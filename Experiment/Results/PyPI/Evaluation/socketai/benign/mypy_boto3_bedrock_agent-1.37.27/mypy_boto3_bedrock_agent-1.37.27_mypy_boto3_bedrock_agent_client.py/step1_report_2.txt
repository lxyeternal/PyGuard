{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class for interacting with the bedrock-agent service in AWS, providing method signatures and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party botocore and typing modules, and local modules for type definitions and paginators.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations are stubs returning type hints; no actual data processing or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Method signatures indicate data flows from method calls with parameters unpacked from request types to responses, but no runtime code execution or data processing logic is present.",
  "anomalies": "No signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code is purely declarative with method signatures and documentation. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard type annotation and client interface setup for the AWS bedrock-agent service, using Python typing and overloads for paginators. It contains no executable logic, only method signatures with detailed documentation references. The import structure accounts for Python version differences, and the class provides interface definitions aligned with boto3 conventions. No anomalous or malicious behaviors are observable in this static structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK interface definition with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It serves as a type-safe wrapper for the AWS bedrock-agent API, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
