  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the 'bedrock-agent' service in boto3, providing type-safe access to API operations.",
  "sources": "The entire code, especially method definitions, imports, and class properties that access API operations, paginators, and exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Method calls that could potentially send untrusted data if improperly used, especially generate_presigned_url, tag_resource, untag_resource, and any methods that accept unvalidated input parameters.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from **kwargs** in API methods flows into API calls. Notably, generate_presigned_url uses parameters that could be manipulated. Tag and untag resource methods accept resource identifiers and tags that could be misused.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious dynamic code execution; no obfuscated code or suspicious strings; method signatures follow expected patterns. No unexpected network calls or file operations are present. The code appears to be a standard SDK wrapper with type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive type stub and client class for the boto3 'bedrock-agent' service. It defines method signatures with detailed type annotations, including request and response types, paginator overloads, and exception classes. There are no signs of malicious logic such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The methods are wrappers for API calls, with parameters and responses clearly annotated. The code structure and content are consistent with a standard SDK definition. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected, and the code primarily serves as a type-safe interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, type-annotated SDK wrapper for the 'bedrock-agent' AWS service. It contains no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The only potential security concern involves methods accepting untrusted input that could be misused if the SDK is used improperly, but this is inherent to any API client interface and not indicative of malicious intent.",
