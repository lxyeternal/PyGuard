  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the actual code.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Describes the module as a main interface for bedrock-agent, providing imports and setup.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no untrusted data, no malicious patterns. The code is just import statements, class aliases, and documentation.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a straightforward interface module with no security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, emphasizing the organization and documentation.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data sinks, no data flow involving external input, standard imports.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — the risk score is slightly above zero, but given the benign nature, it should be 0 or very close to it. The report's reasoning aligns with this.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines the interface, imports, and documentation.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious code, standard package structure.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No security concerns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, focusing on imports and documentation.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data, no network operations, standard SDK setup.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar overview.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no untrusted data, standard SDK wrapper.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign, straightforward interface module.\n- No malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The only minor point is the slightly elevated risk score in Report 2 (0.1), which is unjustified given the code's nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk, as the code is purely structural and documentation.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or handle secrets.\n- The usage example is only in the docstring and does not execute during import.\n- The module's purpose is to re-export classes and provide documentation, typical for SDK interface layers.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI recommend setting the **malware score to 0**, **obfuscated to 0**, and **risk score to 0** for this code, reflecting its benign and standard nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
