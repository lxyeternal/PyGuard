  "purpose": "Main interface module for bedrock-agent service, providing imports and client setup for interacting with AWS bedrock-agent components.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules (.client and .paginator), and the inline docstring with usage example.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily defines class imports and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; code mainly initializes class references and documents usage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns. The docstring includes an extensive usage example but no executable code that handles data or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, class aliasing, a detailed usage docstring, and the __all__ declaration. It does not process user input or handle sensitive data. No malicious patterns or obfuscated code detected. The module appears to be a straightforward interface layer for a larger SDK or library, with no indications of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module for importing client classes and paginators for the bedrock-agent SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious or obfuscated code, and no evident security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
