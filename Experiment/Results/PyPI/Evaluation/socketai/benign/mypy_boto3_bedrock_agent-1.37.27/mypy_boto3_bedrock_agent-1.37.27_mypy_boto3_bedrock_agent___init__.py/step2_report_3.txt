  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the module as a main interface for bedrock-agent SDK, with documentation and usage example.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing or data flow issues.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, consisting of imports, documentation, and class re-exports. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Overall assessment aligns.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the module's role in defining the interface, with standard import sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is mainly documentation, imports, and exports, typical for an SDK interface. No vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (slightly above zero but justified as minimal risk).\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning is sound; the slightly elevated securityRisk score seems acceptable given the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the module as an import/export interface with documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard module with no malicious behavior, no dynamic code, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The assessment is consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the module's role in importing classes and providing documentation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical SDK interface module, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-founded assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the module as an interface for AWS-like services.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward wrapper with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code does not process untrusted input or perform network operations.\n- **Malware score justification:** All reports agree on zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk score:** Slightly above zero in report 2 (0.1), justified by the minimal inherent risk of SDK interface code, but overall negligible.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.05** (very low, given it's a simple interface module with no processing or data handling)\n\nThis module appears to be a benign, standard SDK interface layer with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and well-justified. The code is a typical SDK interface module with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening behavior. The low risk score reflects its benign nature.",
