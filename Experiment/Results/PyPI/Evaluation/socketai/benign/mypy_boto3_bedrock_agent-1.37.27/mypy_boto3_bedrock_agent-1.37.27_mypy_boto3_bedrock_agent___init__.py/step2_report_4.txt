  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Report 1**:\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correctly identifies that the code is an interface module with documentation and usage examples.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Appropriately notes the absence of data processing, secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment**: The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward, and the scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Report 2**:\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Similar to Report 1, it recognizes the module as an interface with documentation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Correctly states no data flow from untrusted sources and no suspicious code.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n- **Assessment**: The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 is reasonable, given no evident risks. The malware score remains zero.\n\n**Report 3**:\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Recognizes the module as an import/export setup with documentation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: Appropriately notes the absence of malicious code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment**: The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 4**:\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Correctly identifies the module as an interface with documentation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: No signs of malicious activity or data mishandling.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment**: Appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Report 5**:\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Recognizes the module as a straightforward SDK interface.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion**: No malicious behavior or security risks identified.\n- **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment**: Consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: No obfuscation detected; 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score**: Slightly above zero in one report (0.1), which is reasonable given the module's nature as an interface layer with no processing of untrusted data.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- The code is benign, with no hidden malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0.05 (very low, just to acknowledge minimal potential risk, e.g., misconfiguration, but none evident here)\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is a standard, safe SDK interface module with no security concerns.",
