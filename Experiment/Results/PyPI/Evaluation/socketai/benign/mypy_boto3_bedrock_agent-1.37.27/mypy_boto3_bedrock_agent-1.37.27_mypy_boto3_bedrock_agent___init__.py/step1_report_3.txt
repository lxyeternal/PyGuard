{
  "purpose": "Defines the main interface and imports for the bedrock-agent service, providing type annotations and re-exports for client and paginator classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator), module docstring, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; the code primarily imports and exports classes and functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code structure involves static imports and definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard module imports, a detailed docstring with usage examples, and re-exporting of classes and functions for external use. It appears to be a straightforward package interface file with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. No external data sources or sinks are utilized, and the code adheres to common Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a typical package interface module with no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected. It mainly manages imports and documentation for the package, presenting no apparent security risks.",
