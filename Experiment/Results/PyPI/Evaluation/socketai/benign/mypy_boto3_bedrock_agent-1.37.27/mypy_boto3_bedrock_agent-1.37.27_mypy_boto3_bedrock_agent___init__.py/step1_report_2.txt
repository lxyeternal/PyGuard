{
  "purpose": "Define and organize the main interface for the bedrock-agent service, including documentation, usage examples, imports, and exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statements, including the current module's relative imports, and the docstring which contains usage examples.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or outputted in an insecure manner.",
  "flows": "The code flows from import statements to module exports, with no data flow paths involving untrusted input or external data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual constructs are present. The documentation and import structure appear standard for a Python SDK interface.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of documentation, import statements, and module exports. The docstring provides usage examples for a client interacting with AWS-like services. Imports are standard relative imports of client and paginator classes. There are no code execution, data processing, or network communication functionalities directly implemented that could be exploited. The structure is typical for a Python package module defining an API interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign module setting up the SDK interface with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It mainly defines imports and exports for other components. No security risks are identified.",
