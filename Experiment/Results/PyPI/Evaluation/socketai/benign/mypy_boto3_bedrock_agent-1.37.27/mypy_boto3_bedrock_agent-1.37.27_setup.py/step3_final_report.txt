  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-bedrock-agent library.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no network activity or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, conventional setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports only necessary modules, reads a local README file, and calls setuptools.setup() with static, hardcoded package information. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, untrusted input handling, or suspicious patterns. All five expert reports concur that the script is benign, with high confidence, and assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0.0. The code follows standard packaging practices and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior and pose no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assess it as safe, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
