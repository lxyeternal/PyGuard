{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up and packaging the Python project 'mypy-boto3-bedrock-agent' with metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup from setuptools, and specifying package and dependency information.",
  "targets": "No untrusted input sources; static configuration data only.",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup configuration is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging, containing no input handling, no network or system calls, nor dynamic code execution. All data is static and intended for packaging purposes. The only potential concern would be reading a local README.md file, but this is typical for setup scripts and not suspicious. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and contains no indicators of malware or malicious activity.",
