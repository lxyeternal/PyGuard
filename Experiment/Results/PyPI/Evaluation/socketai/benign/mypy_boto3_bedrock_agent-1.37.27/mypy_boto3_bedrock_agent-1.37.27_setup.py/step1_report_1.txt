{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-bedrock-agent package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; no network, file write, or command execution occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads local file (README.md) to set description; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and setuptools for packaging. It reads the README.md file for long description, then calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and URLs. All operations are standard for Python package setup, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation from untrusted sources. The dependencies are explicitly specified, and no environment variables or user inputs are used to influence behavior. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a benign package configuration file.",
