  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-bedrock-agent', defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description; reads package data; defines static strings for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs detected.",
  "flows": "Static strings and file reading operations flow into package setup parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is straightforward package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and uses setuptools to define package metadata. It reads the README.md file for long description. All data is static or file-based. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks. It performs typical package configuration tasks securely.",
