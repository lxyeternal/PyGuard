  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the Python module 'mypy-boto3-bedrock-agent'.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long_description, imports setup from setuptools, and defines static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static metadata is used with no dynamic or external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed. The script performs standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script. It imports standard libraries, reads a README file for the long description, and calls setup() with fixed metadata. No input validation, dynamic code execution, or network operations are present. The code structure aligns with common packaging practices. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalous behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided script is a benign, standard setup configuration for packaging a Python module. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
