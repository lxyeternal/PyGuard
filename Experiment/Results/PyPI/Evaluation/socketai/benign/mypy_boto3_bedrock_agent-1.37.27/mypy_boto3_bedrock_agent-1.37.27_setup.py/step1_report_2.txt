  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-bedrock-agent Python module with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of README.md from the filesystem for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; setup() call uses static values.",
  "flows": "File read for long_description flows into the setup() configuration, which is standard.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward package setup: imports Path for filesystem access, reads a static README.md file for description, and calls setuptools.setup() with static, hardcoded package metadata and dependencies. All inputs and outputs are static or filesystem-based, with no external data or untrusted input involved. The code follows typical Python packaging patterns without suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package. It contains no malicious behavior or supply chain risks. It simply reads a markdown file and calls setup() with static data, which is common in Python package distribution.",
