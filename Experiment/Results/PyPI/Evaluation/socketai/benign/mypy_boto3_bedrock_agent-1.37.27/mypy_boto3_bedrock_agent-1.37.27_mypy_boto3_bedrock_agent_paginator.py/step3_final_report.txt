{
  "purpose": "Defines paginator classes for the 'bedrock-agent' service with type annotations, inheriting from a generic Paginator, providing paginate methods that accept unpacked request parameters.",
  "sources": "The 'kwargs' in 'paginate' methods, which are unpacked and passed to the parent Paginator; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "The unpacked 'kwargs' are used internally within the method to generate pages; no data is transmitted externally or to untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are unpacked and fed into the base 'paginate' method, resulting in page iteration; no external data flow or network activity is present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, boilerplate for SDK type safety.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for boto3 paginator wrappers, with type annotations and documentation links. The 'paginate' methods accept flexible arguments via 'Unpack[...]' and delegate to the base class. No external data, network calls, or malicious behavior are evident. The structure is standard for SDK stubs, with conditional imports for compatibility. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK boilerplate for boto3 pagination classes, with no malicious intent or security issues. It is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal.",
