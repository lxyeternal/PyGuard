  "purpose": "Define paginator classes for various 'bedrock-agent' service client operations with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class definitions, and method implementations, especially in 'paginate' methods and class inheritance logic.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods potentially handle untrusted keyword arguments (**kwargs) which are unpacked with Unpack, but the code does not process or execute these arguments directly; the source of data is not explicitly specified but may originate from external API calls.",
  "flows": "Input data (kwargs) flows into 'paginate' methods, which pass them to the underlying Paginator class without manipulation; no evident data flow to external systems or networks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'Unpack' with **kwargs in 'paginate' methods; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed; code structure is standard for boto3 stubs; no suspicious file operations, network calls, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for the 'bedrock-agent' service with type annotations for better static analysis. Each paginator class inherits from a generic Paginator with specific response types. The 'paginate' methods accept **kwargs with type Unpack[...] to allow flexible argument passing aligned with boto3's paginator API. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code relies on external boto3 and botocore modules for core functionality, with no evidence of malicious payloads or suspicious patterns. The dynamic use of **kwargs is typical for such API wrapper code and does not in itself indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of boto3 paginator class definitions for type-safe API interactions. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected. The use of 'Unpack' in method signatures is consistent with boto3's design and does not pose a security threat.",
