{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the bedrock-agent service client in boto3, facilitating pagination over various resources.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class methods and type annotations, especially in paginate methods.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs unpacked into request types, but they do not process untrusted data or perform data leaks; no sinks for untrusted input handling or data output are present.",
  "flows": "Input source: method parameters (**kwargs) in paginate functions; flow to: base class paginate method, which would pass data to PageIterator. No untrusted data handling or external communication is performed within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward, focusing on type annotations and class inheritance for pagination. No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple paginator classes inheriting from a generic Paginator, with type annotations for request and response types. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, but no dynamic code execution, network operations, or credential handling. The presence of docstrings with documentation links is consistent with standard SDK stub code. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK stub for type annotations without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type annotations and class definitions for SDK pagination, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is purely for static type checking and documentation purposes. No external communication, credential handling, or suspicious logic is present.",
