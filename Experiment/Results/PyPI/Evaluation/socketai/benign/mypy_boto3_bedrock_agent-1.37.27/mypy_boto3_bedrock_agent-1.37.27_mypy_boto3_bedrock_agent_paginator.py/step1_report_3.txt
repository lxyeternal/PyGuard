{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator classes for the bedrock-agent service client in boto3, facilitating paginated API responses with type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class definitions for paginators with their paginate methods.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept arbitrary keyword arguments (**kwargs) which are unpacked into specific request types; no other external data sources or sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "The paginate methods receive input via **kwargs, which are unpacked into specific request type definitions; these are passed to the underlying paginator logic (not shown). There is no evidence of untrusted data flowing into sensitive sink functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward class definitions with type annotations, documentation links, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints and conditional import for Unpack is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a set of paginator classes for a boto3 client, with each class extending a base paginator and defining a paginate method. The methods accept **kwargs with specific types, ensuring type safety. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure is consistent, and the documentation links refer to official boto3 and boto3-stubs documentation. The import statements, class definitions, and methods all follow standard patterns without suspicious or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured set of paginator class definitions intended to enhance type safety for boto3 bedrock-agent client usage. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is evident.",
