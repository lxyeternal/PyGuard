{
  "purpose": "Define paginators for the 'bedrock-agent' service client, providing type annotations and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'sys', 'typing', 'botocore.paginate', and local type definitions; class method parameters with **kwargs; conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods accept **kwargs unpacked as type definitions, which are then used in method calls; no untrusted data sources or external data flows detected.",
  "flows": "Method calls to 'paginate' with unpacked **kwargs originating from method arguments; no external untrusted input sources or data leaks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is mainly boilerplate for paginator classes with documentation links and type annotations. No obfuscation, malicious code, or secret data handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of paginator classes for a boto3 service client, with type annotations, conditional imports for Python version compatibility, and documentation links. Each paginator class inherits from a base class, with a 'paginate' method that accepts unpacked request parameters typed with specific type definitions. The structure is consistent, and there are no signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or security issues. It appears to be generated boilerplate for API client pagination with safe, predictable behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign boilerplate implementation of paginator classes with type annotations and documentation links for a boto3 client. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. It is safe to use within the scope of SDK or API client code.",
