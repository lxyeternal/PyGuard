  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report notes that the code defines paginator classes with type annotations, inherits from a generic Paginator, and uses **kwargs with Unpack for flexible parameter passing. It states that no malicious behavior or suspicious patterns are observed.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard for boto3 stubs, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The use of **kwargs and Unpack aligns with typical SDK patterns. The report's conclusion that the code is benign and standard is accurate.\n\n- **Scores justification:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate. Risk score of 0.2 seems conservative but acceptable given the benign nature. Obfuscated score of 0 is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the boilerplate nature, type annotations, and safe structure. It notes no external data leaks or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is boilerplate for SDK stubs, with no malicious activity. The unpacking of **kwargs is standard and does not pose security risks.\n\n- **Scores justification:** Malware score 0 is correct. Risk score 0.1 is reasonable, reflecting very low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the standard structure, type safety, and documentation links. Finds no signs of malicious activity or backdoors.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no malicious patterns. It is typical SDK stub code for pagination.\n\n- **Scores justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate. Risk score 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code's role as a type annotation and pagination class definition, with no external communication or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely for static typing and documentation, with no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores justification:** Malware score 0. Risk score 0 is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing the code's function as a type-safe wrapper with no suspicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard for boto3 SDK stubs, with no malicious elements.\n\n- **Scores justification:** Malware score 0. Risk score 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is consistent with the code content. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n\n- **Risk score:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1-0.2, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to the use of **kwargs and Unpack, but these are standard patterns in SDK code)\n\n**Justification:** The code is a typical set of boto3 stub classes for pagination, with no malicious or suspicious patterns. The use of dynamic **kwargs unpacking is standard for such SDKs and does not introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and standard for SDK type stubs. No security concerns or malicious behavior detected.",
