  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Functionality Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It imports only `sys`, defines `print_info()` and `print_version()`, and executes `main()` which checks for `--version`.\n   - The logic is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are present.\n   - The output is static, and the input is limited to command-line arguments.\n\n2. **Evaluation of Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that the code is simple, static, and benign.\n   - They note the absence of suspicious behaviors, malicious code, obfuscation, or external dependencies.\n   - The reasoning is consistent and thorough, emphasizing the lack of any anomalies or security concerns.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero.\n\n3. **Scores Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity or code is detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct; code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 is justified; the script does not pose any security threat.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations:**\n   - No issues are present that would warrant a higher score.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n5. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The code is a standard informational CLI utility.\n   - No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are evident.\n   - The static URLs and version info are typical and not suspicious.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious activity or code detected.                                      |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                            |\n| Security Risk    | 0            | No security risks identified; code is benign and static.                   |\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no security concerns.\n- The reports are accurate and align with this assessment.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- I concur with the existing scores and assessments.\n- The code poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concern.",
