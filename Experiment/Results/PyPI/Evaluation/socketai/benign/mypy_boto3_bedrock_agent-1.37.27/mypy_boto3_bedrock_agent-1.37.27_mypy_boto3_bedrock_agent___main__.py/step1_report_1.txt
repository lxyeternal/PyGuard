  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. The code appears to be straightforward CLI utility with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines functions to print package info and version, and executes main() which checks for '--version' argument. If present, prints version; otherwise, prints info. No external data sources, no untrusted inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity. The code is simple and adheres to typical CLI patterns. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility that outputs package info and version details. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
