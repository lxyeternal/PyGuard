  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It imports only the standard `sys` module.\n   - It defines two functions: `print_info()` and `print_version()`, both writing static strings to `stdout`.\n   - The `main()` function checks for `--version` in `sys.argv` and calls the appropriate function.\n   - There are no external data sources, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or URLs that suggest malicious intent.\n   - The code is straightforward, clean, and adheres to common CLI patterns.\n\n2. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - They note the absence of suspicious patterns, external network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty in their assessments.\n   - The malware scores are all 0, consistent with the lack of malicious indicators.\n   - The security risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n3. **Scores Consistency and Justification:**\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - Given the simplicity and static nature of the code, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is correct, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n   - No issues or flaws are evident in the code or the reports.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as a benign CLI utility.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, safe CLI utility.\n   - The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, benign, and functions as intended without any security concerns. The reports correctly reflect this assessment.",
