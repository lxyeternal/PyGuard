  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the package version and documentation.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for output.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data to the console.",
  "flows": "User input in sys.argv triggers print_version, which flows to sys.stdout.write; otherwise, print_info is called, which also outputs to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code straightforwardly outputs static informational text.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a simple CLI utility that displays package info or version based on command-line input. It reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and writes static strings to stdout. No untrusted data sources, network access, or data leaks are present. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is well-structured, simple, and static.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a CLI informational script without malicious behavior or security risks.",
