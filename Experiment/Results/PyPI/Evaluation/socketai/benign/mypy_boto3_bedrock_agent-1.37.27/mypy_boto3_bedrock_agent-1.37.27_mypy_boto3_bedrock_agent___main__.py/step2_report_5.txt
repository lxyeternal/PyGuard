  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review and Issues Presence:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version.\n   - It reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) and writes to `sys.stdout`.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data sources.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - The code appears straightforward and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as a simple informational CLI utility.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The reasoning that the code is benign and has no security risks is sound.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - No evidence of malicious intent or behavior warrants higher risk scores.\n   - The code is static, with no external dependencies or dynamic features that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or behaviors.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on static analysis.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Additional Justification:**\nGiven the simplicity and static nature of the code, there's no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code performs only basic CLI output functions with no external dependencies or dynamic behavior.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
