  "purpose": "A minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for outputting static strings",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) to output functions (print_info or print_version)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI script that outputs static package info or version based on command-line input. It imports only 'sys', defines two functions for printing info and version, and executes 'main()' which checks for '--version'. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data processing is present. The code is clear, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static CLI utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It performs straightforward output based on command-line input, with no security concerns or suspicious behaviors detected.",
