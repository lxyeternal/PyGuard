  "purpose": "CLI entry point for displaying package information and version details",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for displaying information",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check in main() → print_version() or print_info() → stdout output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious URLs; no unusual code patterns; no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic CLI functions: displaying package info and version based on arguments. It imports sys and defines functions for printing static information. There are no external data inputs besides command-line args, and no data is transmitted or processed insecurely. No malicious behavior, code injection, or backdoors are present. The URLs and version info are static and do not point to malicious sites. The structure is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility for informational display with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
