  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Outputs information to stdout using sys.stdout.write().",
  "flows": "Command-line input (argument '--version') triggers print_version() which writes version info to stdout; otherwise, print_info() is called, which writes package info to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code, and no external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The script simply provides CLI functionality to display package info or version. It reads command-line arguments and writes static information to stdout. There are no inputs from untrusted sources beyond command-line arguments, and outputs are static. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present.",
