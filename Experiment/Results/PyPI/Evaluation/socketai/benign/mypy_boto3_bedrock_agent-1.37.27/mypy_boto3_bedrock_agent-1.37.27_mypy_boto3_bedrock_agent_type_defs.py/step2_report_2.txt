  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports clearly state that the code consists solely of type annotations, data models, and schema definitions.\n   - No runtime logic, network activity, file operations, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code is standard for SDKs or API schema definitions, with conditional imports for compatibility.\n\n2. **Potential Security Risks:**\n   - The code is purely declarative; it does not execute any side effects or handle untrusted data at runtime.\n   - The only external modules imported are `sys`, `datetime`, `typing`, and `botocore.response`, which are standard and do not pose security concerns within this context.\n   - There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms.\n\n3. **Scores Justification:**\n   - The malware score in all reports is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with no obfuscation detected.\n   - The security risk score is 0, since the code does not perform any operations that could compromise security.\n   - The confidence levels are 1.0, indicating high certainty in the analysis.\n\n4. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they recognize the code as static schema definitions with no malicious intent.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly states the nature of the code.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations and data models for the `bedrock-agent` SDK.\n   - It is designed for static type checking, documentation, and validation, not for runtime logic or data handling.\n   - No security concerns or malicious activity are evident.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- The current scores are appropriate:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Risk: 0\n\n- Given the high confidence and the nature of the code, I concur with the assessments.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe schema definition module with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
