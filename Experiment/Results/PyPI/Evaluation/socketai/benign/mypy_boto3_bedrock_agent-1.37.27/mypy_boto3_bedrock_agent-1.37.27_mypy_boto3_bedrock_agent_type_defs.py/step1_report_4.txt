{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for bedrock-agent service types in a Python SDK, primarily for data validation and documentation.",
  "sources": "Constant imports, type annotations, and class definitions; no external data inputs or data reading operations observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external data outputs, or untrusted data handling identified; no network, file, or environment variable access present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows, data processing, or execution paths involving untrusted input or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated logic, or suspicious code constructs; standard use of type hints, TypedDict, and unions. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of type annotations, class definitions, and data structures for SDK documentation purposes. It leverages Python typing and TypedDict to define schemas and data models, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. There are no runtime operations, external input/output, or dynamic code execution. All components are straightforward, standard, and intended for static validation and documentation, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for type definition and data validation within an SDK; no malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are present. It is a standard, well-structured schema definition module without external or unsafe operations.",
