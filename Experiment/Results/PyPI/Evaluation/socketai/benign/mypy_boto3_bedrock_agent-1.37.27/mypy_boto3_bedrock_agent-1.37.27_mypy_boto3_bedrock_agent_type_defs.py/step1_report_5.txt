{
  "purpose": "The code provides detailed type annotations and data structure definitions for the bedrock-agent service API, facilitating type safety and clarity in data handling within a Python SDK or client.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules (sys, datetime, typing, botocore), and defines various TypedDict, Union, and class structures for data handling.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present. The code primarily defines data types and structures without executing side-effect causing operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data; the code only sets up type annotations and data schemas without executing any data flow or operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard type annotation and data schema definitions. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is present. The structure and naming are consistent with SDK or API client definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining type annotations, TypedDicts, and data structures for a Python SDK related to bedrock-agent services. It imports standard and external typing modules conditionally based on Python version but does not execute any logic or include external calls that could be malicious. No indications of malware, code injection, or sabotage mechanisms are present. The absence of any system or network operation, malicious payload, or obfuscation supports this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of type definitions and data schemas for a Python API SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It is solely intended for type safety and data validation within the SDK context.",
