  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Obfuscation:**  \n   All reports explicitly state that the code consists solely of static type annotations, data schemas, and class definitions. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious payloads. The code does not perform any runtime operations, network activity, or file I/O beyond type hints and data models.\n\n2. **Potential Security Risks:**  \n   The code is purely declarative, serving as type definitions for a Python SDK or API client. It imports standard modules (`sys`, `datetime`, `typing`) and a third-party module (`botocore.response`) but only for type annotations and conditional imports based on Python version. No secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are hardcoded.\n\n3. **Suspicious Patterns or Anomalies:**  \n   No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious constructs are identified. The extensive use of `TypedDict`, `Union`, and conditional imports is standard for SDK schema definitions.\n\n4. **Data Flow and External Interaction:**  \n   The code does not contain any runtime logic, control flow, or data handling that involves untrusted data or external systems. It is a static schema definition module.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**  \n   Based on the detailed analysis and the explicit statements in the reports, **there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks** in this code. It is a well-structured, standard set of type annotations and data models for an SDK.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Scores:**\n\n| Aspect                  | Reported Score | Justification / Recommended Score                                              |\n|-------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware                 | 0              | No malicious code or payload detected.                                         |\n| Obfuscated              | 0                | No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.                                    |\n| Risk (security risk)    | 0                | No active code, secrets, or external interactions.                            |\n\n**All reports are consistent with the assessment that this code is purely declarative, safe, and standard.**\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n- **Risk Score:** **0**  \n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the detailed analysis. The code is safe, standard, and intended solely for static type validation and documentation within an SDK.\n\n**Work through this carefully, but all evidence points to a benign, non-malicious code base.**",
