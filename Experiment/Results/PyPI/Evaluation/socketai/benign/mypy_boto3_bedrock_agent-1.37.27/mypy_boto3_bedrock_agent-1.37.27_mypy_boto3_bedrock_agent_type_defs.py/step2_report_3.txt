  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports indicate that the code consists solely of static type annotations, data models, and schema definitions.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, or side effects are present.\n- No external data handling, network activity, file I/O, or command execution is detected.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, secrets, or backdoors.\n- The code appears to be a well-structured SDK schema module for the bedrock-agent service.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- The code imports standard modules (`sys`, `datetime`, `typing`) and third-party modules (`botocore.response`) but only uses them for type annotations.\n- Conditional imports based on Python version are standard practice.\n- No dynamic code execution, network connections, or data leaks are evident.\n- The purpose is purely declarative: defining data schemas, request/response types, and configuration models.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks are identified.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of any malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, aligning with the straightforward, declarative nature of the code.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports give a risk score of 0, which is justified given the purely static, schema-defining purpose.\n\n**Any Discrepancies or Concerns?**\n- None. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a static, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security threats are present.\n- The detailed type annotations serve documentation and validation purposes only.\n\n**My Expert Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, standard, and appropriate for its intended purpose. No further security concerns are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and thorough.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The code is benign and security-neutral.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or have additional reports to review.",
