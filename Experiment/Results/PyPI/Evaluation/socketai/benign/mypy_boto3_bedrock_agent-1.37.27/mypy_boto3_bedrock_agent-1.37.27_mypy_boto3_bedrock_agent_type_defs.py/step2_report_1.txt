  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, considering the provided code and the context of supply chain security.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is purely declarative, consisting of type annotations, data schemas, and class definitions.\n- No runtime logic, network operations, file I/O, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, secrets, or backdoors are identified.\n- The code appears to be a standard SDK schema definition for the bedrock-agent service.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious Code or Anomalies:**\n- The code is a set of `TypedDict`, `Union`, and conditional imports based on Python version.\n- No runtime code, command execution, or external data handling is present.\n- No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n**2. External Inputs or Data Handling:**\n- Imports are from standard modules (`sys`, `datetime`, `typing`, `botocore.response`) and local literals.\n- No untrusted data sources or external command executions.\n\n**3. Data Flow and Sinks:**\n- All data structures are static definitions.\n- No data is read from or written to external systems within this code snippet.\n\n**4. Signatures of Security Risks:**\n- No dynamic code execution, code injection, or network activity.\n- No embedded secrets or credentials.\n- The code is purely declarative.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification:\n\n**Malware Score: 0**\n- No malicious code, payloads, or backdoors detected.\n- No obfuscated code or dynamic execution.\n\n**Obfuscated Score: 0**\n- The code is straightforward, with clear type annotations.\n- No obfuscation patterns or unusual constructs.\n\n**Risk Score: 0**\n- The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks.\n- It is a static schema definition, safe by design.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review of the Reports:\n\n- The reports are consistent in their conclusions, emphasizing the absence of malicious activity.\n- They correctly identify that the code is purely for type annotations and data models.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on static code inspection.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for an SDK.\n- No dynamic or runtime logic, network calls, or external data handling.\n- No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis supply chain component is a benign, purely declarative module for type safety and documentation purposes. It poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, standard, and free from malware or obfuscation. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis or a different focus is required.",
