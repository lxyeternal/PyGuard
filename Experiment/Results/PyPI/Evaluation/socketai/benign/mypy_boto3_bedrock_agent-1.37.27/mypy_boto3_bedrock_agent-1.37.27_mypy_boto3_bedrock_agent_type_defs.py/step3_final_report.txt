{
  "purpose": "The code defines static type annotations, data schemas, and class definitions for the bedrock-agent SDK, serving as documentation and validation schemas without runtime logic.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard modules (sys, datetime, typing), third-party (botocore.response), and local literals; no external data inputs or runtime data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; the code is purely declarative with no data sinks, external writes, or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows or runtime data handling; all structures are static type definitions and data models.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, secrets, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward schema definitions.",
  "analysis": "Static analysis shows the code comprises only TypedDicts, Union types, and conditional imports for compatibility. No runtime logic, network activity, or external data handling exists. The code is standard for SDK schema definitions, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. All signals indicate a benign, purely declarative module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard set of type definitions and data schemas for the SDK, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. It poses no threat in supply chain context.",
