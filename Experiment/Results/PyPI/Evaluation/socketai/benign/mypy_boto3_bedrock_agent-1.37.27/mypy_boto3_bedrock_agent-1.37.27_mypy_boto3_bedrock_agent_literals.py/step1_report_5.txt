{
  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for various AWS service and resource identifiers used in the bedrock-agent service and related documentation.",
  "sources": "Literal type definitions assigned to variables such as ActionGroupSignatureType, AgentStatusType, ServiceName, etc.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code consists of static type definitions with no data flow or dynamic execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present. The license and documentation comments are benign.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'sys' to determine Python version and conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It then defines numerous Literal type aliases representing AWS services, resource types, statuses, and other enumerations. All definitions are static and solely serve as type annotations for external use. There are no functions, data processing, or runtime behaviors that could be malicious. The content appears to be auto-generated or maintained for type safety, with no evidence of malicious or sabotage code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely a collection of static type aliases for AWS service and resource identifiers, serving documentation and type checking purposes. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present. The code is safe and intended for type annotations.",
