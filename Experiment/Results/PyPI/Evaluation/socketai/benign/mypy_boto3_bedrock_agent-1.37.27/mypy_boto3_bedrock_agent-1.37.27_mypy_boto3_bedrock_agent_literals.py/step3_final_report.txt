{
  "purpose": "Defines static string literal types for type safety and documentation in the 'bedrock-agent' service.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to type aliases; no runtime input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external output handling.",
  "flows": "None; purely static definitions with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward static type declarations. The copyright year 2025 appears to be a placeholder or typo, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then declares multiple type aliases as string literals. There is no dynamic code, network activity, secrets, or obfuscation. It serves solely as a static type annotation module for improved type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static module providing string literal type aliases. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
