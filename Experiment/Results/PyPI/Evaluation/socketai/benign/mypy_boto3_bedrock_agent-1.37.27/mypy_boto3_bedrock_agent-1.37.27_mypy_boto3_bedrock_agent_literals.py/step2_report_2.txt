  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any discrepancies, potential issues, or inconsistencies.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes static type definitions for the 'bedrock-agent' service, based on string literals.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** The report correctly notes that the code is static, with no dynamic behavior or external data handling. The mention of a future-dated copyright (2025) is benign.\n- **Malware & Risk:** No signs of malicious activity; the code is purely static type declarations.\n- **Score Justification:** The malware score of 0.0 is appropriate; the risk score of 0.0 is justified given the benign nature.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on type safety via string literals.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** The code is static, with no dynamic or external operations. The use of conditional import for 'Literal' is standard.\n- **Malware & Risk:** No malicious indicators. The code's sole purpose is to define constants for type annotations.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0.0 and risk score of 0.0 are appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, static type annotations for enumerations and constants.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code. The code is straightforward.\n- **Malware & Risk:** No malware; the risk remains negligible.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0.0 and risk score of 0.0 are justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static definitions for type safety.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No dynamic code, input handling, or suspicious patterns. The code is a typical static type declaration module.\n- **Malware & Risk:** No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0.0, risk score of 0.0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for AWS services and resource identifiers.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** The code is static, with no runtime or external data handling. No secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Risk:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware score of 0.0; risk score of 0.0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe static, straightforward type alias definitions using string literals for AWS services and internal SDK components.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent in any report.\n- **Risk Assessment:** The code is purely declarative, used for type safety and documentation, with no runtime or external data handling.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0, as no obfuscation or suspicious code is present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0, since the code does not perform any operations, handle secrets, or communicate externally.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign static type declaration module, typical in Python projects for enhancing type safety. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \nNo changes needed; the scores are consistent with the code's nature.",
