  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports describe the code as static type alias declarations using string literals, with no dynamic or runtime behavior. The code is purely declarative, defining constants for type safety and documentation purposes. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data processing, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Logic or Reasoning**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is a static module for type annotations, with conditional imports for compatibility. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0.0, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code. The obfuscated score is also 0, as there's no obfuscation. The security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign description.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports conclude that the code is purely static, benign, and contains no malicious behavior, raising the risk or malware scores above 0.5 would be unjustified. The evidence supports a malware score of 0, and a security risk score of 0.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as static type declarations with no malicious intent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report Content**:  \n   The scores are consistent. All reports assign zero to malware and security risk, which matches the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0.0 — no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0 — straightforward static declarations.\n- **Risk Score**: 0.0 — no security risks identified.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard static type declaration module, common in Python projects to enhance type safety. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0.0  \n- **Risk**: 0.0  \n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
