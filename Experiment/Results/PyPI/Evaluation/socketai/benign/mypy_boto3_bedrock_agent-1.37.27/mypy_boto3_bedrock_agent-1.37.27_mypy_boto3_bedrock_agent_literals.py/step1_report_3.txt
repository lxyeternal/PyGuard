{
  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for various enumerations and string constants related to the bedrock-agent service and AWS resource identifiers.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing (for conditional import of Literal), and the definitions of string literal types throughout the module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; the code only defines constants and type annotations without runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only establishes type aliases and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present. The code solely consists of static type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, then defines multiple string literal types as type aliases for enumerations used in AWS or service-specific contexts. No runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling exists. The purpose appears to be static type annotations for a SDK or codebase. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The definitions are straightforward and serve documentation and type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static module providing type annotations and string constants for better type safety and documentation. There are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security risks present.",
