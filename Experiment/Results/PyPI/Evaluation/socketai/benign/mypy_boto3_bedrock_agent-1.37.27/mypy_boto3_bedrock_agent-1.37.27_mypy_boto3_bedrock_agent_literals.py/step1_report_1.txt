{
  "purpose": "Defines type literals for various categories used in the 'bedrock-agent' service, primarily for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from string literals assigned to type aliases, especially in the 'Literal' definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only declares constants for type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a copyright statement indicating 2025, which is future-dated, but this is not malicious; the code appears to be a straightforward static type declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'Literal' based on Python version and defines multiple type aliases using 'Literal'. No dynamic code execution, no network communication, no secret handling, and no obfuscated or suspicious logic. All definitions are static string constants used for type annotations, which are common in Python for static type checking. There are no functions, input/output handling, or runtime behaviors that could be exploited or that indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely a set of static type alias declarations using string literals, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical pattern for type safety in Python projects.",
