{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for use in type annotations related to the bedrock-agent service and various AWS services, facilitating type safety and clarity in the SDK or application.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module to check Python version; static assignment of string literals for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or data flows to sinks are present; the code solely defines constants.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow or source-to-sink operations; the code consists of static type literal definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code strictly contains type annotations and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a docstring describing its purpose, then conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version. It then defines numerous type aliases as string literals for various service-related types. All definitions are static, straightforward, and lack any form of data manipulation or external calls. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The code functions solely as a type definition module, with no code that could execute malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type annotations defining string literal types for AWS and service-specific constants, intended to improve type safety. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It is a benign, purely declarative module with no security risks.",
