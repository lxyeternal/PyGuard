  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various string literals used in the bedrock-agent service, facilitating type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Literal type definitions for string constants, imported 'sys' module for version check.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; purely static type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or input/output operations; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and solely declares string literal types; no dynamic code, input handling, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a descriptive comment and imports the 'sys' module. It conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is a standard compatibility pattern. It then declares a large number of string literal types as type aliases, all of which are static string constants. The '__all__' list explicitly exports these type aliases, which is common in public API modules. There are no functions, no data processing, no input/output operations, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a static, type-definition module intended for type hinting support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign type annotation module defining string literal types for static type checking. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. It is a straightforward, static declaration file with no potential for malicious activity.",
