  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - No input/output, external data fetching, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code is standard metadata used in Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign.\n   - The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or oversight but not malicious.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, which is correct.\n   - Confidence scores are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about benignity.\n   - The third report assigns a slightly lower confidence (0.9) due to the future year, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any malicious activity or vulnerabilities that would warrant a higher risk score.\n   - The code is static, simple, and contains no external dependencies or suspicious logic.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, which is justified.\n   - No malicious intent or behavior is detected.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on code analysis, which is appropriate.\n   - The only \"anomaly\" (future year) is not treated as malicious, which is correct.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — The code is purely metadata with no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard version declaration with no security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are justified and should remain as is.",
