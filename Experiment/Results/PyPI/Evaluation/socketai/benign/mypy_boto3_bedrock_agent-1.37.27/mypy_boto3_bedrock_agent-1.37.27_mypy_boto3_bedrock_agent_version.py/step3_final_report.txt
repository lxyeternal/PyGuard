  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string for version control and metadata.",
  "sources": "No external sources; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to __version__, with a comment. No dynamic code, input/output, external data fetching, or obfuscation is present. The only anomaly is the future year (2025), likely a typo or oversight, but it does not introduce security risks or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The anomaly does not affect the security assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as version metadata. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. The only minor point is the future copyright year, which is not a security concern.",
