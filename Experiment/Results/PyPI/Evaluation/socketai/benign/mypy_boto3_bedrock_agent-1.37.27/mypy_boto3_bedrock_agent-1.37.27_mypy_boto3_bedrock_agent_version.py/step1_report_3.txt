  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the version string to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright notice with a future year (2025) which is inconsistent or possibly a typo, but not malicious. No suspicious code behavior or hidden functionality detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to the __version__ variable and includes a copyright comment. There are no functions, external data reads, network calls, or obfuscated constructs. The license comment does not influence execution. The version number appears normal, but the copyright year is set in the future, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, serving to specify package version information. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The only notable anomaly is the future copyright year, likely a typo or oversight, not malicious.",
