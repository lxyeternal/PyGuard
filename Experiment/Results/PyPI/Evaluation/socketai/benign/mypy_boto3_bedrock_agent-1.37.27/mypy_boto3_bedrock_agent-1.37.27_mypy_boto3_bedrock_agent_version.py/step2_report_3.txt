  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the code in question.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, static assignment of a version string to the `__version__` variable, accompanied by a copyright comment. There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic behaviors, or suspicious constructs. The code is standard practice in Python packages for version metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues present?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and contains only a variable assignment.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  The reports correctly identify the simplicity and benign nature of the code. The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a typo or oversight but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed analysis of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1 & 2:\n- **Assessment:**  \n  Both accurately describe the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reasoning is sound.\n\n- **Score justification:**  \n  Malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and security risk is 0, consistent with the code.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Assessment:**  \n  Notes the future copyright year (2025).  \n  This is an anomaly but not malicious. The reasoning is accurate.\n\n- **Score justification:**  \n  The confidence is slightly below 1 (0.9), which is reasonable given the minor anomaly. No change needed.\n\n#### Reports 4 & 5:\n- **Assessment:**  \n  Both confirm the code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Score justification:**  \n  Malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are appropriately set to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports agree on 0, and the code contains no malicious behavior.  \n  **My estimate:** 0\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  No obfuscation present.  \n  **My estimate:** 0\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Since the code is purely metadata with no security implications, a score of 0 is appropriate.  \n  **My estimate:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The only notable point is the future year (2025) in the copyright comment, which could be a typo.  \n- No dynamic code, external data, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type     | My Estimated Score |\n|----------------|---------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                  |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                  |\n| Security Risk  | 0                  |\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no security concerns or malicious intent.**",
