{
  "purpose": "Defines mappings for Elasticsearch aggregate objects and their arguments, used internally for querying and aggregation operations.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (`six`, internal modules), and the AGGREGATES dictionary which contains the aggregate definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data is output or sent over the network within this code.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets static definitions and class structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed; the code is straightforward, defining static mappings and a class.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a dictionary of aggregation types with their expected arguments, and a class that uses this dictionary. No dynamic execution, external input handling, or network activity is present. The use of `six` for compatibility and class inheritance appears standard. The code is purely definitional, intended for internal use within a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign part of an Elasticsearch client or internal querying library. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. It simply maps aggregation names to their argument structures and defines an aggregate class for internal logic.",
