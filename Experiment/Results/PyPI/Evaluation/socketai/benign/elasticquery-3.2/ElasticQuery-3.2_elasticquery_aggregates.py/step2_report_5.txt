  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a static configuration module defining Elasticsearch aggregation types and their arguments.\n- It imports 'six' for compatibility, uses internal modules, and defines a class that extends a base class.\n- There are no user inputs, network operations, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns.\n- The purpose is internal configuration, not data processing or external communication.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as static configuration for internal use.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Justification:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly notes the code defines aggregate types with arguments, with no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Justification:** The slight security risk score (0.1) is probably conservative, as the code doesn't interact with external data or execute code dynamically.\n- **Recommendation:** Given the benign nature, the security risk score could be lowered to 0, unless the scoring schema mandates some minimal risk for static configs.\n\n**Suggested change:** Reduce `securityRisk` from 0.1 to **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to above, straightforward static definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Justification:** Fully aligned with the code's benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states the code is static configuration, with no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the code.\n\n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as others; static configuration, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Justification:** Slightly less confident, but still accurate.\n\n**No change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Recommendations**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign static configuration.\n- The malware score is appropriately zero across all reports.\n- The security risk score is mostly zero, except for Report 2, which assigns 0.1.\n\n**Given the code's nature, I recommend:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected).\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present).\n- **Security risk score:** **0** (no security risk, as it's static configuration).\n\n---\n\n### **Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0** |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis, confirming the code is safe, benign, and standard for internal configuration.",
