  "purpose": "Static configuration defining Elasticsearch aggregation mappings and their arguments for internal use.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; static dictionary AGGREGATES and class definition.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data structures only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module that maps aggregation types to their argument specifications, utilizing standard Python constructs and the 'six' library for compatibility. It defines a dictionary AGGREGATES with various aggregation types and their parameters, and a class Aggregate that extends BaseAggregate with this configuration. There are no runtime data inputs, external network interactions, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns. The code serves as internal configuration data, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module for Elasticsearch aggregations. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0, all consistent with its purpose and structure.",
