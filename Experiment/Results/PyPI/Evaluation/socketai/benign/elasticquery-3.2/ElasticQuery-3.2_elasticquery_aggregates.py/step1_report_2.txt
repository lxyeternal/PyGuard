  "purpose": "Define and configure various Elasticsearch aggregate types and their arguments for use within the ElasticQuery library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'six', and internal module imports (.dsl, .exceptions). The entire file content itself.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external output; mainly definitions and class setup.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code mainly sets up static configuration and class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is a standard setup for aggregate definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary of Elasticsearch aggregate types with their expected arguments, used for dynamic aggregation building. It imports necessary modules and sets up a class with metadata and error handling. No external data handling, user input, or insecure operations are present. The structure appears standard for a library module. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, non-malicious setup for defining Elasticsearch aggregations within a Python library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code is clear, well-structured, and intended for internal use.",
