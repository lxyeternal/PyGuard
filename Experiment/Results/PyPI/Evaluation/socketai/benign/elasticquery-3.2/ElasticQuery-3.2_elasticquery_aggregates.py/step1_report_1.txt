{
  "purpose": "Define and configure Elasticsearch aggregation mappings for internal use within the ElasticQuery library.",
  "sources": "Import statements, dictionary definitions, class declaration, and class attributes",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data processing or external output occurs within this code",
  "flows": "N/A — static configuration without runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a dictionary 'AGGREGATES' detailing Elasticsearch aggregation options and a class 'Aggregate' extending 'BaseAggregate' with specific configurations. No user input handling, external network operations, or code that could lead to data leakage or system compromise is present. The use of 'six' for compatibility is standard, and no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected. The structure is straightforward, static, and consistent with typical library configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration module for Elasticsearch aggregations, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured code for defining mappings and class inheritance without external interactions.",
