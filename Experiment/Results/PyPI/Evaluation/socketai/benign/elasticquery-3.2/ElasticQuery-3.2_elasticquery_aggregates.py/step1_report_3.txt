  "purpose": "Define and manage Elasticsearch aggregation configurations and mappings within a Python library.",
  "sources": "Imported modules (.dsl, .exceptions), internal AGGREGATES dictionary, class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed; code mainly defines static configurations.",
  "flows": "Static data in AGGREGATES used to configure aggregation behaviors, with no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, such as obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. The code appears standard and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a set of aggregation configurations for Elasticsearch, including metric, bucket, and pipeline aggregations, stored in a dictionary. It uses a metaclass-based class Aggregate that inherits from BaseAggregate, with no input/output operations or external data processing. No hardcoded secrets, malicious functions, or potentially harmful code patterns are present. The code's purpose is configuration management, not execution of untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, configuration-focused module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is safe for use and appears to be part of an Elasticsearch client library.",
