{
  "purpose": "Define a set of Elasticsearch aggregation types and their argument specifications for internal use within an ElasticQuery library.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external modules and internal package components, the AGGREGATES dictionary containing aggregation definitions, and the Aggregate class definition.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code mainly defines static data and a class structure. No untrusted data processing or external communication is evident.",
  "flows": "The code initializes static aggregation configurations and defines a class that inherits from BaseAggregate, with no dynamic data flow or external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward static definitions with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. No unusual code patterns or anomalies are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a dictionary of Elasticsearch aggregation configurations with specific arguments. These configurations seem to be static and intended for internal validation or configuration within the library. The Aggregate class is a standard class definition extending BaseAggregate, utilizing the AGGREGATES definitions and associated with an exception class for errors. There is no evidence of data processing, user input handling, external communications, or other typical vectors for malicious activity. The overall structure suggests a configuration or model class with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for Elasticsearch aggregations within a Python library. It contains no malicious or suspicious code and serves as static data definitions. No security risks or malware behavior are identified.",
