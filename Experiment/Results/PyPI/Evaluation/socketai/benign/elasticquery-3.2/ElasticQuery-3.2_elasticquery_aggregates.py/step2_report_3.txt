  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines static mappings for Elasticsearch aggregations, with no runtime data flow, external inputs, or outputs. No malicious patterns or obfuscation detected.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, configuration-only, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate. Confidence: 1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes static definitions, no external data handling, and standard structure.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code, no obfuscation. The code is purely definitional.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.1 — slightly above zero, but given the benign nature, perhaps a minimal security risk score could be justified if considering potential misconfiguration, but no evidence supports actual risk.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep securityRisk at 0 or very close to zero; no change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates static configuration, no external data flow, no malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, just static mappings.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, static definitions, no external interactions.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity or malicious intent detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Static configuration for Elasticsearch aggregations, no data flow or external interaction.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static configuration nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate for all reports.\n\n### My Overall Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments needed. The code is a benign configuration module for Elasticsearch aggregations, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
