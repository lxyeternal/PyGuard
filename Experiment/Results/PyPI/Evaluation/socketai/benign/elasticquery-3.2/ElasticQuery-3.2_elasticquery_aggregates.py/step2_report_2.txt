  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is purely static configuration for Elasticsearch aggregations. No dynamic data, no external input, no network activity, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified, as no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it describes static definitions for Elasticsearch aggregations, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — slightly above zero, perhaps considering minimal configuration risk, but still negligible.\n- **Comments:** Slightly higher than Report 1, but still very low risk.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; static definitions, no external or dynamic behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Comments:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports; static mappings, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Well-founded.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; static configuration, no external interactions.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very close to zero.\n- **Comments:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is static configuration data for Elasticsearch aggregation mappings.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malicious code, dynamic execution, or external data handling.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n- The risk scores are mostly 0, with a minor 0.1 in one report, which is reasonable given the static nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no vulnerabilities or security risks present.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is purely definitional and intended for internal library use.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security flaws.\n- The use of `six` for compatibility is standard.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign, static configuration module for Elasticsearch aggregations with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- No changes needed; the reports are accurate.",
