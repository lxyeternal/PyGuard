{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a library, containing static metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "The script reads static metadata fields such as version, name, description, author, email, URL, package directory, packages list, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or external data sinks; the script does not process untrusted input or perform network or file operations.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static metadata definitions to the call to setup(), with no dynamic or external data processing involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, static, and follows typical packaging conventions with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script is a conventional setup.py file that imports setuptools and calls setup() with hardcoded parameters. It contains no dynamic code, untrusted input, or suspicious behavior. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate it poses no security risks. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the current scoring reflects the safe nature of the code. No modifications or further actions are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
