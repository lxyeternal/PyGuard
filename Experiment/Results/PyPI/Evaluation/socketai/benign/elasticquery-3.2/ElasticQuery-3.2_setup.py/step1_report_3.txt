  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and adheres to typical setup script conventions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools. It defines package metadata and dependencies with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. There are no input sources or untrusted data handling, and no sinks or flows that could lead to security issues. The script's simplicity and lack of external data manipulation suggest it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script appears to be a standard package configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors. Overall, it is safe and benign.",
