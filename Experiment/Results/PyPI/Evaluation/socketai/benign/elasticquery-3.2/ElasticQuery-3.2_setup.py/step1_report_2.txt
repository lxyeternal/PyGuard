  "purpose": "This setup.py script is used for packaging and distributing the ElasticQuery Python module, specifying its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'install_requires' list for dependencies; no external data sources or user inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no untrusted data flows or outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script solely defines package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a setup script, with no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and calls the setup() function with package metadata such as version, name, description, author info, URL, package directories, and dependencies. All elements are typical for a Python package setup file. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior. The dependencies listed are common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py is a straightforward package configuration file with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines how to package and distribute the ElasticQuery module.",
