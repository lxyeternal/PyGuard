{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script is used to define the installation configuration for the ElasticQuery Python package, specifying metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as package metadata (version, name, description, author info, URL, dependencies). No external or untrusted data input is read.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any dynamic or untrusted data sinks. It solely calls the setup() function with predefined parameters.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The script executes a standard setup procedure with hardcoded parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The script appears straightforward and contains no obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious instructions are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the setuptools library and calls the setup() function with static, hardcoded metadata about the package. There are no dynamic data reads, network calls, or untrusted input handling. The code serves a conventional purpose for package setup. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The code is minimal and standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines the package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
