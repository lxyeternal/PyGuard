  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from standard Python error classes. There are no data inputs, external calls, or executable logic. Therefore, **no issues are present** in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no malicious or suspicious constructs. No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, appropriate since the code is straightforward.  \n   - **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security risk score:** 0, as there's no security concern.  \n   \n   These scores seem reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is purely class definitions with no runtime behavior, there's no basis for assigning a higher risk score. All reports agree on this, and I concur.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any malicious activity—no code injection, obfuscation, or data exfiltration. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They recognize that the code is benign and part of a larger project.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the reports:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed reasoning provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the thorough reviews, I agree with the assigned scores. The code is harmless, standard, and serves as a part of an error handling framework.\n\n**Therefore, I conclude:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code snippet poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
