  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from standard Python exceptions. There are no data processing, external interactions, or executable logic. Therefore, **no issues are present** in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no malicious or suspicious constructs. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code clarity.  \n   - **Malware**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security Risk**: All reports assign 0, which is correct for such simple class definitions.  \n   \n   The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports conclude that the code is harmless, and there's no evidence of malicious intent, **risk scores should remain at 0**. Assigning higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's static structure, confirming that there are no hidden malicious behaviors.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis, all indicating no security issues or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0**  \n- **Risk Score**: **0**\n\n**Rationale**:  \nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and align with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**:  \nThis supply chain security incident involves only benign, structural code with no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.",
