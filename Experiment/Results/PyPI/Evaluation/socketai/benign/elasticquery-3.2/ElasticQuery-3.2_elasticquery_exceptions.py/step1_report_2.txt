  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Elasticsearch query building errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for custom exceptions; no external data input or reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurring; solely class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from standard Python exceptions. There are no functions, no data input/output operations, no network calls, or other behaviors that could be malicious. The classes are straightforward custom exceptions for specific error types related to Elasticsearch query building. No hardcoded credentials, no code injection points, and no obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
