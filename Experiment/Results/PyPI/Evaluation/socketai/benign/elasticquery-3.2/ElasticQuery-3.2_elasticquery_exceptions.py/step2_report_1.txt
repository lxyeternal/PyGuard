  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Elasticsearch query building.\n   - No functions, data processing, external data handling, or malicious logic are present.\n   - The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a larger codebase.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or security issues are identified in the code snippets.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, and the code is purely exception class definitions, this is appropriate.\n   - No risk scores need to be increased.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious actions or contain obfuscated/malicious logic.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward inspection.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is purely based on the code provided.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:** The code is benign, and the security posture is excellent in this context.",
