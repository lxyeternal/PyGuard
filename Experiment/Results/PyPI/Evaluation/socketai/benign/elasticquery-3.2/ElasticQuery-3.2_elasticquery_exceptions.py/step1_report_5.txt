  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Elasticsearch query builder errors.",
  "sources": "No external input, data, or environment variables are read; only class definitions are present.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or output occurs that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines exception classes with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, inheriting from built-in error types. There are no data inputs, external calls, or suspicious behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual constructs are present. The structure and content are typical for custom exception classes in Python.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of custom exception class definitions for an Elasticsearch query builder module. It poses no security risk or malicious intent.",
