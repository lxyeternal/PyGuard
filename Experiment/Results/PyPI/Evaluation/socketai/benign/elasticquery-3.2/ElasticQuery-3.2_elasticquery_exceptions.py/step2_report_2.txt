  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - The code is straightforward and serves as part of an error handling framework.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n\n3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - No evidence suggests any security concern.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports assign malware score 0, which is correct.\n   - The code contains no malicious logic.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to factual analysis.\n   - They correctly interpret the code's purpose and nature.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is purely class definitions for custom exceptions.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores assigned (all zeros for malware, obfuscated, and security risk) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is harmless, standard, and poses no security concerns. No adjustments are necessary.",
