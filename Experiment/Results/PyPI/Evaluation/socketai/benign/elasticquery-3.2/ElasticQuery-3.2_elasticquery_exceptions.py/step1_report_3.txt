  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for an Elasticsearch query builder module",
  "sources": "No data input sources; class definitions are static and do not read external input",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class inheritance and simple class definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists of straightforward class declarations with no unusual features",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes inheriting from built-in Python exceptions. There are no data inputs, external calls, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or malicious constructs are present. The code's structure is simple and standard for defining custom exceptions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of exception class definitions for an Elasticsearch query builder and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
