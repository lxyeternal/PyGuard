{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for Elasticsearch query builder errors",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading points; only class definitions",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; purely class declarations",
  "flows": "No data flow as there are no executable statements or data processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from standard exceptions",
  "analysis": "The code only declares several custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions like ValueError and QueryError. There is no input handling, data processing, or dynamic code execution. It appears to serve as part of an error handling framework within a larger Elasticsearch query builder module. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present; no code injection, obfuscation, or data exfiltration mechanisms are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and solely defines custom exception classes for handling specific Elasticsearch query errors. It presents no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
