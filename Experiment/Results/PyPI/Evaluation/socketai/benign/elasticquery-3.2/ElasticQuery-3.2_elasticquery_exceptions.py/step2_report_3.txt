  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external interactions, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly conclude that the code is harmless and standard for defining custom exceptions.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated: 0`\n     - `malware: 0`\n     - `securityRisk: 0`\n     - `confidence: 1`\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign zero risk scores, and the code is benign, there's no justification for higher scores.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Malware Score Analysis:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious logic or behaviors.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They recognize the code as simple class definitions with no security implications.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, harmless set of custom exception class definitions. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. The reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.",
