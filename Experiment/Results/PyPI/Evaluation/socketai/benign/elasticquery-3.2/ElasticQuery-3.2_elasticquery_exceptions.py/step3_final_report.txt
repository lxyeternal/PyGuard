  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Elasticsearch query building errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard Python error classes; no external data input or dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or processing logic exists.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions with no functions, data processing, or external calls. It is clear, simple, and standard for error handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code does not perform any runtime actions or data leaks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security risk or malicious threat. It is purely structural with no suspicious elements.",
