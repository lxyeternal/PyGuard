  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling errors in an Elasticsearch query builder module.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading mechanisms present; only class definitions for exception handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external system interaction present; only exception class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow involving untrusted data or external inputs; purely class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs detected; simple class inheritance for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only custom exception class definitions, inheriting from standard Python error classes. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. No hardcoded credentials, malicious logic, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be part of a larger project for building Elasticsearch queries, solely defining error types.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and harmless, serving as error class definitions without any malicious intent or security risks.",
