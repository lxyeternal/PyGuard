{
  "purpose": "Defines mappings for various Elasticsearch query types and structures for internal use within the ElasticQuery module.",
  "sources": "Imports from .dsl (BaseQuery, MetaQuery) and .exceptions (NoQueryError); static dictionary QUERIES containing query definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that execute untrusted code or send data externally; no network connections or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input through the query definitions and into query construction, with no evident execution of untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed. The code is straightforward data structure definitions and class declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a comprehensive set of query templates for Elasticsearch, with clearly defined arguments and options. It uses safe static data structures and standard class inheritance with no execution of external code or data manipulation. There are no signs of malicious payloads, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The import statements are standard, and the class implementation is minimal, focusing on metadata for query handling. Overall, the code appears to be a configuration or mapping layer for query objects, with no malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This module solely defines query mappings for Elasticsearch queries, using safe, static data structures. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code appears benign and intended for query construction within a larger application.",
