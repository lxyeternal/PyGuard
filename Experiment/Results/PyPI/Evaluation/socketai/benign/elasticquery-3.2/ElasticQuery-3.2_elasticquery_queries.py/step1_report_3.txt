{
  "purpose": "Defines mappings for various Elasticsearch query types used internally in ElasticQuery for constructing search queries.",
  "sources": "Imports from .dsl and .exceptions modules; no external or untrusted data sources are directly read within this file.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations; no untrusted data handling or output code present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; this module primarily contains static definitions and class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only static configuration mappings and class definitions; no suspicious code or dynamic execution observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive set of query configuration dictionaries mapping query types to their expected arguments and options. It uses static data structures, lambda functions for processing, and a class inheritance pattern with MetaQuery. No external input handling, network operations, or data manipulation is present. The code appears to be a standard, static configuration module for Elasticsearch queries, with no obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration and class definition module for internal query mappings. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and focused on query structure definitions.",
