{
  "purpose": "Defines static mappings and schemas for Elasticsearch queries used internally within the ElasticQuery library.",
  "sources": "Static data structures within the QUERIES dictionary, class inheritance from BaseQuery, and internal module imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external outputs, or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code does not process external input; it only provides static definitions used by other components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, static, and declarative with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration module containing dictionaries and class definitions for Elasticsearch query schemas. It imports standard and internal modules but does not execute dynamic code, handle external data, or perform network operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The class 'Query' extends a metaclass and uses these static definitions for internal query handling. The overall structure is safe, static, and intended for internal use only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static configuration data for Elasticsearch query mappings, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with its static, internal nature.",
