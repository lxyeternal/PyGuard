{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of Elasticsearch query configurations and a Query class for internal use within the elasticquery package.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.dsl' and '.exceptions' modules, and the QUERIES dictionary which contains query configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks found; no untrusted data outputs or network calls are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident; configuration data is static.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code primarily defines data structures and a class with standard inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a dictionary 'QUERIES' containing Elasticsearch query configurations. These configurations specify argument and keyword options for various query types, including full-text, term-level, compound, joining, geo, specialized, and span queries. The class 'Query' extends 'BaseQuery' with metadata for internal query handling, using a metaclass 'MetaQuery' and referencing the 'QUERIES' definitions. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or embedded secrets. The structure appears to be a static configuration setup for internal use, with no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration and class definition for query handling within an Elasticsearch-related package. It contains no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears safe with no security risks. The overall security risk score is very low.",
