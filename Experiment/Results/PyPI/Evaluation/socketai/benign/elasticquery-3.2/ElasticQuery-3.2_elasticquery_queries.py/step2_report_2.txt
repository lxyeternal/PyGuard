  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:  \n   All reports agree that the code is a static configuration module defining mappings for Elasticsearch queries. It includes a dictionary `QUERIES` with various query types, their expected arguments, and options, as well as a class `Query` that uses these definitions. The code imports standard modules and internal classes, but no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing that could be malicious.\n\n2. **Potential Malicious Indicators**:  \n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present.\n   - No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code is purely declarative, serving as a schema or configuration layer.\n   - No external data is processed or output, reducing attack surface.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:  \n   All reports consistently state that the code is benign, static, and safe. They note the absence of suspicious behaviors, malicious payloads, or obfuscation. The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0 or 0.95), indicating strong agreement.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All assign 0, consistent with the static, clear data structures.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: Very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), justified because the code is configuration-only and does not execute untrusted data or perform network operations.\n   - **Overall Risk**: The code appears safe, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns?**  \n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no hidden behaviors or obfuscation.\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:  \n   - The code could be part of a larger system; however, on its own, it poses no security threat.\n   - The definitions are static and do not process external input directly, further reducing risk.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (clear, static data structures)  \n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 (minimal, due to static configuration, but very low)\n\n**Summary**:  \nThis code is a benign, static configuration module defining Elasticsearch query mappings. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The provided reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.\n\n**Recommendation**:  \nNo changes needed to the scores or conclusions. The code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
