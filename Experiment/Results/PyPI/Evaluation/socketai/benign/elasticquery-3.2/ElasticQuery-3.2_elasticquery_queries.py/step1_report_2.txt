{
  "purpose": "Defines mappings for various Elasticsearch query types to internal query objects in a Python library.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially 'six', and the QUERIES dictionary defining query parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data could flow into the 'kwargs' and 'args' parameters of query definitions, but the code does not directly process untrusted input here.",
  "flows": "No dynamic input handling or data processing is shown; the code primarily defines static query structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code consists mainly of static data definitions and class declarations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports external modules, defines a comprehensive dictionary of Elasticsearch query mappings, and a class 'Query' that uses these definitions. There is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The code serves as configuration or schema for query construction, with no execution of untrusted data or network operations. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, static configuration for an Elasticsearch querying library. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. It solely defines query schema mappings and a class structure, with no runtime vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors detected.",
