{
  "purpose": "Defines internal mappings for Elasticsearch query objects, serving as a configuration and schema for constructing queries.",
  "sources": "Import statements (six, .dsl, .exceptions), the QUERIES dictionary, and class definition.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code primarily defines data structures and class metadata without executing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code does not process external input directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes query definitions for Elasticsearch with explicit schemas and validation via MetaQuery. It imports standard modules and internal classes for schema validation and exception handling. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior is observed. The structure is typical for configuration or schema setup in a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, safe schema definition for Elasticsearch queries. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code detected. It solely defines query structures and metadata for internal use.",
