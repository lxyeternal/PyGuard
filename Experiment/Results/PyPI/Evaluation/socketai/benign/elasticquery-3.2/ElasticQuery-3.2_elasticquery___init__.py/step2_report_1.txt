  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is only import statements with a linter suppression directive. No executable logic, data handling, or suspicious activity.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The confidence is perfect. No change needed.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard import statements.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. Same as above—only import statements, no malicious activity.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The confidence is high; no change needed.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard package code.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. Again, only import statements with suppression comment.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** No.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The risk score is very low (0.1), which is acceptable given the context.  \n- **Justification for risk score:** Since the code is purely import statements, the low risk score is justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is just imports, with a suppression comment.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The confidence is high, and the risk score is appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues Present?** No. Only import statements, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Errors or Flaws?** None.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The low risk score aligns with the code's nature.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are zero, which is appropriate given the straightforward import statements.  \n- **Risk Score:** All are very low (0 or 0.1), which is reasonable for this benign code snippet.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the uniformity and simplicity of the code, I agree with the assessments. The only potential point of contention could be the suppression comment (`# flake8: noqa`). While it might sometimes be used to hide issues, in this context, it’s common in package code and not suspicious.\n\n**My adjusted scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.05 (a very slight increase over 0, acknowledging that suppression comments can sometimes hide issues, but in this context, it's negligible)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports correctly reflect the benign nature of this code snippet.",
