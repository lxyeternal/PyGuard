  "purpose": "Import statements for various classes from local modules, likely for a search or query system.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local module files: elasticquery, queries, aggregates, suggesters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leakage operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, which load classes from local modules. There are no dynamic code executions, data processing, network operations, or handling of untrusted data. This fragment appears to be a typical part of a larger package's __init__.py or module import section, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The code functions as a simple import statement block.",
