  "purpose": "A class for building Elasticsearch queries, facilitating query construction, aggregation, suggestion, and execution.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (e.g., query, aggregates, suggesters, key-value pairs), internal attributes (_struct, _query, _aggs, _suggesters).",
  "sinks": "Calls to external Elasticsearch client methods (search, count), JSON serialization via json.dumps.",
  "flows": "User-provided parameters flow into internal data structures (_struct, _query, _aggs, _suggesters), which are then used in Elasticsearch API calls or serialized to JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. Code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Elasticsearch query builder class, with methods for setting query parameters, aggregations, suggestions, and execution. It serializes data safely and interacts with Elasticsearch via provided client instance. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security flaws are present. The data flow is typical for such utility classes, and the code does not perform any unsafe operations. The low security risk score (0.2) appropriately reflects potential misuse if user inputs are malicious, but this is inherent to query construction tools and not a code flaw. The malware score is 0, as there are no malicious actions, backdoors, or harmful behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured Elasticsearch query utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its functionality.",
