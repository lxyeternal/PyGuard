  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting arguments to Elasticsearch DSL format, including validation and struct creation.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to functions like make_struct, _parse_args, _parse_kwargs, and data passed to unroll_struct and unroll_definitions.",
  "sinks": "Data structures returned by make_struct, which could be used as part of Elasticsearch queries. No direct sinks for untrusted data affecting system or network.",
  "flows": "Input args/kwargs → validation functions → struct creation in make_struct → potential nested data in unroll_struct and unroll_definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code appears to perform validation and struct creation with standard Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions to validate, parse, and generate nested data structures from input arguments for Elasticsearch queries. It includes validation for types, presence, and structure, with proper error handling. The use of the six library ensures compatibility across Python versions. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident, such as network activity, file system access, or obfuscated logic. The functions process input data for expected format and do not execute or evaluate untrusted code. The overall design is straightforward and intended for safe data handling, with no evident malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for constructing Elasticsearch query structures, with thorough validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks present.",
