  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting arguments into Elasticsearch DSL query structures, including validation, parsing, and unrolling of definitions.",
  "sources": "Function arguments, such as 'args', 'kwargs', and their specifications; class attributes like '_eq_type' and methods like 'dict()'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted input data from 'args' and 'kwargs' used in _parse_args, _parse_kwargs, and make_struct functions; data returned by 'dict()' on objects with '_eq_type'.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'args' and 'kwargs' flows through validation (_check_input, _check_arg), then into structured dicts via _parse_args and _parse_kwargs, possibly processed by 'process' or 'field_process' functions, and unrolled via unroll_struct.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious variable names. Use of 'six' for compatibility is standard. No hardcoded credentials or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for handling query argument validation, struct creation, and unrolling nested objects. Validation functions check input types and presence, raising errors if mismatched. 'make_struct' constructs nested dicts based on definitions, allowing custom processing functions. 'unroll_struct' recursively converts objects with '_eq_type' attribute into dicts, which is typical for ORM or query objects. The flow from input to output appears controlled and predictable. No external network operations, file access, or data exfiltration methods are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security exploits. The only potential concern could be the use of 'dict()' method on objects with '_eq_type' attribute, which might be part of a larger system, but in isolation, it does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for building and processing Elasticsearch query structures, with proper validation and data handling. It does not contain malicious code or malware. No security risks are evident beyond typical data validation, which is appropriate for such utilities.",
