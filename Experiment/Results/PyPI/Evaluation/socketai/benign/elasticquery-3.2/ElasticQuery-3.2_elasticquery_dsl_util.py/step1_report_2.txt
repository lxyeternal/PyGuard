  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting arguments into Elasticsearch query DSL structures, including parsing and validation of inputs.",
  "sources": "Input arguments to functions such as make_struct, _parse_args, _parse_kwargs, and the provided args/kwargs.",
  "sinks": "Data structures returned by make_struct, unroll_struct, and functions that may be used to build Elasticsearch queries.",
  "flows": "Input args/kwargs -> validation and parsing -> structured dicts -> Elasticsearch query DSL structures",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'six' for Python 2/3 compatibility (not suspicious). No external or network code present. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors observed. The code appears straightforward for its purpose, with validation and transformation logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions for parsing, validating, and constructing Elasticsearch query structures from input arguments. It includes input validation, type checking, and structured data generation. There are no network calls, system modifications, or sensitive data handling observed. The functions are typical utility functions that could be used safely within an application, with proper validation. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for building Elasticsearch query DSLs, performing input validation, and data structuring. It does not contain any malicious behavior or malware. The overall security risk is minimal, with no suspicious activity detected.",
