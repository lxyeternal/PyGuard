  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting args/kwargs to Elasticsearch DSL, focusing on validation, struct creation, and unrolling nested structures.",
  "sources": "Input arguments (args, kwargs), data structures, and nested objects with potential dynamic processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Data structures used for Elasticsearch queries; no external sinks like network or file operations detected.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation functions, into structured dicts, possibly processed by dynamic functions, then unrolled into nested dicts.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic 'field_process' and 'process' functions for extensibility; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation, type checking, and structuring for Elasticsearch query building. No network activity, file operations, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic functions are intended for flexible processing, not malicious intent. The validation mitigates risks from untrusted input. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses common patterns for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module for Elasticsearch query construction with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) are justified given its purpose. No modifications are necessary.",
