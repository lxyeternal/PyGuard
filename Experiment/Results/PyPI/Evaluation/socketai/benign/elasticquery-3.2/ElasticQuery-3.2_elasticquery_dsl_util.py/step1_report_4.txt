  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting arguments to Elasticsearch DSL, including parsing, validation, and structuring of input data.",
  "sources": "Input arguments in functions such as _parse_args, _parse_kwargs, make_struct, and unroll_struct.",
  "sinks": "Potential data structures returned by make_struct, _parse_args, _parse_kwargs, or passed to unroll_struct, which could be used downstream.",
  "flows": "Input args/kwargs are validated and processed into structured dicts, which are then unrolled for nested or object-like structures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic function calls (field_process, process), and unrolling of objects with '_eq_type' attributes. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious string patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious string evals. No network activity or system modification observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles argument validation, structuring, and unrolling for Elasticsearch query generation. It includes input checks, type validation, and flexible structure creation, with optional post-processing functions. No external data fetching, network activity, or system modifications are present. The dynamic function calls for 'field_process' and 'process' are designed for extensibility but do not suggest malicious intent. The code does not handle or store sensitive data, nor does it perform any operations that would be indicative of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard utility for query structuring with no evident malicious behavior or security issues. It performs input validation and data structuring for Elasticsearch DSL queries. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network/system activities are detected.",
