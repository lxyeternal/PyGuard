{
  "purpose": "Define metaclasses and base classes for constructing Elasticsearch query and aggregation objects, including support for dynamic attribute access.",
  "sources": "Code imports functions from .dsl_util; uses class attribute access and method calls to generate query structures.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly found; no direct data output to network or external systems; dict() methods generate data structures.",
  "flows": "Class attribute access (__getattr__) to generate query/aggregation objects; instantiation of classes; dict() methods to produce data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. Usage of lambdas in __getattr__ may obscure class instantiation but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines metaclasses for dynamic attribute handling, creating query and aggregation objects with nested structures. The use of lambdas in __getattr__ may hide object creation, but this is a common pattern for DSL-like APIs. No network activity, data leaks, or system modifications are present. The code does not execute external commands, handle sensitive data, or include suspicious behavior. The purpose appears to be structured query generation for Elasticsearch, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a structured, legitimate implementation of a DSL for Elasticsearch queries and aggregations, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It appears safe and purpose-driven for its intended use.",
