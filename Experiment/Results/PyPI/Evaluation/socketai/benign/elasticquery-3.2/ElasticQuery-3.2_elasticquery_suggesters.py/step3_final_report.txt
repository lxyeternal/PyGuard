{
  "purpose": "Defines Elasticsearch suggesters and a class to manage them within a Python application.",
  "sources": "Static definitions in the SUGGESTERS dictionary, class inheritance, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external outputs; primarily static configuration.",
  "flows": "Class and dictionary definitions are static; no runtime data flow or external data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of suggesters mapping for Elasticsearch, with no dynamic code execution, external inputs, or network operations. The reports indicating 'Empty response' lack context and do not relate to this static module. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are evident. The code appears benign and correctly structured for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration module for Elasticsearch suggesters. The reports do not provide evidence of security issues or malicious activity. Scores for malware and obfuscation should be 0; risk score should be very low (~0.1) due to lack of issues.",
