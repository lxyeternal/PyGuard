  "purpose": "Expose the LogDNAHandler class for logging configuration and usage",
  "sources": "Import statement from .logdna module, assignment to logging.handlers.LogDNAHandler",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication observed",
  "flows": "The import loads a class, which is then assigned to a logging handlers namespace for later use",
  "anomalies": "Assigning a class from a local module directly to a standard library namespace (logging.handlers) without validation; this is unusual but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports LogDNAHandler from a local module, exposes it via __all__, and assigns it to the standard logging.handlers namespace. This allows the class to be used directly in logging configuration files. No input validation, data flow, or untrusted data processing occurs. The modification of logging.handlers namespace is unconventional but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for exposing a custom logging handler for configuration purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious data handling, or security issues. The unusual assignment to logging.handlers namespace is noteworthy but not harmful.",
