  "purpose": "Expose and re-export the LogDNAHandler class for logging configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .logdna module; assignment to logging.handlers.LogDNAHandler",
  "sinks": "Assignment to logging.handlers.LogDNAHandler allows potential override or injection if the logging.handlers module is malicious or compromised",
  "flows": "Import from local module -> assign to logging.handlers attribute",
  "anomalies": "Assigning a class to logging.handlers at runtime could be unusual; no validation or security checks on LogDNAHandler are shown, but this is a standard pattern for extending logging modules",
  "analysis": "The code imports LogDNAHandler from a relative module, then assigns it to the logging.handlers namespace. This allows the handler to be used in logging configuration files. No suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious logic is present. The modification of the logging.handlers namespace is unconventional but not inherently malicious. It does not involve external inputs or secret data. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for extending logging modules with custom handlers, with no signs of malicious activity. It is benign in behavior and structure.",
