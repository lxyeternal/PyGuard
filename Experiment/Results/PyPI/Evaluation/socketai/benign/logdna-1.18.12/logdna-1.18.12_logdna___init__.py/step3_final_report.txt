  "purpose": "Expose the LogDNAHandler class for logging configuration by importing it locally, exposing via __all__, and injecting into logging.handlers namespace.",
  "sources": "Import from .logdna module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external communication; no data leaks or malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "Import -> assignment to logging.handlers.LogDNAHandler.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional modification of standard library namespace at runtime.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local class LogDNAHandler, exposes it via __all__, and assigns it to logging.handlers.LogDNAHandler. This is an unusual but not malicious pattern, primarily for making the handler accessible via logging configuration. No malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The main concern is the namespace modification, which could cause conflicts but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign a malware score of 0. The security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the unconventional namespace assignment but no active threat. The code is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with an unconventional but non-malicious namespace modification. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate. No further action required, but caution in environments sensitive to namespace modifications is advised.",
