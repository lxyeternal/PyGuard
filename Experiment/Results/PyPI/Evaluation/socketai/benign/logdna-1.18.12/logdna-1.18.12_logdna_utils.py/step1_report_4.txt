{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for checking if objects are JSON serializable, normalizing list options, sanitizing metadata, and retrieving the local IP address.",
  "sources": "Input sources include options parameter (dictionary) in normalize_list_option, and meta parameter (dictionary) in sanitize_meta. Data is read via options.get(), meta.items(), and socket operations.",
  "sinks": "Data sinks involve json.dumps() for serialization, socket.connect() for network operations, and potential modification of meta dictionary.",
  "flows": "Input from options or meta is processed through serialization checks or sanitization. get_ip() establishes a socket connection to determine local IP, then closes socket.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. socket connection used solely to retrieve local IP.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility functions: verifying JSON serializability, normalizing options input, sanitizing metadata by removing non-serializable keys, and obtaining the local IP address via a socket connection. No network data is sent externally; socket connection is local. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears safe and standard for typical application use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing utility functions without any malicious intent or suspicious activity. No malware or security risks identified. It simply handles data validation, sanitization, and local IP retrieval.",
