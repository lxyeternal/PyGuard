{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for JSON serialization, list normalization, metadata sanitization, and obtaining the local IP address.",
  "sources": "Input sources include 'options' (function parameter), 'meta' (function parameter), and network connection attempts in 'get_ip'.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if 'meta' contains sensitive data, but the code only sanitizes or serializes data. The 'socket' connection in 'get_ip' involves network communication.",
  "flows": "Data from 'options' and 'meta' are processed and sanitized, with possible JSON serialization. The 'get_ip' function flows involve socket connection and IP retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code detected. The socket connection in 'get_ip' is benign and used to retrieve local IP. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors present. The code uses standard libraries without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs JSON serialization checks, list normalization, metadata sanitization, and local IP address retrieval. It handles errors gracefully and does not contain malicious behavior. The socket connection in 'get_ip' is standard for obtaining local IP and does not send data externally. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic identified. The overall design appears safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions with no signs of malicious intent. It focuses on data validation, sanitization, and system information retrieval in a benign manner.",
