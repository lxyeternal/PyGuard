{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for JSON serialization validation, list normalization, metadata sanitization, and local IP retrieval.",
  "sources": "Input data in 'meta' parameter, options dictionary, socket connection for IP address.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage if 'meta' contains sensitive info, socket connection for IP retrieval.",
  "flows": "Input data (meta/options) processed through sanitization and normalization functions; socket connects to retrieve local IP.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; socket connection is standard for IP detection; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard utility functions with no malicious intent. 'is_jsonable' checks JSON serializability, 'normalize_list_option' processes options, 'sanitize_meta' cleans meta data, and 'get_ip' retrieves local IP via socket. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The socket usage is typical and safe. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The scores and assessments in all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
