  "purpose": "Utility functions for JSON serialization validation, list normalization, metadata sanitization, and IP address retrieval.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from options dictionary, meta dictionary, and network socket.",
  "sinks": "The socket connection for IP retrieval and JSON dumping functions could be considered data sinks if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Input options and meta data flow through functions, potentially being sanitized or serialized, and socket connection data is used for IP detection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. The socket connection to a non-reachable IP is standard for IP detection but could be misused if contextually malicious.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform standard data validation and sanitization tasks. 'is_jsonable' attempts to serialize objects to JSON, 'normalize_list_option' processes string or list inputs, and 'sanitize_meta' cleans meta data by removing non-serializable items and optionally serializing it. 'get_ip' creates a UDP socket to determine the machine's IP address without sending data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration; the socket use is typical for obtaining local IP. No external or hidden network activity is evident. The code appears safe and intended for utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard utility operations without malicious intent. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior, with no suspicious data flows or backdoors. The socket use is legitimate for IP detection, and data sanitization is routine.",
