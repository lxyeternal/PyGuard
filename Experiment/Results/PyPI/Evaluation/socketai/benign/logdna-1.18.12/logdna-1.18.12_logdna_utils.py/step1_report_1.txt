  "purpose": "Utility functions for JSON serialization, list normalization, meta data sanitization, and obtaining local IP address.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'options' parameter, 'meta' dictionary, and socket connection to retrieve local IP.",
  "sinks": "Potential leakage or misuse of the IP address retrieved, JSON serialization of data, and modification of 'meta' data.",
  "flows": "Data from 'options' and 'meta' are processed and sanitized; 'get_ip' retrieves local IP which could be used for network-related purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code found. The functions perform common tasks with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data handling. No unusual network activity, no obfuscated code, and no external data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code includes functions to check JSON serializability, normalize list options from a string or list, sanitize meta information by removing non-JSON-serializable keys, and obtain the local IP address via socket connection. The socket usage appears standard for local network info retrieval. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden payloads. The code’s structure and logic are straightforward and typical for utility modules. No suspicious anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign utility functions intended for data processing and network information retrieval. No malicious intent or security risks are identified.",
