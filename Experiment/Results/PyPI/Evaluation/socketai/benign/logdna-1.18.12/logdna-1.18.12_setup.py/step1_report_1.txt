  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'logdna' Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads the VERSION file to determine package version.",
  "sinks": "Uses the version string to construct download URL; no untrusted data execution or data leakage points observed.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from file -> passes metadata to setup() without modification or execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations. It reads external files for description and version info. The version file is read from a relative path, which is typical for setup scripts. No untrusted input is executed or transmitted. The dependencies and metadata appear legitimate. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware signs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py script with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It performs standard package configuration tasks.",
