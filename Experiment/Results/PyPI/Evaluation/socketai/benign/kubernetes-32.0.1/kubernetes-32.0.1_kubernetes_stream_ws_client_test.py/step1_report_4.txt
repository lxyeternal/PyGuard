{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for testing WebSocket URL conversions and proxy configuration handling within a Kubernetes-related project.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include hardcoded URL strings, environment configurations via the 'Configuration' object, and module imports.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly send data over the network or write to files; it primarily processes URLs and configuration parameters for proxy settings.",
  "flows": "Test functions generate URLs and proxy configurations, then verify their correct transformation and handling, with no untrusted data flow leading to security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. Usage of 'urllib3.disable_warnings()' is standard in some contexts, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a unit testing module verifying URL conversions and proxy configurations. It imports standard and external libraries responsibly, performs no network calls or data exfiltration, and contains no obfuscated or malicious code. Proxy handling uses user-supplied strings, but these are used only in test scenarios, not in production data flows. No signs of malware, credential theft, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign testing suite focused on URL and proxy configuration validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities. It functions solely within a testing context without any suspicious data flows or operations.",
