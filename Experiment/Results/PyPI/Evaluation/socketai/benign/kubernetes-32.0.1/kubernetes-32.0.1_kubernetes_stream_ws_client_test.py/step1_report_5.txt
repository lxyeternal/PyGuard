  "purpose": "The code defines unit tests for WebSocket URL conversion and proxy configuration handling within a Kubernetes-related project.",
  "sources": "Reads input URLs for WebSocket and proxy configurations, and configuration data from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data is used in a way that leads to data leaks or security impacts.",
  "flows": "Input URLs and configuration parameters are processed to produce WebSocket URLs and proxy settings, but no harmful data flow or command execution is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. Proxy handling is standard, with no signs of malicious data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a test suite for WebSocket URL conversion and proxy configuration. It imports necessary modules, disables urllib3 warnings, and defines utility functions. The test cases validate URL conversions and proxy setup logic. No input validation vulnerabilities, code injections, or malicious behavior are evident. The code operates solely within testing context, with no data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code is well-structured, with no anomalies or signs of obfuscation. Overall, the code appears to be purely for testing purposes, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for WebSocket and proxy configuration functions. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It operates within a controlled testing context and shows no signs of sabotage or security threats.",
