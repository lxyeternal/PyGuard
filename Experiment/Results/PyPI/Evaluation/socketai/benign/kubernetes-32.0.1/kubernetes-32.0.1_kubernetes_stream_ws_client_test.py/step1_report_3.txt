  "purpose": "Unit testing functions for WebSocket URL conversion and proxy configuration handling in a Kubernetes client context.",
  "sources": "get_websocket_url function, websocket_proxycare function, imported modules (urllib3, kubernetes.client.configuration), and configuration objects.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; code does not write untrusted data or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Input URLs and proxy configurations flow through functions to produce proxy settings, but these are limited to configuration parsing and URL conversion without executing external commands or malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is standard unit testing with straightforward URL and proxy handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines unit tests for URL conversion and proxy configuration parsing, relying on standard libraries and functions. It disables urllib3 warnings, which is common in testing environments. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. No suspicious external connections or obfuscated code. The code's structure is typical for test cases, focusing solely on validating expected outputs given various inputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate test code for validating URL and proxy configuration handling within a Kubernetes client environment. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It solely performs configuration validation and URL transformation without external or harmful actions.",
