  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of unit tests for WebSocket URL conversion and proxy configuration handling.\n- The code operates on static, hardcoded URLs and configuration objects.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or data exfiltration are involved.\n- The code uses standard libraries and practices; no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malware or security risks.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of malicious behavior:** None of the reports identify any malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security risk scores:** Mostly 0, with some reports noting very low risks (~0.1), likely due to the use of standard practices like disabling warnings, which is common in testing but not inherently risky.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The code does not process untrusted data in a harmful way.\n- It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or execute external commands.\n- Proxy configurations are set up for testing purposes, not for malicious purposes.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present; even if present, they are in test scenarios.\n- The functions tested are standard utility functions, not security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign test suite with no malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or near-zero) are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary; the assessments are consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to zero, e.g., 0.1 if considering minor testing practices)\n\nThis code is safe, straightforward, and contains no security threats.",
