{
  "purpose": "The code defines unit tests for WebSocket URL conversion and proxy configuration handling, mainly for a Kubernetes client component.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from hardcoded URL strings, environment configurations via the kubernetes.client.configuration.Configuration object, and module imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are evident; no output beyond test assertions and configuration setup occurs.",
  "flows": "Input URLs are processed by get_websocket_url to produce websocket URLs; proxy configuration data is used by websocket_proxycare to generate connection options.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. External library usage (urllib3, unittest) is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard unit tests without data processing from untrusted sources. It verifies URL transformations and proxy configurations. No malicious logic, data leaks, or suspicious activities are detected. The code appears to be safe, well-structured testing code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for WebSocket URL and proxy configuration functions. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a safe, benign testing module.",
