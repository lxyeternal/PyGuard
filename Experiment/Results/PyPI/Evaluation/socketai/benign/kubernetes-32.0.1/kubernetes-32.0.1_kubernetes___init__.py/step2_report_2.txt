  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code snippet is a standard header for an open-source project, specifically for the Kubernetes project.\n   - It contains licensing information, project metadata, and import statements.\n   - There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic within this snippet.\n   - The imports are from local modules, which are typical in a package structure.\n\n2. **Report Content:**\n   - All five reports indicate an \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n   - There are no specific details, code snippets, or evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior.\n\n3. **Assessment of Report Validity:**\n   - Since the reports contain no details beyond \"Empty response,\" they do not provide any evidence of issues such as malware, vulnerabilities, or malicious code.\n   - The reports seem to be placeholders or failures in retrieving or processing data, not actual security findings.\n\n4. **Error Analysis:**\n   - The \"Empty response\" error suggests that whatever system or endpoint was queried did not return any data.\n   - This could be due to network issues, misconfiguration, or simply no data being available.\n   - Importantly, this does not indicate malicious activity or vulnerabilities in the code.\n\n5. **Scores and Risk Evaluation:**\n   - Without concrete evidence or details, assigning high malware or obfuscation scores would be unjustified.\n   - The absence of evidence of malicious activity, combined with the lack of detailed reports, warrants low scores across the board.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the available data, there is no indication of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.\n   - The \"Empty response\" reports are likely non-issues or system errors rather than security incidents.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no signs of obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal risk, mainly due to system errors, not security issues)\n\n**Note:** If future reports contain detailed evidence or code snippets indicating malicious behavior, these scores should be revisited accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports do not provide any concrete evidence of security issues. The code snippet is standard and benign. The \"Empty response\" errors are likely system or network issues rather than security concerns. Therefore, the overall risk remains very low.",
