  "purpose": "A Kubernetes API watcher that streams resource events, deserializes JSON data into model objects, and handles errors such as stream expiration.",
  "sources": "resp.stream() providing network data; pydoc.getdoc() extracting function documentation; JSON data from network responses.",
  "sinks": "json.loads() deserializing JSON data; self._api_client.deserialize() converting raw JSON into model objects.",
  "flows": "Network stream segments → buffer accumulation → newline splitting → JSON parsing → object deserialization → yielding event objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. Uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard Kubernetes resource watch, streaming data from the network, parsing JSON, and deserializing into models. Error handling for stream expiration is properly managed. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The deserialization relies on the Kubernetes client, which is typical. The use of pydoc.getdoc() is benign. Overall, the code is a legitimate, well-structured API watcher with low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Kubernetes resource watcher with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to processing untrusted JSON data, which is inherent in such clients. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0; the risk score of approximately 0.1 is justified. Overall, the code is safe and legitimate.",
