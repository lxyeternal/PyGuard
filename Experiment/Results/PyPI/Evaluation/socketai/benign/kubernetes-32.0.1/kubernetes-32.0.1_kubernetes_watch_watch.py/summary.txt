  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Kubernetes resource watcher with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to processing untrusted JSON data, which is inherent in such clients. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0; the risk score of approximately 0.1 is justified. Overall, the code is safe and legitimate."
