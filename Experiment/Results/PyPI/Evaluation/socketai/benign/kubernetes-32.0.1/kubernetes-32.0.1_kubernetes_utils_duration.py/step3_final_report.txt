  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing and formatting duration strings according to GEP-2257 standards, ensuring validation, range enforcement, and conversion between string and timedelta representations.",
  "sources": "Input duration strings validated via regex; no external data sources or system calls.",
  "sinks": "Parsed timedelta objects returned; no untrusted data sinks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex validation -> parse with durationpy -> range checks -> timedelta object -> formatting back to string if needed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs strict validation of duration strings using regex, enforces maximum duration limits, and handles conversion with 'durationpy'. It correctly rejects invalid, negative, or overly long durations, and formats timedelta objects into the specified string format. No external system calls, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The use of 'durationpy' is standard and benign. The validation logic and exception handling are appropriate, minimizing security risks. The code is purpose-specific, straightforward, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for handling duration strings with comprehensive validation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified, primarily due to dependency trust and validation scope. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for production use.",
