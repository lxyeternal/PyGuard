{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to parse and format durations according to the GEP-2257 specification, primarily for use within Kubernetes or related systems.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters 'duration' (string) and 'delta' (datetime.timedelta). It also uses a precompiled regex pattern for validation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not write or transmit data. It raises exceptions on invalid input, which is standard validation behavior.",
  "flows": "Input strings are validated with regex and then converted using 'durationpy.from_str'. The formatted output is constructed from timedelta components, with error handling for invalid ranges or formats.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The code performs straightforward parsing and formatting with proper validation. No obfuscated code or hidden logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code rigorously validates duration strings using a precompiled regex to prevent invalid formats, such as floating points or negatives. The 'parse_duration' function converts the string to a timedelta object safely. Conversely, 'format_duration' converts timedelta back into a string, ensuring sub-millisecond or negative durations are rejected. It respects maximum duration limits. No data leaks, external connections, or malicious behaviors are present. Usage of standard libraries and clear validation indicates benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured utility for handling duration strings in a specific format. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs input validation and formatting as intended without any suspicious activity.",
