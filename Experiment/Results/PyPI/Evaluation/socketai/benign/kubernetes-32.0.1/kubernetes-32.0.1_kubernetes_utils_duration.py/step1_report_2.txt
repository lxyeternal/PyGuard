{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to parse and format duration strings in the GEP-2257 format, ensuring durations are within specified constraints.",
  "sources": "Input: function parameters 'duration' (string), internal regex matching, and timedelta objects; No external data sources or untrusted inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "The functions output formatted duration strings or raise exceptions; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex validation -> durationpy parsing -> timedelta object -> formatting -> output string; No untrusted data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code strictly handles duration parsing/formatting with input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation through regex to ensure only valid duration formats are processed, preventing invalid or malicious input. The parse_duration function converts validated strings to timedelta objects, and format_duration converts timedelta back to string while enforcing constraints like range, sub-millisecond precision, and non-negativity. There are no evident data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors; all operations are straightforward and within intended scope. No external or network interactions are present, and third-party library usage (re, datetime, durationpy) is standard and benign. The code is well-structured, with proper validation and exception handling, reducing risk of malicious manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is solely for validating and formatting duration strings within specified constraints, with no signs of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It handles input validation, range enforcement, and precise formatting in a secure manner.",
