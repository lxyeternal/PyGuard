{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to parse and format duration strings in a restricted format for use within Kubernetes, specifically adhering to GEP-2257 standards.",
  "sources": "Input is the 'duration' string parameter for parse_duration, and the 'delta' parameter for format_duration.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data influences system commands, external systems, or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input duration string flows through regex validation into durationpy.from_str() for parsing; formatted timedelta outputs do not feed back into untrusted systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. Code uses standard libraries and no obfuscated features. The regex is straightforward, and no suspicious network or system calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly validates and processes duration strings with a predefined regex, then uses durationpy to parse these strings into timedelta objects. The formatting function converts timedelta back into the specific string format, with checks for sub-millisecond precision and duration limits. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The code is well-structured, with proper validation and exception handling, focusing solely on duration parsing and formatting. No external data sources, sinks, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for handling duration strings according to GEP-2257. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured and adheres to its intended purpose without any suspicious activity.",
