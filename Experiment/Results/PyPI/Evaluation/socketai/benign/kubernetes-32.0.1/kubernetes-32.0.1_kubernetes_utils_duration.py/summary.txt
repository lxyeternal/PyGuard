  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for handling duration strings with comprehensive validation. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified, primarily due to dependency trust and validation scope. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for production use."
