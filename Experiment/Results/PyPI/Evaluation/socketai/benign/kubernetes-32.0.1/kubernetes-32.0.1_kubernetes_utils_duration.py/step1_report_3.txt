{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to parse and format durations according to the GEP-2257 specification, which is used in Kubernetes API configurations.",
  "sources": "Input: function parameters 'duration' in parse_duration(), system datetime in format_duration().",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external system interaction are present; the code performs purely computational tasks.",
  "flows": "Input strings are validated against a regex, then converted to timedelta; timedelta objects are formatted back into strings without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses regex and durationpy library for parsing, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex for duration validation, parses duration strings into timedelta objects, and formats timedelta objects back into strings. It checks for validity, range, and precision constraints, raising exceptions for invalid formats. No external system calls, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. All operations are purely computational and adhere to expected standards for duration handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for parsing and formatting durations according to a specific standard. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is reliance on an external library (durationpy), but this is a benign dependency used for conversions. Overall, the code appears safe and purpose-specific, with no security risks identified.",
