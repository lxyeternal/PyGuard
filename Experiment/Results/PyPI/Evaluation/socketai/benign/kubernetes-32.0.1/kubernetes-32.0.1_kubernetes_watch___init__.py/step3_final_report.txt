{
  "purpose": "The code is a minimal import statement with licensing comments, serving as part of a larger Python project, likely in Kubernetes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from licensing comments and the local module '.watch'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports a module without executing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and a simple import statement, with no executable logic, data handling, or untrusted input. It is standard, benign, and lacks any signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No anomalies or suspicious features are detected. The code's benign nature is confirmed by the absence of dynamic behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard import statement with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign. No further action or concern is warranted.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
