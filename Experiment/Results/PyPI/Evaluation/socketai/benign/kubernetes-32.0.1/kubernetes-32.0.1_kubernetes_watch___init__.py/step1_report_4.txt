  "purpose": "Import the Watch class from a local module, likely for monitoring or observing resources in Kubernetes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module file '.watch'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output.",
  "flows": "Import statement reads the Watch class; no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a standard import statement with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of licensing comments and a single import statement importing Watch from a local module. No input, data processing, or output operations are present. The code appears to be part of a larger module or package and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The only notable aspect is the licensing information, which is standard for open-source projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign import statement accompanied by licensing comments. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a typical part of an open-source codebase, and no threats are detected.",
