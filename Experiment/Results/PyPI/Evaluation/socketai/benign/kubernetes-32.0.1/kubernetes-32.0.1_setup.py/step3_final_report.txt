  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for configuring and installing the Kubernetes client package, reading dependencies from external files.",
  "sources": "Reads dependency specifications from 'requirements.txt' and 'test-requirements.txt' files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution or network operations.",
  "flows": "Dependency data flows from external files into the setup configuration without transformation or execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is static, straightforward, and follows common packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads dependencies from external files, processes them to exclude comments, and passes them to setuptools.setup(). It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports agree on its benign nature. The dependency files are external and assumed to be controlled; the script itself is safe. The slight risk score of 0.1 in one report is likely an overestimation, as no malicious behavior is present. Overall, the code is a legitimate, standard package configuration with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It follows best practices and does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic.",
