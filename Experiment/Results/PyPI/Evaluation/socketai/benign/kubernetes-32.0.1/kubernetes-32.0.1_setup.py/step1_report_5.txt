{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the Python Kubernetes client library, used for package installation and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reading 'test-requirements.txt' for test dependencies, and static metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; no external data or user input is processed at runtime beyond reading static files.",
  "flows": "The script reads dependencies from text files, processes them, and passes them to setup() for package configuration. No external untrusted input is directly executed or evaluated.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads dependency data from local files, processes them into lists, and configures the package setup with static metadata. It adheres to standard Python packaging practices. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses common patterns for Python package setup. No external or untrusted sources are executed or evaluated. All data appears static and controlled.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python setup script for a public package with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs standard dependency and metadata configuration without any security concerns.",
