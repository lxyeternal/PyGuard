  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the Kubernetes Python client package, including dependencies, package metadata, and installation instructions.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'requirements.txt' and 'test-requirements.txt' files for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code primarily loads dependencies and configuration data.",
  "flows": "Reading dependency files -> setting variables -> passing data to setup() -> package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The file strictly manages package setup and dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures, including reading dependency lists from files and configuring package metadata. It uses safe, well-known Python packaging practices without dynamic execution or obfuscated code. No external or untrusted input processing is present that could lead to security issues. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package. It follows standard practices without malicious or suspicious elements. No security risks or malware signals detected.",
