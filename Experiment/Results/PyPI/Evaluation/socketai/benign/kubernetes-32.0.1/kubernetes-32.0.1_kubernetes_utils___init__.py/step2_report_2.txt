  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Context**:\n   - The code snippet appears to be part of an open-source project, specifically related to Kubernetes.\n   - It includes licensing information and imports from local modules: `create_from_yaml`, `quantity`, and `duration`.\n   - Notably, there is a typo in the import statement: `from. duration import parse_duration` (missing space after `from`).\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Vulnerable Code**:\n   - The code itself is straightforward, mainly imports, and contains no executable logic or suspicious patterns.\n   - The typo in the import statement could cause a syntax error, but it is not malicious.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All five reports show `\"error\": \"Empty response\"` with no additional details.\n   - The raw responses are empty strings, indicating no actual report content or findings.\n   - These reports do not provide any evidence of vulnerabilities, malware, or security issues.\n\n4. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:\n   - The reports are uninformative; they do not contain any details about potential issues.\n   - The repeated \"Empty response\" errors suggest either a problem with the reporting tool or that no issues were found.\n   - No assumptions are made in the reports; they simply lack data.\n\n5. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - Since there are no findings, the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be very low or zero.\n   - The code itself has a minor syntax issue (missing space in import), but this is not security-related.\n   - Given the absence of any actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity, assigning higher scores would be unwarranted.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code snippet does not exhibit any malicious or security-critical flaws.\n   - The reports are empty, providing no evidence of issues.\n   - The only flaw in the code is a syntax typo, which is not security-related.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk Score**: 0.1 (very minor, related to syntax typo, not security)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe reports do not contain any meaningful information. The code is benign, and the reports' errors are due to lack of data rather than actual issues. Therefore, no significant risk or malware concerns are justified here.",
