  "review": "Let's analyze the provided information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code snippet appears to be a typical open-source Python module with license headers and import statements.\n   - The imports include relative imports from the same package, importing specific functions and classes.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious patterns in this snippet.\n   - The code appears to be legitimate and standard for a project like Kubernetes.\n\n2. **Reports Analysis:**\n   - All five reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n   - This suggests that the reports did not contain any actual content or details about potential issues.\n   - Since no detailed findings, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are provided, there is no evidence of security issues or malware.\n\n3. **Errors and Logical Flaws:**\n   - The reports themselves are uninformative, providing no insights or evidence.\n   - No logical flaws or errors can be identified based on empty responses.\n   - The absence of details makes it impossible to assess potential vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - Given the lack of evidence, the malware score should be **0**.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be **0**, as there's no indication of obfuscation.\n   - The risk score should be **0** because no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are demonstrated or implied.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The code snippet is straightforward and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.\n   - The import statements are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.\n   - The license headers are typical for open-source projects and do not raise concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code appears benign and standard.\n- **Errors or flaws in report logic:** Yes, the reports are empty and do not provide any meaningful data.\n- **Scores assigned:** The scores should all be **0** due to lack of evidence.\n- **Potential risks:** None apparent from the provided data.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis is a case where the reports do not contain any actionable information, and the code appears safe based on the provided snippet.",
