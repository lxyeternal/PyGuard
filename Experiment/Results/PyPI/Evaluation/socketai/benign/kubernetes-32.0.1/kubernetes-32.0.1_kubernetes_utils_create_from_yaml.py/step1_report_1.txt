{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for creating Kubernetes resources from YAML files or dictionaries, supporting server-side apply and namespace management.",
  "sources": "The code reads YAML files from a specified directory and YAML/ dictionary objects passed as arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with Kubernetes APIs to create resources, which could potentially be exploited if misused, but no direct sinks for malicious data exfiltration or system compromise are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from YAML files or objects (sources) into Kubernetes API calls (sinks) via create functions, with no evident malicious manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code uses standard libraries and Kubernetes API interactions, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations for loading YAML, processing lists or single objects, and creating Kubernetes resources via the API. It uses regex for formatting resource kinds, but this is routine. No network calls outside Kubernetes API interactions are present. No dynamic code execution, hidden behaviors, or malicious data handling identified. The exception class captures API exceptions but does not perform malicious actions. Overall, the code appears legitimate and aligns with typical Kubernetes client operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate Kubernetes resource creation utility with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It securely processes input files/objects and interacts with the Kubernetes API in a standard manner. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
