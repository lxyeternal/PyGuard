{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for managing Kubernetes resources via YAML files or directories, including creating resources using server-side apply or traditional create methods.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from YAML files, directories containing YAML files, and YAML objects passed directly as arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes output messages to standard output if verbose is enabled. No critical data sinks or external data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from YAML files or objects through parsing functions, then to Kubernetes API calls for resource creation, with optional verbose logging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No evidence of obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or misleading variables. The code is straightforward and primarily interacts with Kubernetes APIs. No dynamic evaluation or data exfiltration mechanisms detected.",
  "analysis": "The script implements resource creation workflows for Kubernetes using the Python client. It reads YAML files or objects, processes them into appropriate API calls, and handles both namespaced and cluster-wide resources. Error handling aggregates API exceptions. No signs of malicious behavior such as data theft, system damage, or covert communications. The code adheres to standard patterns for Kubernetes Python client interactions and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing Kubernetes resources, with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. Its functionality is typical for Kubernetes automation tools and does not include malicious behaviors or security vulnerabilities.",
