{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for creating Kubernetes resources from YAML files or dictionaries, primarily for use in automating resource deployment within a specified namespace.",
  "sources": "Reading YAML files (`yaml_file`), reading directory contents (`os.listdir`, `os.path.join`), reading file contents (`open`, `yaml.load_all`), accessing environment variables implicitly (through `os`), and input parameters like `yaml_dir`, `yaml_file`, `yaml_objects`.",
  "sinks": "Calling Kubernetes API methods such as `create_namespaced_*`, `create_*`, and `server_side_apply`, which are endpoints for resource creation. Also, printing logs if verbose is enabled, and dynamically constructing API calls based on YAML content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reading or YAML object input into Kubernetes API creation calls. YAML content is parsed and passed into create functions, which then call API methods to create resources in the cluster. No direct untrusted data manipulation beyond resource creation is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic detected. The code performs standard YAML parsing, API client calls, and resource creation. It does not perform any network communication outside of API interactions, nor does it include obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard implementation of Kubernetes resource creation utilities. It reads YAML files or objects, parses them, and invokes Kubernetes client API methods to create resources in a specified namespace, optionally using server-side apply. The functions handle errors gracefully via custom exceptions and support verbose logging. No code injections, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The dynamic construction of API calls and resource handling aligns with typical Kubernetes client operations, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing Kubernetes resources from YAML configurations. It follows standard practices without suspicious or malicious features. No malware, malicious payloads, or security risks are evident. The code is well-structured for its purpose, with appropriate error handling and no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
