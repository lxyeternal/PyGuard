  "purpose": "Utility for creating Kubernetes resources from YAML files or dictionaries, facilitating resource deployment and management.",
  "sources": "YAML files read from a directory, YAML objects provided directly, and resource definitions within these YAMLs.",
  "sinks": "API calls to Kubernetes server for resource creation; no untrusted data flows to external systems or network exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "YAML input -> parsing and transformation -> API resource creation calls (namespaced or cluster-wide) -> response handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Regex used for resource kind formatting is routine.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations for Kubernetes resource creation: reading YAML files, parsing them, transforming resource kinds, and invoking API methods. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. Error handling is conventional, and interactions are limited to Kubernetes API endpoints. The regex transformations are typical for resource kind formatting. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score of approximately 0.2 reflects operational risks associated with deploying untrusted YAML files, not inherent code flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Kubernetes resource management utility with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score is appropriate, considering operational risks but not code flaws. The provided reports are consistent and accurate.",
