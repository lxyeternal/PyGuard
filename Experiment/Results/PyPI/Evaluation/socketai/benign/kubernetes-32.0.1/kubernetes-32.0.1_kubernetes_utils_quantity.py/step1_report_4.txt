{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for parsing and formatting Kubernetes resource quantity strings, supporting SI suffixes and base1024 units.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the parameters 'quantity', 'suffix', and 'quantize' in the functions 'parse_quantity' and 'format_quantity'.",
  "sinks": "The functions return Decimal objects or formatted strings, which could potentially be used in further system commands or API calls, but no direct system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into Decimal numbers ('parse_quantity'), and Decimal numbers are formatted back into strings with suffixes ('format_quantity'). No external or untrusted data sources or sinks are explicitly invoked beyond function parameters.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flows. The code appears straightforward, with validation on suffixes and numeric parsing, but no signs of obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs parsing and formatting of Kubernetes resource quantities, with support for both SI and binary units. It validates suffixes and numeric formats, raising exceptions on invalid inputs. No external system calls, network activity, or sensitive data handling are present. The logic is simple and well-contained, serving a utility purpose. The validation of suffixes and conversion logic is appropriate and does not raise security concerns. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration or backdoors, is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for handling Kubernetes resource quantities. It performs input validation, numeric conversions, and string formatting without any suspicious or malicious activity. It does not appear to be compromised or malicious.",
