{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions to parse and format Kubernetes resource quantity strings, converting between human-readable format and decimal representation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'quantity' parameter of 'parse_quantity' and 'format_quantity' functions, which are expected to be strings or numeric types.",
  "sinks": "The functions perform arithmetic operations on the input data, returning Decimal objects or strings, with no direct data leakage or untrusted data effects.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into Decimal values ('parse_quantity') and formatted back into strings with suffixes ('format_quantity'). No external system calls or network operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obfuscated code patterns, dynamic code execution, or suspicious variable names. The functions are straightforward utility functions with no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly handles parsing and formatting of Kubernetes resource quantities, supporting standard SI and binary suffixes. It performs input validation and converts between string and Decimal formats. There are no code injection risks, no data exfiltration mechanisms, and no external dependencies beyond standard Python modules. The functions include validation to prevent invalid suffixes or number formats. No malicious behavior or backdoors are detected. The code's structure is simple, transparent, and serves a specific utility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for handling Kubernetes resource quantities, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs straightforward parsing and formatting operations with appropriate input validation. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present.",
