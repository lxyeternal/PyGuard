{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to parse and format Kubernetes resource quantity strings, converting them between human-readable and decimal forms.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the 'quantity' parameter in parse_quantity and quantity_value in format_quantity, which are strings or numbers provided by users or other modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include returning Decimal objects or strings, which could be used elsewhere in the application. No direct data leakage or system modification occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (source) through parsing or formatting functions, resulting in Decimal or string outputs, with no external system interactions or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no obfuscated or unusual code constructs. It does not include hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No dynamically executed code or insecure practices are evident.",
  "analysis": "The module strictly handles parsing and formatting of Kubernetes resource quantities, utilizing safe Decimal arithmetic and string manipulation. It validates suffixes and number formats carefully, raising exceptions on invalid input. No external system calls, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are present. The functions perform simple data transformations without side effects or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for handling resource quantities in Kubernetes. It exhibits no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates within expected bounds for such a utility, with proper input validation and no external interactions.",
