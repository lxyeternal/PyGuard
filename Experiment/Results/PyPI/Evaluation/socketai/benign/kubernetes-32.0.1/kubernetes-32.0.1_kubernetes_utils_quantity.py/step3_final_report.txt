  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing and formatting Kubernetes resource quantities supporting SI and binary suffixes.",
  "sources": "Input strings representing resource quantities (e.g., '200Mi', '1G'), and decimal values for formatting.",
  "sinks": "Conversion outputs; no external data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into Decimal numbers; Decimal numbers are formatted back into strings with suffixes.",
  "anomalies": "Explicit check 'if suffix == \"ki\"' raises an error, which is inconsistent with support for 'Ki' suffixes; case sensitivity may cause unexpected validation failures.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward, well-documented utility functions with proper validation and error handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external dependencies. The suffix validation is mostly correct, but the special check for 'ki' appears unnecessary or potentially inconsistent, as 'Ki' is a valid suffix in Kubernetes resource quantities. The functions do not perform any external actions or data exfiltration. The validation logic effectively prevents malformed inputs. Overall, the code is safe, standard, and aligns with best practices for resource quantity handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility for Kubernetes resource quantity parsing and formatting. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The only minor logical inconsistency is the explicit check for 'ki', which does not impact security but could be clarified or removed for correctness. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.1 due to minimal inherent risk from input validation.",
