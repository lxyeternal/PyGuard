{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to parse and format Kubernetes resource quantity strings, supporting SI suffixes and conversions between different units.",
  "sources": "Input strings to parse_quantity and format_quantity functions, which come from external data sources such as Kubernetes resource specifications.",
  "sinks": "Returns of parse_quantity and format_quantity functions, which produce Decimal or string outputs that could be used elsewhere in Kubernetes configurations or APIs.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into parse_quantity or format_quantity, gets processed through numerical conversions, and results are returned as Decimal or formatted string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or backdoors. The code strictly handles numeric conversions with suffix parsing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for handling Kubernetes resource quantities: parse_quantity converts string inputs with SI suffixes into Decimal numbers; format_quantity converts Decimal values back into Kubernetes string format with specified suffix. The suffix handling is explicit and well-documented, with no evidence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. It correctly raises errors on unknown suffixes and handles edge cases. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, security-focused, and designed for resource quantity parsing and formatting.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate resource quantity parsing and formatting for Kubernetes configurations. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware indicators. The implementation is clear and focused solely on numerical conversions, with appropriate error handling. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
