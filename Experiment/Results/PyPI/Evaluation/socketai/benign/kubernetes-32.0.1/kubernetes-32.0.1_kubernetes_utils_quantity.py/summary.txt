  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility for Kubernetes resource quantity parsing and formatting. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The only minor logical inconsistency is the explicit check for 'ki', which does not impact security but could be clarified or removed for correctness. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score should be around 0.1 due to minimal inherent risk from input validation."
