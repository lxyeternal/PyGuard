{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse and format Kubernetes resource quantity strings, converting between string representations and Decimal objects for computational purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters: 'quantity' (string or number input) and 'suffix' (string), as well as the 'quantize' parameter for formatting.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs strings representing quantities, or Decimal objects during calculations, but it does not perform untrusted data flows to external systems or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'quantity' is converted to Decimal, potentially raising exceptions if malformed. The parsed Decimal is then used for calculations, and formatted back into strings with specified suffixes. No external network or file I/O occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or obfuscation are present. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors. The code performs straightforward parsing and formatting of numeric data with suffix handling.",
  "analysis": "The code contains functions for parsing Kubernetes resource quantities and formatting Decimal values back into strings with SI suffixes. It validates suffixes and numeric formats, raising ValueError for invalid input. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The logic is limited to numeric conversions, with no external interactions or sensitive data handling beyond input validation and mathematical operations. The inclusion of a mapping for suffix exponents and explicit validation helps prevent injection or exploitation via malformed inputs. Overall, the code appears purely functional and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for handling resource quantity conversions in Kubernetes contexts. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. Its security risk is minimal, and there are no signs of malware or covert operations. The code is well-structured, with appropriate validation and exception handling.",
