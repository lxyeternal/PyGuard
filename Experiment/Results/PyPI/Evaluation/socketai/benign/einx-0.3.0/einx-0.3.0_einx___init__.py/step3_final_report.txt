  "purpose": "The code consists solely of import statements for internal modules and functions within a Python package, likely part of a package's __init__.py or setup script.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading internal modules and functions from the package directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "N/A – the code only imports modules; no data flow or external data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of import statements, typical for package initialization. There is no dynamic code execution, external communication, or suspicious activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of internal module imports. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
