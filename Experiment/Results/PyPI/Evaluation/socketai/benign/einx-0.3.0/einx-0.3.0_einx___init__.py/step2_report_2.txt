  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential concerns.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports identify the code as purely import statements, with no data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are mentioned.\n- The confidence scores are all high (1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The malware scores are all zero, indicating no malicious activity is suspected.\n- The security risk scores are also zero, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is a standard set of import statements, typical for a package's `__init__.py` or setup script.\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are identified; the code appears benign and standard.\n- **Malware, obfuscation, risk scores:** All are set to 0, which is appropriate given the context.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are consistent in their assessments.\n- The high confidence and zero malware scores are justified.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are based on assumptions; the code is purely import statements.\n\n### Potential points of concern:\n- Since the code only contains imports, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n- The scores are reasonable and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent.** The code is benign, standard package setup code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a typical module import setup with no security concerns.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- No further action required based on this review.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current scores; the code is safe.",
