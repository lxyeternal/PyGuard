  "purpose": "Utility functions for recursive mapping and flattening of nested data structures (lists, tuples, dicts).",
  "sources": "None of the functions read external input or data; they operate on input parameters provided during invocation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; the functions process data structures but do not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "Input data structures flow through recursive calls, but there are no external data flows or network communications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The functions are straightforward recursive utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to recursively map functions over nested data structures and to flatten such structures. It handles lists, tuples, and dicts systematically, with options to specify leaf conditions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network operations, data exfiltration, or code injection. The implementation appears to be standard for nested data processing. No obfuscation, suspicious variables, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of utility functions for handling nested Python data structures, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical recursive operations without any suspicious behaviors.",
