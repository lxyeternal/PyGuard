  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for nested data structures, no external input/output, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — reasonable, given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is standard recursive utilities with no signs of malicious behavior. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions, noting that 'func' could process untrusted data but no malicious code is present.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, acknowledging that 'func' could process untrusted data, but the functions themselves are benign.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is sound. The low security risk score is justified, given that 'func' is user-defined and could be malicious if supplied malicious code, but the utility functions themselves are safe. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for nested data processing, no external data flows or malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — matches the benign analysis.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The functions are standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recursive traversal functions, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The functions are straightforward.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Recursive utilities, no external data leakage, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher but still low; acknowledges potential risks if 'func' is malicious.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. The slight increase in security risk score reflects the fact that 'func' could process malicious data, but the utility functions themselves are safe.\n\n---\n\n### Overall observations:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is present and correctly implemented.\n- **Malware:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very low; mainly depends on the user-supplied 'func'.\n- **Scores:** All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores for the entire code:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — the code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, straightforward implementation.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, considering 'func' could be malicious if supplied by an attacker, but the utility functions are safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a set of safe, standard recursive utilities for nested data structures. The existing reports are accurate and do not require adjustments.",
