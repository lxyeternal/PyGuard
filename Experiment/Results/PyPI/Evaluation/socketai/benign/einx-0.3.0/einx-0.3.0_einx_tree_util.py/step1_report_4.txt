  "purpose": "Utility functions for recursive tree mapping and flattening structures such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries, with optional leaf condition checks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (func, *trees, key, is_leaf) and the data structures passed to tree_map_with_key, tree_map, and tree_flatten.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of 'func' on leaf nodes; no external data sinks are directly visible.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through recursive calls to functions, ultimately applying 'func' at leaf nodes; no external or network interactions are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs recursive traversal with flexible data structures; no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution detected. No dynamic code evaluation or external data processing observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three main functions: 'tree_map_with_key', 'tree_map', and 'tree_flatten'. These functions perform recursive traversal of nested data structures, applying a provided function ('func') to leaf elements, with optional handling via 'is_leaf' condition. The traversal logic carefully handles lists, tuples, and dictionaries, preserving structure, and correctly passes a 'key' tuple for 'tree_map_with_key'. The code appears clean, well-structured, and purpose-specific, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data leakage mechanisms. The recursive pattern is standard for such data transformations and does not involve dynamic code execution or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, utility functions for recursive traversal and mapping over nested data structures. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are detected. The implementation is straightforward and focused on data structure manipulation.",
