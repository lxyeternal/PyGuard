  "purpose": "Utility functions for recursive traversal and mapping over nested data structures (lists, tuples, dicts).",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'trees' and 'x', and the 'func' and 'is_leaf' callback functions.",
  "sinks": "The 'func' and 'is_leaf' functions, which could process untrusted data if supplied externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'trees' or 'x' through recursive calls, invoking 'func' or 'is_leaf' at leaves or base cases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward recursive utility functions with clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard recursive traversal functions: 'tree_map_with_key', 'tree_map', and 'tree_flatten'. They operate on nested data structures, applying user-defined functions at leaves or specific nodes. The functions do not contain obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The only potential concern is that 'func' and 'is_leaf' are external callbacks that could be malicious if supplied by an attacker, but this is outside static code analysis scope. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign, and standard for nested data processing. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The slight security risk score (around 0.1) reflects the potential misuse of user-supplied functions, but the code itself is secure.",
