{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for recursively applying functions and flattening nested data structures such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through function parameters (func, *trees, key, is_leaf) and iterates over data structures (lists, tuples, dicts).",
  "sinks": "The functions apply user-provided functions (func) to data, but there are no direct data sinks that send data externally or to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input data structures are traversed and transformed via recursive calls, applying user functions at leaf nodes or specified conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or unusual dynamic execution are present. The functions perform standard recursive tree processing.",
  "analysis": "The code implements recursive traversal and mapping over nested data structures. It checks data types and applies user-supplied functions at leaves or specific nodes, preserving structure. There is no evidence of code injection, network activity, or malicious payloads. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are detected. Functions are designed for utility and safety, relying on user functions for processing. The code appears benign and standard for data structure manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides safe, standard utility functions for recursive data structure processing without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain hidden backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code. Overall, it appears to be benign, with a low malware score.",
