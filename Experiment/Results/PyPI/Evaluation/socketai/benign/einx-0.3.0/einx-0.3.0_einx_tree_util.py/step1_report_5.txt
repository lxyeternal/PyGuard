  "purpose": "Utility functions for recursive traversal and mapping over nested data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as 'func', 'trees', and 'x'. Usage of 'is_leaf' callback for custom leaf detection.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'func' with potentially untrusted data; iteration over data structures; no direct data output or network operations observed.",
  "flows": "Data is read from input parameters and passed through recursive mapping functions; no external data flows or outputs are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code uses standard recursion and data traversal patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions: 'tree_map_with_key', 'tree_map', and 'tree_flatten'. All functions perform recursive traversal over nested data structures, applying user-provided functions at leaf nodes or entire structures. The implementation is straightforward, employing standard Python constructs and type checks. No dynamic execution, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The 'is_leaf' callback allows customizable leaf detection but is used securely. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe utility functions for recursive data structure processing. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The code appears benign and well-structured for its intended purpose.",
