{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for Tensor and Backend, likely for use in machine learning or numerical computations.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present as the code only defines type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'TypeVar' from 'typing' to create a type alias 'Tensor' and imports 'einx' to define 'Backend' as 'einx.backend.Backend'. The code appears to be setting up type annotations or interfaces for later use in a larger codebase. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic execution, no obfuscated code, and no malicious constructs present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup of type aliases for use in a larger application, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
