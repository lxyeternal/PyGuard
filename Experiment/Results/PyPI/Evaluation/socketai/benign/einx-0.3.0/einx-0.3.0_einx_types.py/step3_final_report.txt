  "purpose": "Define type aliases for tensors and backend using minimal imports.",
  "sources": "Importing 'TypeVar' from 'typing' and 'einx' module; defining 'Tensor' as a TypeVar; assigning 'Backend' from 'einx.backend.Backend'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow from input to output or network.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> TypeVar assignment -> Backend attribute assignment; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing standard modules, defining type aliases, and assigning a class attribute. No dynamic execution, input handling, or network activity is present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a minimal setup for type annotations in a larger project. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores should reflect this low threat level.",
