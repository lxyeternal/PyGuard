{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for tensors and backend in a machine learning or numerical computation context.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'typing' and 'einx' modules; variable assignments for type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted input or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only defines type variables and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward type aliasing and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'TypeVar' function from the 'typing' module and the 'einx' library. It defines a type variable 'Tensor' and assigns 'Backend' from 'einx.backend.Backend'. There is no data processing, no input handling, and no dynamic execution. The code appears to set up types for further use in a larger context. It is minimal and standard, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple setup of type aliases for a machine learning framework or numerical library. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or security issues. It appears safe and benign.",
