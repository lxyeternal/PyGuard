  "purpose": "Define type variable 'Tensor' and import 'einx' library for tensor operations.",
  "sources": "Import statements and type variable declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only declares types and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'einx' library and defines a type variable 'Tensor'. The import of 'einx' suggests usage of a third-party tensor library, but the code provided does not perform any data processing, input handling, or network operations. No potential attack vectors or malicious behaviors are evident in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple type declaration and import statement with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not perform any operations that could be malicious or compromise security.",
