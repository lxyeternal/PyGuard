  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output points",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code only defines types and imports",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a library (einx) and defines type aliases. There are no dynamic code executions, data processing, or network interactions. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The code is minimal, focusing solely on type definitions and imports, which are common in modular Python codebases.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple setup for type annotations and library usage. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
