  "purpose": "Define type aliases for Tensor and Backend using type variables and import einx module.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'typing' and 'einx', assignment of TypeVar and module attributes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; code solely defines type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a third-party library, then defines type aliases without performing any data processing, input/output, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be straightforward type aliasing for later use. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign type alias definition with no malicious intent or security risks.",
