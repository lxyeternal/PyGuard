  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'einx' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or user input; setup parameters are static and controlled.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content flows into 'long_description' used in setup().",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behaviors. All code appears standard for a setup.py script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions from setuptools, reads a README file for the package description, and defines package metadata and dependencies. There are no indications of malicious behavior; it follows common packaging practices. No external input or untrusted data sources are used at runtime. No suspicious code, obfuscated segments, or hidden instructions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py configuration script for Python packaging. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
