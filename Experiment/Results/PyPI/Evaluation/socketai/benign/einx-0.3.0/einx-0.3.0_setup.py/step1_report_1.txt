  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'einx' with its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; static strings for package metadata; imported modules 'setuptools' and 'find_packages'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input handling or data sinks present; no network or file output beyond static configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A, as all data is statically assigned or read from a trusted file at setup time.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected. Usage of standard setup script practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary setup tools, reads a markdown file for long description, and calls 'setup()' with static metadata and dependencies. There is no dynamic code execution, user input, or untrusted data handling. The dependencies are clearly specified, and there are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The script appears to be a standard Python package setup script with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup configuration for packaging a Python project. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
