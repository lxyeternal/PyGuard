{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'einx', used for packaging and distributing the library.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, and configuration parameters for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified; setup configuration is standard and does not process untrusted input at runtime.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the script reads a file for metadata and calls setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code present. All dependencies are standard Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup functions, reads a README file, and executes a standard setup() call with static parameters. No dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to be a typical package setup script, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
