{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package named 'einx' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; static metadata and dependency lists in the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data; no code execution or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Reads file content to assign to long_description, then passes static data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs static configuration of package metadata with no external input processing or dynamic code execution. It loads a file, assigns its content to a variable, and calls setup() with fixed arguments. No network operations, no code injection, and no obfuscated or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging Python code and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
