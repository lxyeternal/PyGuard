{
  "purpose": "This is a standard Python setup script for packaging a project named 'einx', reading a README.md for long description and specifying dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long_description; static strings for package info and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static configuration with no external data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, well-formed setup script with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools, with static metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads a README file for documentation and defines dependencies explicitly. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. All dependencies are standard packages. The code structure and content are consistent with benign package configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, standard, and free of malicious or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1—are accurate and justified based on the code analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
