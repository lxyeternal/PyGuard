{
  "purpose": "This code defines a logging module for dbt-osmosis, providing functions to create and configure loggers with rotating file handlers and rich console output.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from configuration parameters such as logger name, level, path, and formatter. It also accesses environment variables indirectly through Path.home().",
  "sinks": "The code writes log data to files in the user's home directory and outputs logs to the console. No untrusted data is sent over the network or written to system files outside the intended logs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (name, level, path, formatter) are used to configure loggers and handlers. These loggers then process log messages, which are directed to log files and the console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Usage of rich and logging libraries appears standard. The log file paths and handlers are straightforward. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logging system with rotating file handlers and console output using RichHandler. It employs standard Python libraries and best practices for logging. The get_logger function caches loggers to avoid repeated configuration. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior is evident. The code does not handle or process untrusted inputs beyond logging, nor does it send data externally. All operations are typical for a logging utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup for a Python application with no malicious intent. It efficiently manages loggers and outputs, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
