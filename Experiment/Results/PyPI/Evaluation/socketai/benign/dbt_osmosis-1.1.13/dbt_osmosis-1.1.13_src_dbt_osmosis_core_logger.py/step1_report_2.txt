{
  "purpose": "This code defines a logging module for the dbt-osmosis project, setting up loggers with file rotation and rich console output.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters for log level, file paths, and formatter strings. It also reads environment variables indirectly through Path.home().",
  "sinks": "Log messages are sent to rotating log files in ~/.dbt-osmosis/logs and to the console via RichHandler.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters flow into get_logger(), which creates and returns a logger that sends output to files and console. Log messages generated via the logger's methods are handled by the RichHandler and file handler.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. Usage of rich.console.Console(stderr=True) appears standard. The code uses LRU cache for loggers, which is normal. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present. No network activity or data exfiltration is detected. No unusual or malicious logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The module provides a standard logging setup with file rotation and rich console output. It caches loggers to avoid re-creation. The code uses standard Python logging practices, path handling, and third-party libraries in a benign manner. No signs of malicious behavior such as hidden network activity, backdoors, data leaks, or code injection are evident. The code primarily deals with configuration and output formatting. The environment variable Path.home() is used to determine log storage location, which is typical. No secrets or credentials are embedded. The use of __getattr__ to proxy logger methods is standard for dynamic attribute access. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate logging utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured logging setup for a Python application. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected. It functions as intended for logging purposes without security concerns.",
