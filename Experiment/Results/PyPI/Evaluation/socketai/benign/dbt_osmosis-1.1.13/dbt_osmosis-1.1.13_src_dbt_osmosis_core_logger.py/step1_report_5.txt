{
  "purpose": "The code defines a logging setup for the dbt-osmosis project, configuring a logger with rotating file handlers and rich console output, and exposes logger methods via dynamic attribute access.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters (name, level, path, formatter) for loggers, and creates log files in the user's home directory under .dbt-osmosis/logs.",
  "sinks": "Logging output is directed to log files and the console via RichHandler. No untrusted data is directly sent over the network or used in sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Configuration inputs flow into get_logger(), which constructs and caches a logger. Logging methods invoked via __getattr__ are forwarded to the LOGGER instance, which writes to log files and console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors present. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. Logging configurations and handler setups are standard. No unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a standard logging framework with rotating file handlers and console output, using well-known Python libraries. The use of get_logger() with caching is typical. No data leakage, malicious behavior, or suspicious data handling observed. The dynamic __getattr__ method exposes logger methods, which is standard for proxy objects. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logging setup for a Python application, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It manages log files securely within the user's home directory and provides standard logging functionalities.",
