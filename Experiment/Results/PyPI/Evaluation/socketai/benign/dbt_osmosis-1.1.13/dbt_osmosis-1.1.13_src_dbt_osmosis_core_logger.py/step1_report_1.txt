{
  "purpose": "The code provides a logging utility for the dbt-osmosis project, setting up rotating file handlers and rich console output for logs.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters such as logger name, level, path, and formatter, mostly from function arguments and module-level constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data directly. Logging outputs are written to local files and console, with no network communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves creating log handlers and a logger instance, caching logger objects, and providing dynamic attribute access to logger methods. Data flows from input parameters to logger configuration and output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The logging functions are standard, and the use of rich for console output is typical. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a robust logging setup with file rotation and console output. It employs standard libraries and practices, including caching for efficiency. No suspicious external calls, network activity, or data leaks are detected. The protocol for logger methods is conventional. All parts appear to serve legitimate logging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured logging utility with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It safely manages logs for the application without any suspicious activity.",
