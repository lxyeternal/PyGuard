{
  "purpose": "This module configures and provides a logging system for the dbt-osmosis application, enabling logs to be written to rotating files and displayed with rich formatting in the console.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters such as logger name, level, path, and formatter, primarily from function arguments and module-level constants.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to files in the user's home directory (~/.dbt-osmosis/logs) and console via RichHandler; no untrusted data handling beyond standard logging.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters are used to set up loggers and handlers, which then output logs to files and console based on log levels and formats.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; standard logging setup with no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. No network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a logging system with rotating file handlers and console output, utilizing standard Python logging practices. It employs cache for logger instances, and the handler configuration appears routine. No code injection, malicious data flows, or suspicious activities identified. The use of rich for formatted console logs and rotating logs is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or anomalous patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical logging setup for an application with no indicators of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. It responsibly manages log files and provides rich console output, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
