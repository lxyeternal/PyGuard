{
  "purpose": "The code provides a logging utility for dbt-osmosis, configuring rotating file handlers and rich console output, proxying logger methods via __getattr__.",
  "sources": "Path.home() for log directory, function arguments for configuration, standard logging and rich libraries for output.",
  "sinks": "Logs written to local files in ~/.dbt-osmosis/logs and to console; no external network activity.",
  "flows": "Logger methods called -> get_logger returns logger -> handlers process logs -> logs stored locally and displayed on console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured logging setup utilizing standard Python libraries. It writes logs to local files with rotation and outputs to console with rich formatting. No external network activity, malicious code, or obfuscation is present. The use of Path.home() is standard for user-specific log storage. The __getattr__ proxy simply forwards method calls to the logger instance, which is a common pattern. All security signals are benign; no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
