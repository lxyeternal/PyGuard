{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or utility functions, but the specific intent is unclear without more context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the standard input (e.g., input() function) or external files, depending on the code segments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (e.g., socket or requests library usage), file writes, or execution functions that could be misused.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions towards sinks such as network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. However, some parts may use dynamic imports or eval-like functions which require scrutiny.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python functions and third-party libraries without clear signs of malicious behavior. No hard-coded secrets or backdoors are evident. The structure suggests normal utility code, but incomplete or obfuscated sections (if any) need further review. The use of potentially risky functions like eval or exec is not apparent. The absence of network activity or data exfiltration indicators limits suspicion. The code appears legitimate, with no embedded malware signals.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no significant signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign utility code with no evident malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks.",
