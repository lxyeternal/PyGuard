{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a basic utility script for performing some operations, possibly involving user input and data processing.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from the user via input functions, reads environment variables, and imports external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls (if present), file writes, or subprocess executions, which are not explicitly shown in the fragment but should be checked in the complete code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input and environment variables to processing functions, possibly leading to outputs or network connections.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. Unusual patterns like dynamic code execution or misleading variable names are absent from the visible fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and possibly some third-party packages. It reads input and environment variables but does not show any suspicious activity such as executing untrusted code, network connections, or data exfiltration. Without further context or hidden code, the code appears benign. Care should be taken to review the complete code for hidden or conditional malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The code seems standard and does not exhibit obvious security risks.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
