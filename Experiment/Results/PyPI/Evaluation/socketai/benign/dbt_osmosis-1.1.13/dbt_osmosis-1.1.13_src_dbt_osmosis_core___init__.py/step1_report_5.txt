  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a utility or module for general use, potentially involving data processing or system interaction. Without specific comments or documentation, the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external files or network sources if present (not explicitly visible).",
  "sinks": "Data can be sent over network connections, written to files, or used in system commands if such functions are present, though none are explicitly identified in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through functions and potentially to sinks like network calls, file writes, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are apparent. The code does not show obfuscation, unusual variable naming, or misleading constructs. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly at all sections. It does not contain obfuscated parts, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate. No signs of data leakage, insecure practices, or malware-like activities are present. The code structure and style are straightforward, and no anomalies indicating sabotage are found.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign and does not pose any immediate security threat.",
