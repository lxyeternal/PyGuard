  "purpose": "Render a feed interface within a dashboard using Streamlit and custom UI components.",
  "sources": "session_state for feed_html, extras.InnerHTML for injecting HTML content.",
  "sinks": "extras.InnerHTML renders HTML content directly into the DOM, which could be a sink for untrusted input.",
  "flows": "session_state['app']['feed_html'] → extras.InnerHTML rendering",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. Usage of inner HTML suggests potential for rendering untrusted content, but this is context-dependent and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dashboard item that displays a news feed. It uses session state to store HTML content and renders it directly via extras.InnerHTML. The code structure appears typical for a Streamlit-based application with custom UI components. The potential security concern lies in rendering HTML directly, which could be exploited if feed_html contains malicious code. However, this depends on the source of feed_html, which is not shown here. No other suspicious or malicious activities, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for rendering a news feed within a dashboard. Its security risk depends on how feed_html is populated. No malicious behavior or malware is evident in this fragment. The primary concern is safe handling of the HTML content to prevent XSS if feed_html is untrusted.",
