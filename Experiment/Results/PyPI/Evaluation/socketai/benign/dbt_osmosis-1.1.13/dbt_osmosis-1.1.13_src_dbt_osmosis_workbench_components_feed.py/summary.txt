  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign but poses a security risk of XSS if feed_html is untrusted. The malware and obfuscation scores are correct. The risk score should be around 0.4 to accurately reflect the potential for malicious content injection. All reports correctly identify the core issue; minor score adjustments are recommended to reflect the risk more accurately."
