{
  "purpose": "Render a Streamlit dashboard item displaying an RSS feed with dynamic HTML content.",
  "sources": "Reads 'feed_html' from session state; receives props for rendering.",
  "sinks": "Uses extras.InnerHTML to inject HTML content into the page.",
  "flows": "Session state 'feed_html' -> extras.InnerHTML for rendering.",
  "anomalies": "Direct injection of HTML via extras.InnerHTML; no sanitization or validation shown; potential for XSS if 'feed_html' is user-controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for displaying an RSS feed within a Streamlit app, rendering HTML content stored in session state. The use of extras.InnerHTML to insert HTML directly into the page could be exploited if 'feed_html' is populated with malicious code, especially if it is derived from untrusted sources without sanitization. No evident input validation or sanitization is present, which raises concern about potential cross-site scripting (XSS). The code structure and import statements are standard and do not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns. The overall security risk hinges on the trustworthiness of the 'feed_html' data.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary risk is the direct rendering of HTML content from session state without sanitization, which could lead to XSS attacks if 'feed_html' is compromised or maliciously crafted. No other malicious behavior or suspicious patterns are detected.",
