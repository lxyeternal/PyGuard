  "purpose": "Render a user interface component for displaying an RSS feed within a Streamlit dashboard.",
  "sources": "Code reads from 'streamlit.session_state' (state.app.feed_html) which contains HTML content to be rendered.",
  "targets": "InnerHTML function potentially injects HTML into the page, which could be malicious if feed_html contains untrusted content.",
  "flows": "session_state.app.feed_html (source) -> extras.InnerHTML (sink) which renders HTML content.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'extras.InnerHTML' to inject raw HTML without sanitization; the feed_html source is external and could contain malicious content. No input validation or sanitization shown.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that creates a UI component to display an RSS feed using HTML content stored in the session state. The feed_html is directly injected into the DOM via 'extras.InnerHTML' without sanitization, which could pose a risk if feed_html contains malicious scripts or content. The code itself does not perform network activity, credential handling, or system modifications. It relies on external data (feed_html) which, if compromised, could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The code structure appears straightforward and uses standard libraries; no obfuscated or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a UI component rendering external HTML content. The main concern is the direct injection of potentially untrusted HTML into the page via 'extras.InnerHTML', which could lead to cross-site scripting if feed_html is maliciously crafted. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident, but the lack of sanitization presents a security risk.",
