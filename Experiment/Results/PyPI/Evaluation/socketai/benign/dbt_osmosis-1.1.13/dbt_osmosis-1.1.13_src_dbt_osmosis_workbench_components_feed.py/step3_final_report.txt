  "purpose": "Render an RSS feed in a Streamlit dashboard by injecting HTML content stored in session state.",
  "sources": "session_state.app.feed_html (external HTML content)",

  "flows": "session_state.app.feed_html -> extras.InnerHTML",
  "anomalies": "Direct injection of untrusted HTML without sanitization, potential for XSS if feed_html is malicious",
  "analysis": "The code injects HTML directly into the UI via extras.InnerHTML without sanitization, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if feed_html is untrusted. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate. The security risk score varies from 0.2 to 0.4, reflecting moderate concern about XSS depending on trust in feed_html. Confidence levels are high, as the code is straightforward. The main vulnerability is the lack of sanitization, which could be mitigated by sanitizing feed_html before rendering.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is benign but poses a security risk of XSS if feed_html is untrusted. The malware and obfuscation scores are correct. The risk score should be around 0.4 to accurately reflect the potential for malicious content injection. All reports correctly identify the core issue; minor score adjustments are recommended to reflect the risk more accurately.",
