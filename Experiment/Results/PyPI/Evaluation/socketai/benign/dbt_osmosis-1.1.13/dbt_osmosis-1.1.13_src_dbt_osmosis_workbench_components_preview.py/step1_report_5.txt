{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Streamlit-based UI component for previewing query results within a dashboard, allowing users to run queries and view results or errors.",
  "sources": "User-triggered actions such as clicking the 'Run Query' button, reading from the global 'state' object for query status and results.",
  "sinks": "Rendering functions displaying data, error messages, or progress indicators; potential data leak if sensitive info is exposed in query results or status messages.",
  "flows": "User triggers 'self._query_action()', which presumably executes a query; query status and results flow from 'state.app' into UI components for display.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution. Usage of JSCallback with a random ID generator is standard for dynamic row IDs, not malicious. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward UI component for query preview with standard patterns: using Streamlit, MUI components, and callbacks. No signs of malicious code or sabotage; it handles user input, displays query results, and manages query states securely. No external suspicious connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign UI component for a dashboard application, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
