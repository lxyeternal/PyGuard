{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Streamlit-based user interface component for displaying query results and controlling query execution within a dashboard.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include session state variables (query_state, query_result_columns, query_result_rows, query_adapter_resp), and user interactions such as button clicks.",
  "sinks": "The code executes a query action via a callback, displays data in a DataGrid, and formats output messages. The only dynamic content is derived from trusted application state variables.",
  "flows": "User interaction (clicking 'Run Query') triggers self._query_action(); session state variables provide data for rendering; no direct untrusted data flows or command executions observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The use of getRowId with JSCallback generates random IDs but does not pose security risks. No malicious code or privacy violations are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard UI component for displaying query results. It references session state for data display, uses standard streamlit and mui components, and includes a straightforward callback for running queries. No external data sources or insecure behaviors are evident. The only dynamic function is getRowId, which uses a safe JavaScript expression to generate IDs, not affecting security. No hardcoded secrets or malicious actions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign user interface component with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. It responsibly handles data display and user interactions without performing any unsafe operations.",
