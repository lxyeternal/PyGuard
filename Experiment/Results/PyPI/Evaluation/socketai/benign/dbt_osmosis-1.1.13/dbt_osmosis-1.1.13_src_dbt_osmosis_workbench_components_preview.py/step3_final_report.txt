{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Streamlit UI component for previewing query results, handling different query states (loading, error, success), and providing a button to trigger query execution.",
  "sources": "Reads from session_state variables (query_state, query_result_columns, query_result_rows, query_adapter_resp), and user interactions (button click). Uses JSCallback for generating row IDs.",
  "sinks": "The button triggers the query action; data is displayed in DataGrid; no external data leaks or network calls are evident.",
  "flows": "User clicks 'Run Query' button -> triggers self._query_action() -> updates session_state variables -> UI renders based on session_state values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of JSCallback('(row) => Math.random()') for getRowId is standard for unique row IDs; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward UI component with no malicious or obfuscated code. It manages UI states effectively, uses benign patterns, and does not perform any external network or file operations. The use of Math.random() for row IDs is typical and not security-sensitive. No vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, well-structured UI component with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The existing scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
