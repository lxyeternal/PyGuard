{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Streamlit UI component for previewing query results in a dashboard, allowing users to run queries and view results or errors.",
  "sources": "Reads user interactions (button clicks), and session state variables such as 'query_state', 'query_adapter_resp', 'query_result_df', 'query_result_columns', and 'query_result_rows'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'self._query_action()' which likely triggers a query operation; also renders UI elements based on session state. The code does not directly send or store untrusted data outside the application's scope.",
  "flows": "User clicks 'Run Query' button -> triggers 'self._query_action()' -> updates session state variables -> UI renders based on 'query_state' and result data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The use of 'JSCallback' with '(row) => Math.random()' is benign for generating unique row IDs; no suspicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages UI rendering and user interactions with session state variables. It includes safe usage of session variables and rendering logic. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The 'JSCallback' for row IDs is a common pattern and not malicious. No suspicious network activity or code injection mechanisms are present. The code adheres to standard patterns for a Streamlit app component.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard UI component for displaying query results in a dashboard with no malicious intent or security risks. It safely handles user interactions and session state. No indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security threats are detected.",
