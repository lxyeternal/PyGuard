{
  "purpose": "Invoke the command-line interface (CLI) for the 'dbt_osmosis' package with command-line arguments",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1:] (user input from command line)",
  "sinks": "cli() function execution, which may process the input arguments",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1:] -> cli() function",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to access command-line arguments and imports the 'cli' function from 'dbt_osmosis.cli.main'. When run as the main module, it passes all command-line arguments (excluding the script name) directly to the 'cli' function. There are no obfuscation techniques or suspicious behaviors such as network calls, data exfiltration, or hidden code. The code appears to be a straightforward entry point for a CLI application, delegating execution to the imported 'cli' function.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply forwards command-line arguments to a CLI handler. No anomalies or malware indicators are present.",
