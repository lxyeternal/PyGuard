{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point for executing a command-line interface (CLI) defined in the 'dbt_osmosis' package.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Passes untrusted command-line arguments to the 'cli' function, which may process them",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1:] → cli()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected. The import from 'dbt_osmosis' might be a third-party package, but its presence alone isn't suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys for accessing command-line arguments and the cli function from the dbt_osmosis package. When run as main, it forwards the command-line arguments (excluding the script name) to the cli() function. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is minimal and straightforward, mainly acting as a launcher for the cli functionality of the package.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI entry point with no evident malicious behavior. It relies on the 'dbt_osmosis' package's cli function, which is outside the scope of this snippet but appears to be a typical pattern for CLI tools.",
