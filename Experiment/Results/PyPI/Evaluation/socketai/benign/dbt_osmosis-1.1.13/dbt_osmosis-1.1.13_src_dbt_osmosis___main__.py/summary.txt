  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign CLI dispatcher that forwards user input to an external handler. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious activity within this fragment. The security posture depends on the implementation of 'cli()', which should be reviewed separately. Overall, the code is safe and straightforward, with low inherent risk."
