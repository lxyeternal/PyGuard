{
  "purpose": "To invoke the command-line interface (CLI) for the 'dbt_osmosis' package by passing command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1:] - the command-line arguments provided by the user (excluding the script name).",
  "sinks": "The call to cli(sys.argv[1:]) - potentially executing code based on user input, which could lead to security issues if not properly handled.",
  "flows": "User inputs via command line → sys.argv → cli() function call → execution of command logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code directly forwards command-line arguments to a CLI handler.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys for accessing command-line arguments and a cli function from a module. It runs the cli function with arguments passed by the user. No data validation, sanitization, or security checks are visible. The security risk depends on the implementation of cli(). If cli() properly sanitizes inputs, the risk is minimal. The code itself is minimal and straightforward, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wrapper that forwards command-line arguments to the cli handler. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities within this snippet; the security depends on the internal implementation of cli().",
