  "sources": "Places where code reads input or data",
  "sinks": "Places where untrusted data can lead to potential data leak or effect",
  "flows": "Source-to-sink paths",
  "anomalies": "Places where code does anything unusual",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK initialization module, performing imports, setting up logging, issuing benign version warnings, and defining module exports. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, external data inputs, or credential handling. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The version warnings are standard and do not pose security risks. Static analysis confirms no suspicious flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. Minor version warning conditions are routine and do not impact security.",
