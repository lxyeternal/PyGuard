{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an SDK for LeanCloud, providing import statements, configuration, and exposing various modules and functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Reading system information (sys.version_info), module imports, and attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present; the code mainly initializes and exposes modules.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up module metadata and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The warnings are standard compatibility notices. No obfuscated or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and internal components, sets up logging, version checks, and defines __all__ for module exports. No external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or sensitive operations are detected. The only noteworthy aspect is version warning messages, which are standard in SDK setups. The code appears to be a legitimate module initializer for the SDK without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical SDK setup module with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It only performs import, configuration, and metadata definitions, with no harmful or suspicious operations.",
