  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward SDK initialization module.\n- No suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The code mainly performs imports, sets up logging, and issues benign version warnings.\n- No external data inputs, network activity, or sensitive operations are present.\n- The version warnings are standard and not indicative of malicious intent.\n- The confidence levels are high, and malware, obfuscated code, and security risks are consistently rated as zero or very low.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of code:** The code is purely setup and import statements; no malicious or suspicious logic is present.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are evident from static analysis.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The only minor issue is a possible typo in the second report's version check:\n  - `if version_info.minor == 3 and version_info.minor < 4:` \n  - This condition is redundant and likely intended to be `if version_info.major == 3 and version_info.minor < 4:`. However, this is a benign mistake in the logic of version warnings, not a security flaw.\n- The warnings are standard and do not pose security risks.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is justified; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Additional Recommendations:\n- The minor typo in the version check should be corrected for clarity, but it does not impact security.\n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign SDK initialization module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, and no further security concerns are warranted based on static analysis.",
