{
  "purpose": "The code implements a User class for managing user authentication, authorization, and related operations in a client-server environment, including login, signup, token management, and third-party linking.",
  "sources": "Reads include user input (via method parameters), environment variables (indirectly through client calls), and server responses from API endpoints (/users/me, /login, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are network requests (client.get/post/put/delete), especially those transmitting sensitive data like session tokens, passwords, or authData, which could lead to data leaks if mishandled.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (e.g., username, password, phone number) to server requests, and responses update user state, especially session tokens and user info. Sensitive data, such as authData and session tokens, flow to and from server endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The only potential concern is the handling of session tokens and authData, but these are standard for auth systems. There is no indication of malicious behaviors like network exfiltration of user data, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a User class with typical authentication methods, including login, logout, session management, third-party linking, and password reset functionalities. The methods use network requests to communicate with backend API endpoints, handling user data securely by clearing sensitive attributes after operations. There are no signs of malicious code, such as hidden network connections, credential theft, or backdoors. All network communications seem standard for user auth workflows. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present. The flow of data appears appropriate and standard for client-side user management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard user management implementation for an API-based system without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It performs typical user operations securely, with no evidence of sabotage, malware, or malicious data exfiltration. The security risks are minimal and related to general auth handling, not due to malicious code.",
