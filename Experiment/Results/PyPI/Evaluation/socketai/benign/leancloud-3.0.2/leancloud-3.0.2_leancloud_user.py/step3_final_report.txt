{
  "purpose": "The code implements a user management class with methods for authentication, profile management, social interactions, and third-party integrations, communicating with a backend server via API calls.",
  "sources": "User input via method parameters, server responses from API calls (client object), session tokens, authData, and user attributes.",
  "sinks": "API endpoints handling login, signup, password reset, profile updates, social follow/unfollow, and third-party auth; sensitive data transmitted over network.",
  "flows": "User inputs (e.g., username, password, email) flow into API request parameters; server responses update local user object data; session tokens are used for authentication checks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or backdoors detected. Use of threading.local for current user state is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code follows typical SDK patterns for user management, with clear data flow and standard security practices. No malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies identified. API interactions are straightforward, and handling of session tokens and authData aligns with common implementations. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on server-side security. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard user management SDK with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is low, and the implementation appears secure and well-structured.",
