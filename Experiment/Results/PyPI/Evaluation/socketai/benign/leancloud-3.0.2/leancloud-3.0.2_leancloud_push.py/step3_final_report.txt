{
  "purpose": "This code manages push notifications by constructing request parameters, encoding times, fetching notification data, and posting notifications via an external API client.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as push_time, expiration_time, expiration_interval, where, cql, flow_control, prod, and data; external 'client' module for network requests.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to '/push' and '/tables/Notifications/{id}', data updates via self._update_data, creation of Notification objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assembled into 'params' dictionary, which is sent via client.post; fetch() retrieves data via client.get and updates object data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; reliance on external 'client' and 'leancloud' modules; potential misuse of 'where' and 'cql' if inputs are untrusted, but outside scope.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK component for push notifications, with proper validation to prevent conflicting expiration parameters. It encodes times safely, handles optional parameters correctly, and interacts with external modules in a standard manner. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The network interactions are typical API calls, and the code structure is clear and well-organized. External dependencies ('client', 'leancloud') are critical points but are outside the scope of this snippet. Overall, the code appears secure and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-implemented push notification SDK component with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The current scores—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2—are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
