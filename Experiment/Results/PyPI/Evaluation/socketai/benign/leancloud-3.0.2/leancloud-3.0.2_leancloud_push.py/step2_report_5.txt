  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code manages push notifications: sending and fetching data via network requests. The core functions (`send`, `fetch`, `_encode_time`) are straightforward, with no evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The code relies on an external `client` module for network operations, which is typical for SDKs.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports uniformly state that no malicious behavior or backdoors are detected. This is consistent with the code.  \n- They correctly note that the code does not execute dynamic code, access sensitive system data, or contain obfuscated segments.  \n- The only minor concern raised is the reliance on external inputs like `where` and `cql`, which could be misused if not validated at a higher level, but this is standard for SDKs and outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0.2`. These are reasonable given the analysis.  \n- The confidence levels are high (0.9), which aligns with the thorough review.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \n- None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate. The code appears safe, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities detected.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \n- All reports assign malware as 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior. No malicious activities are evident.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \n- The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They recognize that reliance on external inputs (`where`, `cql`) could pose risks if misused, but they correctly state that this depends on external validation.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report**  \n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the detailed analysis.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:  \n- The code is a standard SDK component for push notifications, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior.  \n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, given the evidence.  \n- The security risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging external input considerations.\n\n**My own estimate** after reviewing all reports:  \n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to external input handling, but no direct vulnerabilities)  \n\n**Final note:** The code appears safe and legitimate. No changes to the scores are necessary based on this review.",
