{
  "purpose": "This code implements a client SDK for interacting with the LeanCloud backend, including object creation, saving, deletion, querying, and relation management.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include object attributes, server responses, and user-supplied parameters such as class names and query conditions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are network requests via 'client.post', 'client.put', 'client.delete', and 'client.get', which send data to external servers; also, JSON serialization and dynamic attribute setting.",
  "flows": "Sources flow into object attribute setters and methods that trigger network requests; data flows from server responses into local object state updates.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are detected. The code uses standard libraries and well-structured method calls. No unusual dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SDK implementation for data persistence with methods for object lifecycle management. It uses network requests to interact with a remote server, with no apparent malicious logic. The flow from object attribute manipulation to server communication is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious external calls, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears clean and consistent with typical SDK patterns, with proper input validation and error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK for backend data management, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles data operations securely within expected patterns. No malicious intent is evident.",
