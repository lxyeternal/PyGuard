{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard SDK for managing cloud objects, including creation, saving, deletion, and relations, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage.",
  "sources": "Object attribute access, network request functions via 'client' module, data serialization/deserialization",
  "sinks": "Network requests to server endpoints, data returned from server, attribute setters",
  "flows": "User input or attribute modifications -> internal attribute updates -> network requests to save/delete objects -> server responses -> local data updates",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious data flows detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SDK implementation with clear structure, handling object attributes, network communication, and data serialization. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The network interactions are standard API calls, and no suspicious data exfiltration or backdoors are present. The code's logic aligns with expected SDK behavior, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured SDK for cloud object management, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The overall assessment confirms the code's benign nature.",
