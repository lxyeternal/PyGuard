  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The report states that the code is a typical SDK with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code review confirms no suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscated logic.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The reasoning is sound; the code is standard SDK code with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.  \n- **Justification:** The low risk score aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities. The malware score of 0 is justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to report 1, it emphasizes standard SDK behavior, network requests, and data serialization without malicious activity.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The reasoning is consistent; no malicious code or obfuscation is detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.  \n- **Justification:** The low risk and malware scores are justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Again, the code is a typical SDK for cloud object management, with no signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The analysis is thorough; no hidden malicious logic or vulnerabilities are apparent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.  \n- **Justification:** Consistent with the code's nature.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same conclusion—standard SDK code, no malicious activity, no obfuscation.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The analysis is comprehensive and accurate.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.  \n- **Justification:** Appropriate given the code.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Consistent with previous reports; the code is a typical SDK with no malicious or obfuscated elements.  \n- **Errors/flaws:** The reasoning is correct; no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.  \n- **Justification:** The scores are justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's nature. No malicious activity is evident.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, matching the straightforward, readable code.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 across all reports is reasonable, reflecting a low but non-zero general security risk typical of SDKs that perform network operations.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious code or behavior).  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected).  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard low-level risk associated with networked SDKs).\n\n**No evidence suggests higher scores are justified.** The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type | Final Estimate |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| Malware      | 0              |\n| Obfuscated   | 0              |\n| Security Risk| 0.2            |\n\nThe code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.",
