  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and ensure the scoring aligns with the content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical SDK for backend data management, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code appears clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, reflecting general SDK risk, which is reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** No issues found; the report's reasoning is sound.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's scores and reasoning are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on standard network interactions and no malicious indicators.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity; the reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are justified and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the SDK nature, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — acceptable.\n- **Assessment:** No issues; reasoning aligns with code content.\n\n**Conclusion:** The evaluation is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as previous, standard SDK with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — clear code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard SDK with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — acceptable.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:** The evaluation is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Uniformly 0.2, reflecting typical SDK risk, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — standard SDK risk, no elevated concerns.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and justified. No modifications needed. The code appears to be a standard, well-implemented SDK for cloud object management with no signs of supply chain threats or malicious behavior.",
