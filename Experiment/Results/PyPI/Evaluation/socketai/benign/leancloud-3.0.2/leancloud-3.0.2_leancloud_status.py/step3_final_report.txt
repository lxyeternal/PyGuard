{
  "purpose": "The code manages user statuses, including sending, updating, counting unread statuses, and querying statuses via external API calls, primarily for social or messaging features.",
  "sources": "Data is read from user input, current user context via User.get_current(), and server responses from API calls (client.post, client.get, client.delete).",
  "sinks": "External API endpoints (e.g., /statuses, /subscribe/statuses/count) where data is transmitted over the network, potentially exposing user data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user input and internal data structures into API request parameters, which are sent over the network; responses are received and processed to update internal state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard API client interactions and data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical SDK component for managing statuses, relying on external modules for API communication. It performs user validation, constructs request parameters, and processes responses. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The data flows are straightforward, and the code structure is clear. The security risk is low, primarily due to network communication, but this is expected for such SDKs. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK component for status management, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the code appears safe for use in production environments.",
