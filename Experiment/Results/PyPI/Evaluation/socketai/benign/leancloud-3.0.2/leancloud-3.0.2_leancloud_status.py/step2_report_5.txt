  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages statuses via API calls, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code interacts with external APIs using user data, but there's no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The data flows are standard, and no anomalies or obfuscation are detected.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe malware score of 0 is justified. The security risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, considering the reliance on external services, but no immediate vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with no suspicious or malicious code detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code's logic appears standard, with no signs of malware or malicious data handling. The reasoning aligns with the code's straightforward API interactions.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Manages statuses with standard API calls; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis correctly notes that the code is typical for such a client SDK, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Handles status data and user info, with no obvious malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is consistent; the code transmits user data over network calls, but this is standard for such SDKs and not inherently malicious.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard status management via Leancloud SDK, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is straightforward, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Scores:** 0.2 across all reports seems reasonable given the external API interactions, but no critical vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (standard for networked API clients, assuming backend security is sound)\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nThe code relies on external modules (`leancloud.client`, `utils`, etc.), but their usage appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The data flows are typical for such SDKs, and no suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nI concur with the provided scores. The code appears safe, with no malware or obfuscation, and a low security risk due to external API interactions, which are common in such SDKs.",
