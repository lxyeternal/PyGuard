  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as a status management system, correctly noting data flows from user input, current user context, and API responses.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies external API calls as sinks and data flow from user input to API requests.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The reasoning is sound; the code uses standard API interactions, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that the code is standard SDK code with no malware or security risks aligns with the analysis. Confidence at 0.9 is appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2 are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's logic and scoring are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code manages statuses, with data from user context and server responses.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes network API calls as sinks, with data flowing from user inputs to network requests.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious constructs or obfuscation. The analysis concludes standard API client behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Reasonable, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scoring and reasoning are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's role in status and inbox management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Identifies network calls as potential points transmitting user data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The code is standard API interaction code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that the code is legitimate and safe is appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the report's reasoning and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes data from user context and internal data attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes network requests as potential data transmission points.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The code is straightforward API client code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The low security risk assessment is justified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; reasoning and scoring are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code's purpose and data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Appropriately notes network API calls as potential points of data transmission.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears standard and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 are suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; the report's reasoning and scoring are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or suspicious behavior:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present in any report.\n- **Malware risk:** Appropriately scored as 0 across all reports.\n- **Security risk:** Uniformly low (0.2), justified given the nature of the code as an API client.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores based on review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity or malware present)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard low risk for API client code handling user data)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code's behavior. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security issues beyond the inherent risks of transmitting user data over network requests, which are typical for such SDK components.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code appears safe, well-structured, and standard for a client SDK managing user statuses via external API calls.",
