  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python SDK (`leancloud`).\n- It imports common modules (`setuptools`, `os`, `sys`) but does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted input.\n- Dependencies are specified with environment markers, and package metadata appears typical.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The code performs standard package setup procedures.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Observations:\n- **Presence of malicious code or backdoors:** None.\n- **Handling of untrusted data:** None.\n- **Dynamic code execution or obfuscation:** None.\n- **External data access or network activity:** None.\n- **Hardcoded credentials or secrets:** None.\n- **Obfuscation:** No.\n- **Malicious intent:** Not evident.\n\n### Review of the Reports:\nAll five reports consistently state that:\n- The code is a standard setup script.\n- No suspicious behavior, malicious payloads, or obfuscation.\n- No anomalies or security risks detected.\n- The code follows common practices for Python packaging.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n### Scoring Analysis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, justified as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The dependency specifications include environment markers, which are standard.\n- No external data or user input is processed.\n- The code is static and straightforward.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores align with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the detailed reviews and the code's simplicity, there is no evidence of supply chain attack or malicious intent.\n- The dependency versions are reasonable and typical.\n- The code does not invoke any suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis matches the consensus from the reports and the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard setup script for packaging a Python SDK, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
