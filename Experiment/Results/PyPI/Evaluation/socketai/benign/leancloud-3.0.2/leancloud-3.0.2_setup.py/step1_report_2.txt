{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for packaging and distributing the 'leancloud' Python SDK, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads package dependencies (install_requires), package discovery (find_packages), and metadata fields such as url, author, license.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external inputs processed at runtime.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this is static setup code that does not process external input or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code follows standard Python packaging practices. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines package dependencies based on Python version. It specifies package metadata, dependencies, and extras. There are no dynamic code executions, no reading of external inputs at runtime, nor any network or data leakage points. All dependencies and metadata appear typical for a Python package setup. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging. It contains no malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It performs expected tasks for package distribution without processing untrusted data or executing malicious operations.",
