  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently describe the code as a standard, benign setup script for packaging the 'leancloud' Python SDK.\n- No suspicious behaviors, malicious code, obfuscation, or external data handling are observed.\n- The dependencies and metadata are typical for such a package.\n- No anomalies, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The confidence scores are high (1), and malware/security risk scores are zero across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the original code snippet.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None detected.\n- **Suspicious dependencies or code patterns:** No.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in reasoning:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a standard setup script.\n- They do not overlook any subtle issues, as none are present.\n- The analysis is consistent and thorough.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very low, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk and malware scores:\n- The code performs only package setup functions.\n- No external data, user input, or network activity occurs.\n- No malicious or suspicious code constructs are present.\n- The dependencies are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the reports are consistent and accurate, there's no need to adjust scores.\n- The overall assessment aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0**\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, safe setup script with no security issues or malicious behavior. The detailed reviews support this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If any future reports suggest hidden malicious dependencies or dynamic code execution, reassessment would be necessary. But based on current data, the package is safe.",
