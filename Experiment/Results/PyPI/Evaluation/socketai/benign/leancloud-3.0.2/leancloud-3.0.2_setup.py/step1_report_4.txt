{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for packaging a Python SDK called 'leancloud', specifying dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies, package metadata, and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is static configuration for package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. No use of dynamic code execution or obfuscation. All dependencies and metadata appear standard and appropriate for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities, specifies dependencies with version constraints, and configures package metadata. No external input, user data, or untrusted data sources are processed. The dependencies are standard Python packages, and the code does not include any code injection, network activity, or suspicious behavior. The purpose is to package a Python SDK with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a package distribution script.",
