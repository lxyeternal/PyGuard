  "purpose": "This script is for setting up and configuring the Python package 'leancloud', including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies (install_requires), package metadata, and setup configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; the code does not execute or handle user input.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script defines configuration data without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are observed. The dependencies are standard Python packages; no obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools for packaging a Python project. It specifies dependencies with version constraints and package metadata. No user input handling, network connections, or dynamic code execution occurs. All dependencies appear legitimate and commonly used in Python projects. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious activities, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a typical setup configuration file for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data, nor does it contain any suspicious code or behaviors.",
