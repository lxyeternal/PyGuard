  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python SDK.\n- It imports only standard modules and setuptools.\n- Dependencies are specified with environment markers.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data handling is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are evident.\n- The code does not process user input or perform network operations.\n- All dependencies are common Python packages, and the script follows typical packaging practices.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate; describes standard setup script.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; the script is benign.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 — correct.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - securityRisk: 0 — correct.\n  - confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent findings.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n  - securityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n  - confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous reports, confirms standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 — correct.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - securityRisk: 0 — correct.\n  - confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Also consistent with previous analyses.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 — correct.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n  - securityRisk: 0 — correct.\n  - confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Provides a comprehensive overview, aligns with previous assessments.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n  - securityRisk: 0 — appropriate.\n  - confidence: 1 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and final assessment:\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify the code as a standard, benign setup script.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Confidence:** All are at 1, justified by the straightforward, standard nature of the code.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected or suggested).\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation observed).\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks identified).\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No adjustments needed. The assessments are appropriate based on the provided code and reports.",
