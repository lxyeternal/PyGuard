  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'leancloud' Python SDK, specifying dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, os, sys; data from local variables and setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None directly indicating untrusted data handling or external data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static variables and dependency lists into the setup() function to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data access observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures using setuptools, defining dependencies with environment markers. No suspicious behavior, malicious payloads, or malicious code patterns are present. The dependencies and metadata appear typical for a Python SDK package. The code structure is straightforward and conforms to common setup scripts. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python SDK. No malicious behavior, no security risks identified, and the code appears safe for use.",
