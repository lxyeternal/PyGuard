  "purpose": "Defines a GeoPoint class for geographical coordinate representation and distance calculations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for __init__, latitude and longitude setters, and the dump method.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through validation and property setters; distance calculations operate on internal state.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. No obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation of geographical points with validation and distance methods. No external data leaks, network communications, or backdoors are present. All calculations and validations are straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility class for geographical calculations with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
