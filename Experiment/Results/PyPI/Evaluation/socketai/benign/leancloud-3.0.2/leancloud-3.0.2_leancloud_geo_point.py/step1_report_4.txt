  "purpose": "This code defines a GeoPoint class for geographic coordinate representation and distance calculations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for latitude and longitude during object initialization and property setters.",
  "sinks": "Methods performing mathematical calculations; no direct data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through validation and property setters into internal variables; distance calculation methods use internal data without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The code performs standard geographic calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for handling geographic points, including validation, distance calculations, and equality checks. No external data inputs, network operations, or security-sensitive operations are present. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns identified. The purpose appears to be purely geographic computations. No obfuscation or malware-like behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for geographic point management and distance calculation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious patterns found.",
