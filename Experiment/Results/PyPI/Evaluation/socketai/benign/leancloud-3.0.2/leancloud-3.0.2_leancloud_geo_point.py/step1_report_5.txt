  "purpose": "Define a GeoPoint class for geographic coordinate representation and distance calculations.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input; all parameters are passed via methods or constructor.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data to external sources or untrusted outputs; dump() returns a dict.",
  "flows": "N/A – no external data flow or untrusted data propagation present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward and mathematically focused.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for geographic points with validation, property setters/getters, and distance calculations. It uses standard math functions and input validation. No dynamic code execution, no network or file I/O, no suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a clean implementation of geographic calculations without hidden malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of a GeoPoint class with distance calculations. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. Overall security risk is negligible.",
