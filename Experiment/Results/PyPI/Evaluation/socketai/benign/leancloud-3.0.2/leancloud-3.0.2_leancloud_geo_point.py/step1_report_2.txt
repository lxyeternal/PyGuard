{
  "purpose": "The code defines a GeoPoint class for representing geographic coordinates and computing distances between points.",
  "sources": "The class constructor (__init__), property setters, dump method, and distance calculation methods (radians_to, kilometers_to, miles_to).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leakage, code injection, or other malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input data (latitude, longitude) flows through validation and setters into internal variables, used in distance calculations without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs standard geographic calculations, uses validation, and contains no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code properly validates geographic coordinates within acceptable ranges. Distance calculations use standard trigonometric formulas without external data or network access. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic observed. The author metadata is harmless. No input/output operations that could be exploited, and the data handling appears secure and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a geographic coordinate class with distance calculations. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It is safe and appears well-implemented for its purpose.",
