  "purpose": "A utility class for representing geographic points with validation and distance calculations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters latitude and longitude during initialization and property setters.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks; internal calculations only.",
  "flows": "Input validation flows from property setters to internal validation; distance calculations use internal properties.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a GeoPoint class with validation for latitude and longitude, distance calculation methods using standard formulas, and equality checks. It does not perform external network operations, handle untrusted input beyond validation, or include obfuscation or malicious code. The validation ensures proper ranges, and the distance functions are mathematically standard. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The author info is harmless metadata. The code's structure and logic are clear and well-implemented, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard geographic utility class with proper validation and distance calculations. There is no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. All reports correctly identify its safety. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0.",
