  "purpose": "A utility class for representing geographic points and calculating distances between them.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters, property setters, and the dump method which access latitude and longitude attributes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks such as network, database, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (latitude, longitude) flow into validation and storage; distance methods read these attributes to compute distances.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; code appears straightforward and standard for geographic calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a GeoPoint class with validation, property setters/getters, distance calculations, and equality checks. Validation ensures latitude and longitude are within valid ranges. Distance methods convert degrees to radians and compute distances using spherical formulas. No external data sources, no code injection points, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code is purely computational and does not interact with external systems or handle untrusted input beyond simple attribute validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for geographic calculations without malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Overall security risk is minimal.",
