{
  "purpose": "This code is for setting up a Python package named 'utils-nuuuwan', including specifying metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the static string values for package name, version, author info, URLs, and the install_requires list.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the setuptools.setup() call which executes the setup process, and the dynamic string interpolations used in package name, URL, and other fields.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static strings and variables into the setup() function parameters, with no untrusted external input or user data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, no hardcoded credentials beyond typical package metadata, and no dynamic execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. All data sources are hardcoded static strings or predefined variables. There are no user inputs, environment variable reads, or external data sources that could introduce malicious data. The data flows straightforwardly into the setup() function, which is a standard procedure for package distribution. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The dependencies listed are also named in a manner consistent with legitimate packages. Overall, this appears to be a benign setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies in a conventional manner.",
