{
  "purpose": "The script is used for configuring and installing a Python package named 'utils-nuuuwan' with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string values for package metadata, dependencies, URLs, author info, and classification.",
  "sinks": "None of the code involves handling untrusted input or performing data output that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining package parameters to invoking setuptools.setup() to configure the package, with no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The dependencies are standard, and there are no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation. The package metadata appears typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. All data are hardcoded or predefined variables, with no user input, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. The dependencies are named with consistent patterns and do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines package metadata and dependencies in a typical manner.",
