  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a utility library, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static strings defining package name, version, author info, URLs, and dependencies; no external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns; dependencies are project-specific and appear legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools, with all parameters hardcoded and no external input or dynamic code. Dependencies follow a consistent naming pattern, and the script performs standard package configuration. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal security risk score assigned in some reports (0.1) is unjustified given the static nature of the code; it should be 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safety. The only correction is to set the security risk score to 0 across all assessments. The package is safe for use.",
