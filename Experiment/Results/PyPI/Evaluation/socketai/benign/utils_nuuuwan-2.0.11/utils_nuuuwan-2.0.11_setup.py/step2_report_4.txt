  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The script is a straightforward setup.py for a package named 'utils-nuuuwan'. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard setup script with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a typical setup script with static data, no external inputs, no obfuscation. Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), but justified given the static nature and the potential for misconfiguration or dependency issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Justified. No malware, no obfuscation, minimal security concern due to dependency management.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard setup script with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—benign, static setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious patterns, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the static, benign nature of the code, the risk scores are appropriately low. The only minor exception is Report 3, which assigns 0.1—this is reasonable, considering the dependency list and static configuration could, in theory, introduce supply chain risks if dependencies are compromised, but there's no direct evidence of such.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across the board is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, or possibly 0.1 as in Report 3, reflecting minimal supply chain risk due to dependency management.\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 to 0.1 (considering supply chain risks inherent in dependencies, but no direct evidence here)\n\n**Conclusion:** The package setup code appears safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and minimal security risk.",
