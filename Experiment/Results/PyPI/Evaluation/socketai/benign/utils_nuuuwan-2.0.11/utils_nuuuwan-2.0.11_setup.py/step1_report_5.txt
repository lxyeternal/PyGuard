{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'utils', specifying metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data for package metadata (name, version, author, description, URLs), dependencies (INSTALL_REQUIRES), and setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or user input; the script primarily handles static configuration data.",
  "flows": "The setup data is defined statically and passed directly to setuptools functions; there are no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. All dependencies are standard naming conventions; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and other setup options. No code execution beyond static data assignment and function calls. No indication of malicious behavior or obfuscated code. Dependencies are explicitly listed and appear to be project-specific utility packages. The code does not perform any runtime operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward configuration file with no signs of sabotage.",
