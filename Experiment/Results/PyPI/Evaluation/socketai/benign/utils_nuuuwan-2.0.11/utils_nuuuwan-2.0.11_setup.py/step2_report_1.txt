  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the script is a standard setup script with no anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious intent. The dependencies and metadata are typical, and no external or untrusted input is involved.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward and typical for a setup script. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the absence of dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. It concludes the script is benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Evaluation:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the script is described as a standard setup script. Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) is noted, but justified as minimal and related to static configuration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n- **Evaluation:** The small securityRisk score seems reasonable given the static nature; no malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, confirming no anomalies or malicious behavior. The securityRisk remains at 0.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Evaluation:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also describes a typical setup script with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent. SecurityRisk=0.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Evaluation:** The assessment aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code contains only static package setup configuration. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious dependencies are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are 0, which is correct; the code is straightforward without obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report giving 0.1 for minimal security risk due to static configuration. This is reasonable, as static setup scripts generally pose negligible security risks unless they include secrets or dynamic code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard Python setup script, with no dynamic code, no external input, no obfuscation, and no malicious dependencies.\n- The dependencies are named in a pattern consistent with legitimate utility packages.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation are detected.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 for very minimal static configuration risk, but 0 is acceptable)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores assigned are appropriate. The code appears entirely benign.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes are necessary; the assessment is consistent with the code's nature.",
