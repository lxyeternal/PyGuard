  "purpose": "This script is for setting up a Python package named 'utils-nuuuwan' with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments and function calls; no input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static setup code without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. No dynamic execution or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. All variables are statically assigned, and the setup call is straightforward. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The dependencies are explicitly listed and appear to be legitimate package references. The overall structure is typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no suspicious code or malicious instructions.",
