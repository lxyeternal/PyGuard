{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'utils-nuuuwan', configuring package metadata and dependencies for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded strings for package name, version, description, author info, URLs, classifiers, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data flows into a security-sensitive operation; no input or output of untrusted data is present.",
  "flows": "The script assigns hardcoded strings and package dependencies directly into the setup() function without dynamic content or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are present. All code appears straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup using setuptools, defining metadata, dependencies, and configuration parameters. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. All values are hardcoded static strings. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard, benign package configuration for a Python project. It does not contain any malicious code, malicious dependencies, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical packaging conventions.",
