  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the accuracy of their conclusions, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any risks are overlooked.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code snippet is solely import statements from various utility modules.\n- No functions, data processing, network activity, or user input handling are present.\n- Repeated imports (e.g., utils_base) are noted but are likely redundant rather than malicious.\n- The \"no-auto\" comment may be a marker but doesn't suggest malicious intent.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies that the code is just import statements, with no malicious content.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 (high)\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Also correctly notes the minimal nature of the code, with duplicate import of utils_base.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Assessment:** The security risk score of 0.1 might be slightly high given the benign nature of import statements. Unless there's a specific reason to suspect that these modules are malicious, the risk should remain very low.\n\n**Recommendation:** Reduce securityRisk to 0, as no actual security risk is demonstrated.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Again, the risk score appears to be overestimating the threat level. No evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Recommendation:** Lower securityRisk to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as benign import statements, with redundant utils_base import.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, the risk score should be minimal.\n\n**Recommendation:** Set securityRisk to 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Consistent with others, benign import statements.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Assessment:** No issues; risk should be 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Justification & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly overestimated at 0.1 in some reports. Given the fragment's benign nature, a score of 0 is more appropriate unless additional context suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (unless future code shows malicious behavior)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the provided code snippet, which appears to be standard import statements with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The only adjustment needed is to lower the security risk scores from 0.1 to 0, reflecting the absence of any security threat in this fragment.",
