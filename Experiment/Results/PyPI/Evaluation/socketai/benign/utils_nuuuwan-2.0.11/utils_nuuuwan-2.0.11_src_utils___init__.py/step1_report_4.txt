  "purpose": "Import statements for various utility modules, likely to be used elsewhere in the larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements at the top of the file, importing modules such as utils_ai, utils_base, utils_git, utils_lang, utils_twitter, utils_www.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No executable code or data flow present; only imports are specified.",
  "anomalies": "Multiple imports from the same module (utils_base) without any further code, potentially indicating incomplete code or a placeholder. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, which are standard in Python for modular design. The repeated import of 'utils_base' may be redundant but is not inherently malicious. There are no suspicious functions, no data processing, and no evident data leaks or malicious behavior within this snippet. The presence of 'no-auto' comment may suggest a manual or controlled environment, but it does not influence security assessment directly. Overall, the code appears benign based solely on these import statements.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet contains only import statements with no executable or malicious code. There is no evidence of malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks in this fragment.",
