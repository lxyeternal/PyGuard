  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard Python `setup.py` script.\n- No untrusted data, user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- The code adheres to common packaging conventions and contains no obfuscation or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears correct and functional for its purpose—configuring package metadata and dependencies.\n- **Malware presence:** The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly note that the code is not obfuscated.\n- **Security risks:** No security risks are identified; the setup script is static and safe.\n\n### Review of scores:\n- The **confidence** scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The **malware** scores are 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated** scores are 0, correctly indicating the code is clear and standard.\n- The **securityRisk** scores are 0, aligning with the overall benign assessment.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The reports correctly interpret the code's purpose.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all findings are based on static analysis.\n- The data flow is purely static configuration, with no external or untrusted data involved.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores are appropriate**; no adjustments needed.\n- The high confidence (1) is justified given the code's simplicity and adherence to standard practices.\n- The malware score remains at 0, as no malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the overall conclusion that the code is a benign, standard setup script with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical, safe Python package setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores reflect this correctly, and no changes are necessary.",
