  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package called 'pysnowflake', configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst file for long_description; importing 'os' and 'setuptools' modules; defining package information and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the script primarily configures package metadata and dependencies without executing untrusted code or data.",
  "flows": "Reads file content to set long_description; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup process is static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears standard for a Python package setup script with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries, reads a README file for description, and sets up package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It follows typical structure for a setup.py file. No hardcoded secrets, no code injection, or malicious code patterns are present. The package metadata appears legitimate. No suspicious behavior or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures package information for distribution.",
