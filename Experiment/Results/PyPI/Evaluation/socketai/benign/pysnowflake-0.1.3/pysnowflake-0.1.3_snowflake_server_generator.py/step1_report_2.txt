{
  "purpose": "Generate unique IDs based on timestamp, data center ID, worker ID, and sequence number.",
  "sources": "time.time() for current timestamp, input parameters dc and worker for node identification",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; ID generation is internal, only uses internal variables and system time",
  "flows": "System time and input parameters influence the generated ID; no external untrusted input directly affects data flow",
  "anomalies": "Use of recursion in get_next_id() for sequence overload; no apparent malicious intent but could cause stack issues if overload persists",
  "analysis": "The code generates IDs based on timestamp and node identifiers, using system time and internal counters. It handles clock regressions by raising HTTP errors. The sequence number overflows are managed with sleep and recursion. No hardcoded secrets, no external data leaks, and no suspicious external network activity. The code appears to be a standard ID generator with no malicious behavior or sabotage indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward ID generator implementing a timestamp-based scheme. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. It appears safe and legitimate.",
