  "purpose": "Generate unique, time-based IDs incorporating node ID and sequence number for distributed systems.",
  "sources": "System time (`time.time()`), class constructor parameters (`dc`, `worker`), internal sequence counter, clock regression check.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not write to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "System time -> ID calculation; clock regression check -> error; sequence overflow -> recursive call -> ID generation.",
  "anomalies": "Recursive call in `get_next_id()` when sequence exceeds maximum, which could cause stack overflow under persistent overload.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward distributed ID generator using timestamp, node ID, and sequence. It handles clock going backwards by raising an HTTP error, and manages sequence overflow with recursion and sleep. No external network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The recursive overload handling, while potentially problematic under extreme conditions, is not malicious. The code's logic is clear and intended for ID generation. The main concern is the recursive call that could cause stack overflow if overload persists, but this is a performance and reliability issue, not a security vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign ID generator with no malicious intent. The recursive overload handling is a minor design flaw but does not constitute a security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the potential for performance issues under overload. Overall, the code is safe, with only minor implementation concerns.",
