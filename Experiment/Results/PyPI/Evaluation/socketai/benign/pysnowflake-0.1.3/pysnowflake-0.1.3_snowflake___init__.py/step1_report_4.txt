{
  "purpose": "Assign the author metadata to the variable __author__.",
  "sources": "The code reads a string literal 'tarzan' as the author information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks since only a static assignment exists.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, containing only an author attribute assignment with no other logic or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string 'tarzan' to the variable __author__, which is a common metadata attribute in Python scripts. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious activity or obfuscation. The simplicity and lack of dynamic or external data suggest no malicious intent. No code injection, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only as metadata. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
