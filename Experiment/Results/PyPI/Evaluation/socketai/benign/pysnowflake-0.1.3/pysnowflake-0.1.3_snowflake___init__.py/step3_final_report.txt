  "purpose": "Metadata declaration of author information in a Python module",
  "sources": "Assignment to __author__ variable",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "None; static assignment without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string assignment",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a static string assignment to __author__, a common practice for module metadata. There are no input sources, data processing, or data sinks. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code is simple, standard, and benign, with no dynamic execution or external dependencies. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified given the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign metadata declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are consistent with the code's simplicity.",
