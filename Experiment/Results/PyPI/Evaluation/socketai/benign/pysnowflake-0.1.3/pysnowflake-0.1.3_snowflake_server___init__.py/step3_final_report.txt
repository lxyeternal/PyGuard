  "purpose": "A Tornado-based web server providing ID and stats endpoints, configured via environment variables and command-line options, utilizing an external Generator class for ID creation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables PSF_DC and PSF_WORKER, command-line options, and the external Generator class.",
  "sinks": "The code writes generated IDs and stats directly to HTTP responses; no untrusted data processing or external network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and command-line options set configuration; Generator's get_next_id() and stats are retrieved and sent as responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Tornado server with two endpoints, relying on an external Generator class. It reads configuration securely from environment variables and options. The responses are simple JSON or string outputs. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are evident. The main concern is the external Generator class, which is not provided; if malicious, it could pose a risk, but based solely on this code, no malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, assuming the external Generator class is secure. Scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
