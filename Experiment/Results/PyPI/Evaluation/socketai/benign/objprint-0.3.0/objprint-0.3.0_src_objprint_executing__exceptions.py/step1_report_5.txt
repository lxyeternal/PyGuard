  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling known issues and verification failures in a Python program.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their constructors, specifically the Exception class initializations.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data input or output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted inputs; exception parameters are provided internally or by other parts of the program, not shown here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated logic detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exceptions, KnownIssue and VerifierFailure, inheriting from Exception. The KnownIssue class is a simple marker exception with no additional logic. VerifierFailure captures a title, node, and instruction, and initializes its base Exception with the title. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to serve as part of an error handling or validation framework within a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of custom exception classes without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities. It functions as intended for error signaling.",
