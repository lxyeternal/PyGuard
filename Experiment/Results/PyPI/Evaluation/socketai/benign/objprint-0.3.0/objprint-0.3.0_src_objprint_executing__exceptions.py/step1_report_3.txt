{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling known issues and verification failures, likely used for debugging or error handling within a larger Python application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their constructors, specifically in the __init__ method of VerifierFailure.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising mechanisms, which are standard and do not lead to data leaks or system effects on their own.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident; the code primarily defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. The code is straightforward class definition with standard exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. KnownIssue is a simple placeholder for known problems, with no internal logic. VerifierFailure captures additional context via its constructor, storing a node and instruction, and passing a title to the base Exception. All constructs are standard Python class definitions for error handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious intent. The code does not perform any network activity, data collection, or system modifications. It appears to be part of a larger error handling framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes used for error reporting. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this fragment.",
