  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Purpose:**\n   - The code defines two custom exception classes: `KnownIssue` and `VerifierFailure`.\n   - Both classes inherit from `Exception`.\n   - `VerifierFailure` stores additional context (`node` and `instruction`) and passes a `title` to the base class.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code is purely class definitions for error handling.\n   - No input/output, data processing, network activity, or external communication.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n   - The code appears standard and benign.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious logic, or security concerns are identified.\n   - The purpose is clearly for internal debugging/error management.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n   - **Security risk score:** All assign 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n   - **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very low (0.0), which makes sense given the context.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The code is straightforward; no issues detected.\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n   - No need to increase any scores; the code is safe.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations:**\n   - The code is simple exception class definitions, typical in Python projects.\n   - No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n   - The detailed `VerifierFailure` class is useful for debugging but not suspicious.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the code's benign nature.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes used for internal error handling. There are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation present. The reports' scores are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary; the current scoring and analysis are correct.",
