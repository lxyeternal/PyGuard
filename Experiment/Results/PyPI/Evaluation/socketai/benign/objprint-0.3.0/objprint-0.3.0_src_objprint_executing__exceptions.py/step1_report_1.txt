{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling known issues and verification failures in a Python program, likely for internal debugging or error management.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and a constructor with no input reading or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output, no external communication or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code contains class definitions and a constructor without data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes: KnownIssue and VerifierFailure. KnownIssue is a simple exception with a descriptive docstring, and VerifierFailure is a more detailed exception with an initializer that stores specific attributes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions used for internal error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, consisting solely of class definitions for exception handling with no malicious or security-threatening features. It does not contain any suspicious behavior or malicious intent.",
