  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for internal error handling and validation.",
  "sources": "Class instantiation and attribute assignment within exception constructors.",
  "sinks": "No external data, input, or output; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects with optional data stored in attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two straightforward exception class definitions with no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. Both classes serve as custom error types, with one storing additional context. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is standard and benign, with scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, reflecting its safe nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
