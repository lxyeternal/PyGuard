{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to known issues and verification failures in a program, likely for debugging or error handling.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; code defines exception classes and their initializations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; the code only defines classes and constructors.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; class definitions do not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with descriptive docstrings. The VerifierFailure class has an __init__ method that stores node and instruction parameters, then calls the superclass constructor with a title. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The classes serve as structured error types for debugging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Python exception class definitions with clear purpose and no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
