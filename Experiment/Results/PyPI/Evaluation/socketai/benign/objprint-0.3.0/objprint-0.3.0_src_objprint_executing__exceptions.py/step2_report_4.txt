  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Issues Presence**:\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions: `KnownIssue` and `VerifierFailure`.\n   - No data processing, external input/output, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - The classes are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The code is benign and appears to be part of an internal error handling framework.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is standard exception class definitions.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n   - The analysis consistently states that there's no malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `risk`: 0.5 or lower\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `malware` score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is detected.\n   - The `securityRisk` score of 0 is justified; the code does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n   - The `obfuscated` score of 0 is justified; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities & Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is standard.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; all observations are accurate.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - The high confidence (1) aligns with the straightforward, well-understood code.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions, the risk of malware or security issues is minimal.\n   - The code could be part of a larger system, but in isolation, it is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Overall, the code is benign.** It is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The reports are accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis reflects the benign and standard nature of the code snippet.",
