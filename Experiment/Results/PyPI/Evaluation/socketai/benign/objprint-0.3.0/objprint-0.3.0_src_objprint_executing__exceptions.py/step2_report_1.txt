  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the scores assigned, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code defines two custom exception classes, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external data handling, network activity, or data leaks.\n- The purpose appears to be internal error handling, debugging, or validation.\n\n**Scores assigned:**\n- Malware: 0 in all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated: 0 in all reports, accurate given the straightforward code.\n- SecurityRisk: 0 in all reports, appropriate since there's no evidence of security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The only point of contention might be the risk score. Since all reports assign 0, and there's no suspicious activity, this seems justified.\n- The \"malware\" score is also correctly assigned as 0, given the benign code.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The code does not contain any hidden malicious logic, obfuscation, or data leaks.\n- The exception classes are standard and serve typical error handling purposes.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent and justified.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The scores are reasonable and align with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The overall assessment should be that this code fragment is entirely benign with no security risks.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1 (minimal, but still no actual risk; keeping it very low to reflect triviality)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security-threatening features. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action required. The code is safe, and the report's conclusions are accurate.",
