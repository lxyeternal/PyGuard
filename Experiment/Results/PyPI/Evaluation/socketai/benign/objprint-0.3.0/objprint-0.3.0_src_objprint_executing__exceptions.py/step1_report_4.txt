  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling known issues and verification failures in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; the code defines classes with no data input handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply defines exception classes without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two custom exception classes, 'KnownIssue' and 'VerifierFailure'. These classes are simple subclasses of Exception, with 'VerifierFailure' including an initializer to store additional context data. There are no dynamic code executions, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors present. The code is straightforward and standard for defining exception types, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger codebase for error handling, with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
