{
  "purpose": "The code performs source code introspection to extract function call arguments, source segments, and analyze execution frames, primarily for debugging or profiling purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads source code via inspect.getsource, retrieves AST nodes from Source.executing(frame), tokenizes function call strings, and inspects call frames for context.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; source code and frame data are processed internally without network, file writes, or code execution.",
  "flows": "Source code is obtained from inspect and Source; tokens are generated from the function call string; frame data flows through get_args and return_object methods for analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard use of introspection modules; relies on external Source class, but no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python introspection libraries to analyze call frames and source code segments. It does not perform any network activity, file modification, or execute untrusted code. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The potential risk lies in source code inspection if malicious sources are present, but this is an inherent limitation of such tools, not a malicious feature. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard debugging utility performing source and frame analysis without malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and justified, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk reflects inherent risks in source inspection but does not indicate malicious activity.",
