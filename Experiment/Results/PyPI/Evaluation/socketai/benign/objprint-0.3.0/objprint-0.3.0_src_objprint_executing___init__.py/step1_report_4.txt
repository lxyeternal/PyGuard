{
  "purpose": "This code provides a module interface for inspecting the current execution frame and version information, primarily used for debugging or introspection.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__version__' variable from an imported 'version' module and the 'frame' parameter in the usage example (though not used directly in this fragment).",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or process untrusted data; it only retrieves version info and defines imports.",
  "flows": "N/A — there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns or anomalies detected. The version check with 'dev' in the version string and fallback behavior is standard for auto-generated versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a namedtuple for version info. It attempts to import a version string, checks for 'dev' to set a default version if import fails or version is a development build, and sets version info accordingly. The only potential concern is the import from a relative module '.version', but this appears standard for package version management. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module setup for introspection and version management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
