{
  "purpose": "Provides versioning information and imports for a module that interacts with code execution frames, likely for debugging or introspection.",
  "sources": "Imports from executing module, version information from version.py, and standard library collections.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Imports and version parsing flow, with no direct untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except to handle missing or malformed version info; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscation or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and constructs a named tuple for version info. It conditionally attempts to import a version string, raising an exception if it contains 'dev', and falls back to default version values. This pattern is typical for version management. No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard version and import handling, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain suspicious behavior or malware indicators.",
