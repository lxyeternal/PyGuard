{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a part of a package that provides introspection into Python execution frames, specifically for examining the current state of a frame and its AST node.",
  "sources": "Imports from collections, internal modules (.executing, .version), and the __version__ variable from version.py",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; no data output, external network connections, or file writes are present",
  "flows": "The version string is parsed into __version_info__, but only if __version__ does not contain 'dev'; otherwise, defaults are used",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the fallback __version__ set to '???' and version info set to -1 values, which is unusual but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code defines a named tuple for version info, imports internal modules, and attempts to set a version string and version info. If the version contains 'dev' or an exception occurs, it assigns default values. There are no external inputs or untrusted data sources, nor are there any suspicious code patterns such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module snippet used for introspection and version handling. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages version info and exposes a 'Source' class.",
