  "purpose": "Provides introspection into Python execution frames and manages version info with fallback defaults.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version string parsing, fallback version info assignment",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Version string parsing and fallback assignment, no external data flow",
  "anomalies": "Fallback version info with '???' and -1 values is unusual but benign",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign utility for version management and frame introspection. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The fallback version info indicates auto-generated or incomplete versioning but is not malicious. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe module with no malicious activity or security risks. The minor fallback version info handling is typical and not a security concern.",
