{
  "purpose": "This code provides terminal color support and compatibility for Windows consoles, primarily for styling output text with colors.",
  "sources": "Reads from the 'sys' module for platform detection and from 'ctypes' to interact with Windows API for console configuration.",
  "sinks": "Uses string formatting to wrap text with ANSI color codes, but no untrusted input is processed or directly influences the output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the color setting function only formats static strings and does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code primarily focuses on platform detection and terminal styling.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up terminal color codes and adjusts Windows console settings to support ANSI escape sequences. It performs platform detection and conditionally imports 'ctypes' for Windows-specific API calls. The 'set_color' function applies color formatting to strings if supported. There are no external data inputs, malicious behavior, or security-sensitive operations involved. The code is straightforward, intended for output styling, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and designed for terminal output styling. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard utility for cross-platform color support without any suspicious intent.",
