{
  "purpose": "Define color codes and handle console color support for terminal output, primarily for cross-platform compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.platform to determine the operating system; attempts to load ctypes.windll for Windows console support.",
  "sinks": "Uses string formatting to embed ANSI color codes into output strings.",
  "flows": "Detect platform -> set color support -> apply color codes to strings if supported.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard platform detection and color setting logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines ANSI escape sequences for terminal colors and manages platform-specific support for Windows consoles using ctypes. It checks the platform and attempts to enable ANSI support on Windows. The function set_color applies the color codes conditionally based on support. There are no external inputs, network connections, or sensitive data handling. The code is straightforward and standard for console coloring, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for handling terminal text coloring with cross-platform support. No malicious behavior, no malicious code, and no security risks identified.",
