  "purpose": "Provides terminal color support with platform-specific configuration for Windows, enabling ANSI escape sequences when supported.",
  "sources": "sys.platform check, windll.kernel32.SetConsoleMode call, ANSI escape code definitions",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data",
  "flows": "Platform detection leads to conditional enabling of ANSI support; set_color wraps strings with color codes if supported",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; straightforward implementation",
  "analysis": "The code defines ANSI color codes, detects platform, and enables ANSI support on Windows via ctypes. The set_color function conditionally wraps strings with color codes based on support. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious code are present. The logic is standard and benign, with no obfuscation or vulnerabilities. All signals indicate safe, utility code for terminal styling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for terminal color support with proper platform handling. No malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are present. The assigned malware score of 0, security risk score of 0, and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate and justified.",
