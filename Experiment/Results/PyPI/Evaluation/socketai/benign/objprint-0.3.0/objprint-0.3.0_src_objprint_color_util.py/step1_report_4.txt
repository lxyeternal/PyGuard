  "purpose": "Define terminal text colors and handle color support detection for cross-platform compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads from sys.platform and sys, and attempts to load ctypes.windll on Windows.",
  "sinks": "Uses string formatting to add ANSI color codes to strings.",
  "flows": "Reads platform info from sys.platform, and based on it, conditionally loads ctypes.windll. The set_color function adds color codes to input strings if supported.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs detected. The code only manages terminal color output, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system and configures ANSI color support accordingly. It conditionally loads Windows API functions for console support. The set_color function applies ANSI color codes if supported. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious activities are present. The code is straightforward and intended for terminal display enhancement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and solely related to terminal color management. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected.",
