{
  "purpose": "Defines color constants and manages console color support for terminal output, particularly for Windows systems.",
  "sources": "Reads the platform information from sys.platform; attempts to import windll from ctypes; accesses system handles through windll.kernel32.SetConsoleMode and windll.kernel32.GetStdHandle.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; the code formats strings with color escape sequences, but does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Uses platform detection to decide whether to apply color formatting; no untrusted data flow from input to output.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. It conditionally sets console support and formats strings with ANSI escape sequences.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up ANSI color codes for terminal output and adjusts console modes on Windows to support ANSI escape sequences. It reads system platform info and attempts to modify console settings via system calls. There are no external data inputs or outputs involving untrusted sources. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is simple and appears intended for formatting console output with colors, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for color formatting in console applications, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
