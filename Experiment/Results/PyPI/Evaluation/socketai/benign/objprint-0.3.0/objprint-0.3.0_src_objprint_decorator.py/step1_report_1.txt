{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator function 'add_objprint' that modifies the __str__ method of classes to customize their string representation, either as JSON or formatted string, using internal _objprint utilities.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the class or instance passed as 'orig_class', particularly its __str__ method and attributes for string conversion.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns a new __str__ method to classes, potentially influencing output, but it does not involve untrusted data sources or network I/O.",
  "flows": "Input data (classes or instances) are modified to include custom __str__ methods which generate string representations via _objprint functions, but no external or untrusted data is processed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The use of internal _objprint functions and dynamic method assignment appears standard for such decorator behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a decorator to override the __str__ method of classes for customized string output, supporting JSON and other formats. It imports internal modules (_objprint) presumed to be part of the package. The implementation involves typical Python decorator patterns with no suspicious code execution, network activity, or data leaks. The functions are confined to modifying class behavior, and there are no indications of malicious code injection, obfuscation, or external data handling. The code appears benign and intended for formatting output.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a utility for enhancing class string representations with formatting options. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It operates solely within class method modification scope, with no external or secret data involved.",
