{
  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator function to add custom string representations (__str__) to classes, supporting JSON serialization or custom formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads imported modules, function parameters (format, kwargs), and class objects passed to the decorator.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies class __str__ methods, but does not execute untrusted input or data directly. No external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Inputs from parameters and imports are used to define __str__ methods, which are then assigned to classes or instances.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code relies on external modules (_objprint), which are not shown; no malicious behavior detected from this code alone.",
  "analysis": "The code defines overloaded functions to add a custom __str__ method to classes. It conditionally supports JSON serialization or custom string formatting, importing modules as needed. The function wraps existing __str__ methods, or assigns a new one if a class is provided directly. It does not perform any network activity, file I/O, or execute untrusted code. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden operations are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for enhancing class string representations. No malicious intent or security risks are evident in this fragment. It’s a standard implementation for customizing object output formatting.",
