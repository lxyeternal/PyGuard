{
  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator and function to add custom string representation methods (__str__) to classes, supporting JSON formatting and other configurations.",
  "sources": "Input data is derived from the class object passed as 'orig_class' or from user-defined parameters such as 'format' and '**kwargs'. No external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies class __str__ methods, which could influence how class instances are represented, potentially affecting logging or data display. No untrusted data sinks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input class object -> modification of __str__ method -> calls to _objprint functions for serialization or custom string generation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. Usage of functools.wraps and dynamic assignment of __str__ is standard for decorator patterns. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines overloaded functions for adding an objprint (object print) functionality to classes, supporting JSON and string formats. It imports internal module _objprint and dynamically overwrites or assigns the __str__ method. The logic appears to be for enhancing debugging or logging capabilities, with no signs of malicious activity or external communication. The use of json.dumps and custom string functions is standard and does not pose security risks. There are no input validation issues or dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for augmenting class string representations, aimed at improved debugging or logging. It does not contain malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities based on this fragment. No suspicious activity or malicious intent is evident.",
