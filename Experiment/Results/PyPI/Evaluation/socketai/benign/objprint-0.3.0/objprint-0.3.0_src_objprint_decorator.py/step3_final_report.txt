  "purpose": "Utility to modify the __str__ method of classes for custom formatting, supporting JSON and other formats.",
  "sources": "Internal module _objprint functions, invoked within the __str__ method override.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network activity, or untrusted data processing involved.",
  "flows": "Class instances are passed to the overridden __str__ method, which serializes them via internal functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; standard decorator pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that replaces or adds a __str__ method to classes, supporting JSON serialization or custom string formatting. It imports internal _objprint utilities presumed to handle serialization. No external data, network activity, or untrusted input is processed. The pattern is typical for class method decoration, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the provided reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with this benign analysis, considering the dynamic method assignment as a minimal risk factor. The internal module _objprint's safety cannot be confirmed from this code alone, but based on the context, it appears to be a standard serialization utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for customizing object string representations, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. The overall security risk is very low, primarily due to dynamic method modification, which is standard practice in such decorators.",
