  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for customizing object string representations, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. The overall security risk is very low, primarily due to dynamic method modification, which is standard practice in such decorators."
