{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator and function to add or modify the __str__ method of classes for custom string representations, supporting JSON and other formats.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only imports modules and accesses class methods.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies class __str__ methods, but does not execute untrusted data or perform dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; modifications are applied to class methods with no external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code is straightforward, using standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines overloads for a function that decorates classes to override their __str__ methods, allowing for JSON serialization or custom string formatting. It imports a local module '_objprint' and applies wrappers using functools. The logic appears to modify class behavior for printing, with no external data inputs or malicious operations. There are no hardcoded secrets, no system commands, and no network activity. The code’s structure and behavior are typical for a utility library aimed at enhancing class representations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for customizing class string representations and does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
