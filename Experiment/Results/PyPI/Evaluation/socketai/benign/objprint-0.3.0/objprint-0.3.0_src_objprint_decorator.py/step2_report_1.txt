  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a utility to modify the __str__ method of classes for custom formatting, supporting JSON and other formats.\n- The code imports internal modules (_objprint) presumed to be part of the package.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or untrusted data processing are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The logic appears standard for a decorator pattern in Python.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n- It modifies class behavior for formatting output, which is benign.\n- The reliance on internal modules (_objprint) is typical for a package utility, assuming these are well-maintained.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The only potential concern is the dynamic assignment of __str__ methods without validation, but this is a common pattern in decorators and not inherently risky.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent and appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign very low (0.1 or 0), which seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code operates within class method modification scope, with no external or secret data involved.\n- No suspicious patterns or assumptions are made about vulnerabilities.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9+), which aligns with the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, justified by the fact that it modifies class behavior, which could potentially affect debugging or logging, but not security.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard utility for customizing object string representations. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should stand as is.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n- The overall security risk is very low, with no malware or obfuscation concerns.",
