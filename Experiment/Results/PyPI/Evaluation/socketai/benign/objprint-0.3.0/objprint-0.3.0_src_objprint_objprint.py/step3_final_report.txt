{
  "purpose": "A configurable debugging and object visualization utility that inspects objects, retrieves call stack info, and formats output for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Input objects via function parameters, call stack info via inspect.currentframe(), object attributes via getattr(), and user configurations.",
  "sinks": "Outputs formatted data via print() and json.dumps(), potentially exposing internal data if misused.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input objects and call stack info into formatting functions, then to output functions like print() or json.dumps().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard reflection, formatting, and output methods typical for debugging tools. It does not perform network activity, file manipulation, or code execution. The use of json.dumps() and print() is safe and common. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The reflection and call stack inspection are used solely for debugging and visualization. The code is well-structured, readable, and free of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a benign, well-structured debugging utility with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minimal security risk score (0.1) is justified due to potential data exposure if misused, but no active malicious behavior is present.",
