{
  "purpose": "This code contains unit tests for configuration validation and object printing behavior, ensuring proper error handling and output filtering.",
  "sources": "Configuration functions (`config`) and object printing (`objprint`) that read parameters; in-memory objects (`ObjTest`) used for output verification.",
  "sinks": "Captured output via `io.StringIO` and `redirect_stdout` for verification; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "Configuration functions modify internal state; `objprint` outputs object data; output is captured and checked for expected content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected; straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite validating configuration error handling and output filtering. It uses common Python testing patterns with no external data flow, network activity, or malicious code. The code is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with its benign nature. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test suite with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
