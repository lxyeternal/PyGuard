  "purpose": "Unit tests for the objprint configuration and output formatting functions",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters and creates objects for testing; reads from imported modules",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout via redirect_stdout; assertions on output content",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters are set; objprint formats an object and writes to stdout; test assertions check output content",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behavior detected; no dynamic code execution or external network interactions",
  "analysis": "The code implements test cases for configuration management and object printing, utilizing standard Python modules and imported libraries. No untrusted data input, no network operations, and no suspicious code patterns are present. The use of redirect_stdout and assertions are typical for unit tests. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for the objprint library with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It only interacts with local objects and standard output.",
