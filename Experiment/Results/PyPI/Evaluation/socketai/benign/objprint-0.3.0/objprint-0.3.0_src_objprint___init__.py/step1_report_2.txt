{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and exports an object printing utility library, providing functions and configurations for pretty-printing objects in Python.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present. The code imports internal modules and assigns their functions to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only sets up internal references and exports functions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process or transfer data from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The license comments and versioning are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports classes and functions from local modules (.objprint and .decorator), creates an instance of ObjPrint, and assigns its methods and attributes to module-level variables for export. There is no dynamic code execution, external data input, or sensitive operations. The structure is typical for a Python library setup, with clear licensing comments and standard module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward library setup for object printing, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate, benign module with no security concerns.",
