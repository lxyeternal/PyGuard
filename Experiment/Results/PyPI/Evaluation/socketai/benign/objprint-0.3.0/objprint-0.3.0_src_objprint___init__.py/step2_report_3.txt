  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Reports 1-5 Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward setup for an object printing utility.\n- No external input sources, sinks, or data flows involving untrusted data are identified.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are observed.\n- The code imports local modules, creates a singleton object, and exposes its methods and attributes.\n- The license comments and URLs are standard for open-source projects.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty in their assessments.\n\n**Confirmations and Checks:**\n- The code matches the description: it’s a typical Python module setup for a utility library.\n- No signs of code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or external communications.\n- No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data.\n- The structure is consistent with benign package initialization code.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0. This is reasonable; the code is purely setup and does not introduce security risks.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- Since all reports agree and the code is as shown, there are no issues to challenge or adjust.\n- The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities or suspicious activity, which aligns with the code content.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign module initialization for an object printing utility.\n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and reasonable.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on the provided code and reports.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis. The module appears safe, with no malicious or security issues.",
