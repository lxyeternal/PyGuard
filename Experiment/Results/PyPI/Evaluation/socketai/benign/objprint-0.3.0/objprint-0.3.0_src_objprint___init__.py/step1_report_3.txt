{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a module that provides object printing and configuration utilities, likely for debugging or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the current module's namespace, importing components from local modules (.objprint and .decorator). It also accesses attributes of the ObjPrint class instance.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. The code assigns objects and functions to module-level variables.",
  "flows": "No significant data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive sinks; the code mainly initializes and exposes objects and functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two local modules, creates an instance of ObjPrint, and assigns it to multiple variables for external use. It also defines __all__ for export. There are no input sources, no data transformations, and no potential injection points. The code is purely setup and export of utility functions/objects with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup module for a Python package, exposing utility functions and objects without any malicious intent or security risks. It is benign, with no signs of malware or security issues.",
