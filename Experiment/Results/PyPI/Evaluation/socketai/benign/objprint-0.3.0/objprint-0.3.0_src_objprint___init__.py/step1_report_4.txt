{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and exports an object printing utility with configuration and decorator functions for debugging or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.objprint, .decorator); assignment statements initializing and exporting objects and functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data input or output sinks are present; no network, file, or environment interactions.",
  "flows": "The code creates an instance of ObjPrint and exposes its methods and configuration for use in other modules.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module setup by importing internal components, creating a singleton ObjPrint object, and exposing relevant methods and configurations. There are no input/output data flows involving external untrusted sources, nor any code execution, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms. The code appears to be a standard package initialization pattern without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical setup script for a Python package that provides object printing utilities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a benign module setup with no evident security concerns.",
