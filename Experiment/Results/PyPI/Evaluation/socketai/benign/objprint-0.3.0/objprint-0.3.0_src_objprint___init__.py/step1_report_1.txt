{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up an interface for an object printing and debugging utility, providing configurations and decorators for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "No input sources are present; all data originates from imports and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling are present; the code mainly assigns objects and functions.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code primarily initializes and exposes internal objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. No dynamic code execution or external communications.",
  "analysis": "The code imports components from local modules (.objprint and .decorator), creates an instance of ObjPrint, and exposes it and its methods/attributes via module-level variables and __all__. The structure is typical for a Python package setup, with no signs of malicious activity. The license comment and URLs point to an open-source project. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a debugging or object visualization utility with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
