  "purpose": "This code initializes and exports an object printing utility, providing functions and configuration for debugging or object visualization.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; all data comes from internal module imports and predefined variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows from external sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward module setup with no suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions from local modules, initializes an instance of ObjPrint, and exposes certain attributes and functions for external use. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network activity, secret handling, or code obfuscation. It functions as a typical package entry point, defining API exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module initialization script for an object printing utility. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
