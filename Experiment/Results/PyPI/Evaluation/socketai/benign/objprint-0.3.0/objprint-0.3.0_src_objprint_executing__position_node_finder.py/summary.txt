  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex static analysis and verification utility with no malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. It poses a low security risk, primarily due to its complexity and version-specific handling, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.2, reflecting its purpose as a verification tool."
