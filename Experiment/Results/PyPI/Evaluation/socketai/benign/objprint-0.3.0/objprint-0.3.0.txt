It poses a low security risk, primarily due to its complexity and version-specific handling, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.2, reflecting its purpose as a verification tool."

However, in its current form, there is no active malicious payload or behavior. The malware score is set at 0.2, reflecting potential misuse; obfuscation is minimal (0), and the security risk is moderate (0.4). Proper controls should be enforced when deploying or distributing this code, especially in untrusted environments."
