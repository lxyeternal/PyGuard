{
  "purpose": "This code manages line markers and spacing checks within test functions, primarily for validation and formatting purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'lines' list during initialization, and from method parameters such as line indices and types.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'build_error' method to generate AAAError objects, which include line number and character offset information for errors detected in the code.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the 'lines' list and method parameters into validation functions; errors are generated via 'build_error' based on line types and positions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The code uses standard Python features without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs line type management and spacing validation for test functions, utilizing internal state and line markers. It checks for spacing between code blocks, comment placement, and line type collisions. No external data or untrusted inputs are processed in a manner that could lead to injection or data leakage. The error reporting is based on line positions and character offsets, which is standard. The code does not contain any backdoors, malicious network activity, or secret access mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a well-structured, standard implementation for managing line markers and spacing validation in test scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It functions solely to enforce formatting rules and error reporting.",
