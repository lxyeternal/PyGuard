  "purpose": "Utility class for managing line types within test functions, performing validation checks on spacing, comments, and line type collisions.",
  "sources": "Reads lines from a list of strings; accesses line content for error reporting.",
  "sinks": "Error objects include line number and character offset; no external data or system interaction.",
  "flows": "Line content is analyzed to determine line types; errors are generated based on line positions and types.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; straightforward static validation logic; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code manages line types for test functions, performing spacing and comment validation, and reports errors with line and character offsets. It operates solely on in-memory data, with no external data, network activity, or system modifications. The logic is standard for static code validation, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Error reporting is based on line positions, which is typical. The code's purpose is validation, not execution or data handling, indicating no security risks or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static validation utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk should be set to 0, reflecting its safe and straightforward nature.",
