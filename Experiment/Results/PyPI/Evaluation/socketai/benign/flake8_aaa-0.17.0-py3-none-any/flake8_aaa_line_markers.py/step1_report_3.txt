{
  "purpose": "The code manages line types and spacing in test functions, providing validation and error reporting for code structure.",
  "sources": "Reads input from 'lines' (list of strings) during initialization and line_type values; accesses 'lines' for error positioning.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'AAAError' to report formatting issues; no sinks process untrusted data beyond internal validation.",
  "flows": "Analyzes line types to detect spacing and comment issues, generating errors when spacing rules are violated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data handling observed. No use of unsafe eval, exec, or network operations. The code is structured and descriptive.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, well-defined class handling line marking and spacing validation in test code. It reads line data, tracks line types, updates types with collision checks, and performs formatting validation through various methods. No suspicious or malicious logic such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors was detected. The only notable behavior is internal validation and error reporting. The code does not execute untrusted data or perform unsafe operations. The logic is straightforward and consistent with its purpose, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing and validating test code structure, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It strictly enforces formatting rules and reports issues, but does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.",
