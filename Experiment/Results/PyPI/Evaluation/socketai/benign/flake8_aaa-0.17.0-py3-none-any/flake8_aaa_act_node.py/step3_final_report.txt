{
  "purpose": "The code defines an ActNode class that identifies AST nodes marked with '# act' comments or of specific types (result assignment, pytest context manager, unittest raises), for testing or annotation purposes.",
  "sources": "AST nodes, comment tokens, helper functions for node classification",
  "sinks": "None; purely static AST analysis with no external data or system interaction",
  "flows": "Pattern matching comments and node type checks to classify nodes; recursive traversal into context managers",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward AST pattern matching and node classification, with no external I/O, network activity, or dynamic execution. Helper functions are assumed safe. The pattern matching relies on comments and node types, which are standard and benign. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for detecting 'act' markers in Python ASTs, with no malicious behavior or security risks. All reports correctly interpret the code as safe, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.",
