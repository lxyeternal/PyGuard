  "purpose": "Export the Checker class from the current package module for external use",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .checker import Checker' reads the Checker class from a local module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output occurs; no sinks identified",
  "flows": "The imported Checker class is exposed via __all__, but no data flows or processing occurs in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module and exposes it for public API use. It is a minimal, standard pattern for module exports with no malicious or suspicious elements. No external data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors are present. The code is very simple and follows typical Python conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to re-export a class for external use. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security issues are detected.",
