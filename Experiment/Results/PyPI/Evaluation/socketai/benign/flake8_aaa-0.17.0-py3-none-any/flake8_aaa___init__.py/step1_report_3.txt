  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code, only an import and an export list; no anomalies present.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward module that imports a class 'Checker' from a relative file and defines an __all__ list to specify exports. There are no data processing, input reading, or external communication operations. The code appears to serve as a module interface or API component, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module declaration with an import statement and an export list, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
