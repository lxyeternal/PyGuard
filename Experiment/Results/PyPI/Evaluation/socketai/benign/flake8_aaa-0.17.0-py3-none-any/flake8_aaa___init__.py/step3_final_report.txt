  "analysis": "The code imports a class 'Checker' from a local module and defines __all__ to expose it. It contains no data processing, external communication, or dynamic behavior. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security issues are present. The code is minimal and standard for module exports, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk being appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis.",
