{
  "purpose": "Exports the 'Checker' class from the local 'checker' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code merely defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies or suspicious patterns; straightforward module export.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named 'Checker' from a local module and makes it available for import elsewhere by defining '__all__'. There are no embedded or external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no indications of malicious behavior. The structure is simple and standard for Python modules intended to re-export specific classes or functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving solely as an explicit export of a class from a local module. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks are evident.",
