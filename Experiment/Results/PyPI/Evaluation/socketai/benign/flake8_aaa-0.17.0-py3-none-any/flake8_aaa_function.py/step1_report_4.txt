{
  "purpose": "This source code defines a class for analyzing and marking sections of a Python test function for a custom testing framework, including handling Act, Arrange, and Assert blocks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the input AST node (function definition), file lines, and token list. It also inspects tokens to identify comments, blank lines, and function structure.",
  "sinks": "The code updates internal line markers and constructs AST nodes, but does not execute untrusted code, write to external systems, or handle untrusted data sources directly.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves parsing the function AST node, analyzing tokens to mark lines, building Act nodes and blocks, and updating line markers accordingly. No data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No code that performs network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. Use of assertions for control flow is standard for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically processes a function AST, tokens, and lines to identify structure and mark sections relevant to a testing framework. No malicious behavior, such as executing untrusted data or network activities, is present. The code uses standard Python features and libraries without obfuscation or suspicious constructs. The overall logic is consistent with a test analysis utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for analyzing Python test functions, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It does not perform any harmful operations or malicious data handling. The security risk is minimal.",
