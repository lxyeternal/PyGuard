  "purpose": "Static analysis utility for Python test functions, identifying code sections (arrange, act, assert), comments, and blank lines, and validating structure.",
  "sources": "AST nodes, source lines, tokens, and line markers within the test function.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network, or untrusted input processing; internal marking and validation only.",
  "flows": "From AST nodes and tokens to line markers; validation errors raised for structural issues.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis on test functions, marking lines based on tokens and AST nodes, raising validation errors for structural issues like multiple or missing act blocks. It does not execute or handle untrusted data, nor does it perform network or file I/O. The logic is clear, well-structured, and uses standard modules. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The security implications are minimal, and the code's purpose is to improve test code quality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured static analysis utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate, though a risk score of 0 would be more precise given the benign nature. Overall, it poses no security threat and functions as intended.",
