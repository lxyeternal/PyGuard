  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured static analysis utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate, though a risk score of 0 would be more precise given the benign nature. Overall, it poses no security threat and functions as intended."
