{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes and data structures for handling errors related to code analysis, configuration validation, and internal state management.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are read; the code only defines classes and functions without any input handling or data parsing.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data outputs that could leak or act maliciously; the code does not perform any I/O or external network communication.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily involves exception handling and data encapsulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions and data structures used in static analysis or code validation processes. It includes standard practice for defining exception hierarchies and message formatting. There are no external inputs, network communications, or runtime behaviors that could be malicious. The code appears to be purely structural and utility in nature.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign set of class definitions for error handling and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as part of a larger static analysis framework without introducing security vulnerabilities.",
