  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and data structures for handling errors and validation issues in a flake8 plugin or checker.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from exception attributes and class parameters, primarily for error reporting and validation.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes data or executes untrusted input; it only constructs exception objects and error reports.",
  "flows": "Input data (error details) flows into exception instances and error report objects but does not lead to any insecure actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code strictly defines data containers and error handling logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines various exception and data classes to handle errors related to a flake8 plugin or checker system. There are no operations involving external input processing, network communication, or execution of untrusted code. The class methods are used solely for packaging error information for reporting purposes. No malicious or suspicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, is evident. The code appears to be standard, well-structured error handling code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical error reporting structure for a Python static analysis tool, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
