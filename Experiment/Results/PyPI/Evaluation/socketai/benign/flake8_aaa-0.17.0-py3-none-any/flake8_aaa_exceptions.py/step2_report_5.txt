  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes and data structures for error handling in static analysis. No external input, network activity, or obfuscation. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is purely structural, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The report's scores are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard exception classes for a code validation tool. No external data handling or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No hidden behaviors or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The scores are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines utility classes for error reporting in a linter or static analysis tool. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The only minor note is the use of `flatten_list`, but it's a utility function for formatting, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard exception and data classes for error handling. No suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is valid. No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, defines error handling classes for a static analysis plugin. No external input or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The scores are justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural, defining exception classes and data containers for error reporting.\n- **Malware, Obfuscation, Risk:** All reports assign zero scores, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Potential for Malicious Behavior:** None detected or implied. The code does not perform any I/O, network communication, dynamic code execution, or contain obfuscated patterns.\n- **Assumptions:** No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is consistent and cautious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n\nThe code is safe, benign, and standard for error handling in static analysis tools.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and consistent.
