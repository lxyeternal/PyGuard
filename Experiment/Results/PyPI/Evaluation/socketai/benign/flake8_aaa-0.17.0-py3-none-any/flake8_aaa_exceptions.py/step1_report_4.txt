{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes and data structures used for handling errors and validation in a Python linter or checker tool, specifically for Flake8 and AAA (possibly a custom analysis tool). It does not perform any functional logic beyond error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only class and exception definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; only string formatting in __str__ method and data encapsulation.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily used for error reporting.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code structure and content are typical for error handling classes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of class definitions for error and exception handling in a static analysis context. No dynamic data processing, network calls, or other suspicious behavior. The only potential concern is the use of 'flatten_list' in the string representation, but this is a utility function likely safe and used for formatting. No malicious code or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as part of an error reporting framework for a Python static analysis tool. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
