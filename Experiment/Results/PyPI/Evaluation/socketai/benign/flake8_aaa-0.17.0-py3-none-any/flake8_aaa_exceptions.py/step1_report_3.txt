{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and data structures for handling errors and validation issues within a larger Python codebase, likely related to code quality checks (e.g., flake8 plugin).",
  "sources": "No input data sources; the code only defines classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into potentially harmful operations; the code only constructs data objects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code focuses on error handling and message formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the code is straightforward class and exception definitions with no hidden or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for error handling and configuration validation, including custom exceptions and data structures. It includes string formatting for error messages and standard class inheritance. There are no network operations, data leaks, dynamic code execution, or other malicious patterns. The presence of helper functions like 'flatten_list' is noted, but their implementation isn't provided, and they are used solely for formatting purposes. Overall, the code appears to be a benign component of a code analysis or linter tool, with no signs of malicious intent or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility classes for error handling in a code quality checking context. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious activities detected.",
