{
  "purpose": "Define exception classes and data structures for error reporting in static analysis tools.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and string formatting methods, notably the use of 'flatten_list' in __str__ methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no external input, network communication, or data processing beyond object creation and message formatting.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of error objects -> conversion to string messages or error reports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'flatten_list' without its implementation; no other unusual code patterns or behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions and error data containers used in static analysis or linting frameworks. It does not perform any external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The only external function called is 'flatten_list', used for formatting error messages, which is unlikely to introduce security risks. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and standard for its purpose. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, serving as error reporting utilities within a static analysis framework. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated logic, and the scoring is justified. The reports are accurate and do not require modifications.",
