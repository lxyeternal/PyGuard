{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and data structures for handling errors and validation within a code quality checker or linter tool.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing and local helpers; class attribute assignments and method parameters",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, external system calls, or sensitive data exposure observed",
  "flows": "Input data (error details) passed into exception constructors, then transformed into error objects or messages",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Exception handling appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exceptions and data classes for error reporting, including detailed error info for use in flake8 plugins or similar tools. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or malicious logic detected. The presence of exception classes and string formatting for error messages is typical for validation frameworks. No suspicious flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a validation/error reporting module in a Python code analysis tool. It contains no malicious behavior, no evidence of sabotage, and no security risks. It functions solely to define data structures and exception handling.",
