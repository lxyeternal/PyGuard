  "purpose": "AST utility to identify and map the first child node of each 'with' statement to its parent node for structural analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads 'ast.With' nodes and their 'body' attribute during AST traversal.",
  "sinks": "None; operates solely on AST data without external data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Traverses AST, records first statement in 'with' body, maps to parent node.",
  "anomalies": "Assumes 'node.body' is non-empty; potential IndexError if 'body' is empty, but unlikely in typical ASTs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'FirstChildFinder' extending 'ast.NodeVisitor' to map each 'with' node's first child to its parent. It visits 'With' nodes, records the first statement in 'body', and recursively visits all children. The wrapper function applies this visitor to an AST. No malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage is present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The only minor edge case is the assumption that 'body' is non-empty, which does not impact security but could be improved for robustness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured AST utility for structural analysis of Python code. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
