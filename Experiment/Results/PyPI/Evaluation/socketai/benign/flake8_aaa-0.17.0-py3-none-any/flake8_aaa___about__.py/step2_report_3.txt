  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple variable assignments for package metadata.\n- No dynamic code, external input, or execution is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- All reports assign static strings to module-level variables, typical for Python package setup files.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious activity.\n\n### Logical and reasoning flaws:\n- **Accuracy of conclusions:** The reports correctly identify the code as metadata declarations with no security concerns.\n- **Potential overestimation:** None. The assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, justified given the benign nature.\n\n### Risk scores:\n- Since all reports confidently conclude no security issues, the overall risk score should be **0**.\n\n### Malware considerations:\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious intent are present.\n- The use of f-strings is static; no dynamic or external data is involved.\n- The code does not process untrusted input or perform any dangerous operations.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as standard metadata.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made; the analysis is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n## Final assessment:\n\n| Score Type          | Recommended Value | Justification                                                                 |\n|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware             | 0                   | No malicious activity detected; code is static metadata assignment.        |\n| Obfuscated          | 0                   | No obfuscation observed; code is straightforward.                            |\n| Security Risk       | 0                   | No vulnerabilities or security issues identified.                           |\n\n---\n\n## Additional notes:\n- The overall security posture of this code is very low risk.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no changes needed.\n- The code appears to be a standard, benign package metadata declaration with no security implications.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- **Your estimated scores should be:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
