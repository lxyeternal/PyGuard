  "purpose": "Define package metadata for a Flake8 plugin that enforces the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in tests.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements defining string variables for package name, version, author, copyright, description, and email.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; code does not process external input or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no malicious data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code consists solely of metadata declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, assigning string literals to module-level variables representing package metadata. No external input handling, dynamic code execution, or secret handling is present. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation are observed. The structure and content are typical for Python package metadata definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to specify package information. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
