  "sources": "Assignment statements defining string variables (__short_name__, __iam__, __version__, __author__, __copyright__, __description__, __email__)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data influences system behavior or causes data leaks.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from sources to sinks; the code only sets static string values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; all code consists of straightforward variable assignments with static strings.",
  "analysis": "The code sets metadata variables for a plugin, using simple string assignments and f-strings with static content. There are no dynamic or external inputs, no code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The code appears to be standard package metadata setup with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only static metadata definitions for a plugin. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks detected.",
