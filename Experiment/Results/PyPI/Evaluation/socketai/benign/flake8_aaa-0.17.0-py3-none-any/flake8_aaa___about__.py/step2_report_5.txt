  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports describe the code as simple variable assignments defining package metadata for a Python project, specifically a Flake8 plugin. They consistently identify no untrusted data handling, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code is straightforward, with no evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or obfuscation.\n- No dynamic code execution, no external input handling, and no sensitive data present.\n- The use of f-strings is static, as all involved variables are constants.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, and the reported scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Flaws or Concerns:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct given the code. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** All are 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely metadata declaration with no dynamic or external data handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or vulnerabilities.\n- The consistent, low scores reflect the benign nature accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Personal Estimate:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThese match the reports' assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, with no security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
