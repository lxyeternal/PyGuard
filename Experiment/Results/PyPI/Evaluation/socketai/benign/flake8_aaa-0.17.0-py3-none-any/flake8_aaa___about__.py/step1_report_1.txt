  "sources": "Reading of string and f-string assignments, including author and version info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; simple variable assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated patterns observed; straightforward metadata declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata using simple string assignments and f-strings. There are no input handling, no external data processing, and no execution of dynamic code. It is a standard pattern for defining package info. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign and typical package metadata declaration with no malicious intent or security issues.",
