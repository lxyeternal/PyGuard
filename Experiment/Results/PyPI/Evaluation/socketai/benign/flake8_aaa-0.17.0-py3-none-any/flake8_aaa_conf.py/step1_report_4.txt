  "purpose": "Define configuration settings and parsing logic for a plugin, likely related to a code quality tool, using enums and dataclasses.",
  "sources": "Reading command line options via argparse.Namespace for 'aaa_act_block_style'.",
  "sinks": "Conversion of input string 'aaa_act_block_style' into enum, and potential raising of UnexpectedConfigValue exception.",
  "flows": "Input 'aaa_act_block_style' -> Parsing in load_options() -> Enum lookup -> Exception handling if invalid.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, no obfuscation. Exception handling is standard. No suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines enum and dataclass for configuration. It safely parses a string input into an enum, raising a custom exception if invalid. No malicious logic, data exfiltration, or backdoors present. The exception handling is straightforward and does not involve unsafe practices. Usage of standard libraries and type hints are typical. No indications of obfuscation or malware. Overall, the code appears clean and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration parser with safe enum handling and exception raising. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It primarily manages user-provided options without executing any unsafe operations.",
