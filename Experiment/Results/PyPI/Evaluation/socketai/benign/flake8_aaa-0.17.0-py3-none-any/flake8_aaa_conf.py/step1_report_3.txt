  "purpose": "Defines configuration data structures and methods for handling act_block_style options, including default and custom loading via argparse.",
  "sources": "Reading options.aaa_act_block_style from argparse.Namespace",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises UnexpectedConfigValue exception if invalid input is provided",
  "flows": "Input options.aaa_act_block_style -> load_options() -> act_block_style in Config",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials. No code injection or obfuscated code. Use of enum and dataclasses appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a configuration class with default options and a loader that parses an argparse namespace. It handles validation by attempting to access enum members by name, raising an exception if invalid. No untrusted data flows into dangerous system calls or network operations. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present. The only notable behavior is validation of user input against enum values, which is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration handling module with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It validates user input properly and raises exceptions for invalid options. No security issues or malicious intent detected.",
