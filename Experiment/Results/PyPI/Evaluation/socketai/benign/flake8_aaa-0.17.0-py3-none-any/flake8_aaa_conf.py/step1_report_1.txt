  "purpose": "Define configuration handling for a plugin or tool, including reading options and setting defaults.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from 'options.aaa_act_block_style' (an argparse.Namespace object).",
  "sinks": "The code processes the input to produce a Config object; no data is written to external systems or leaked.",
  "flows": "Input from 'options.aaa_act_block_style' flows through the load_options method, which parses and validates it, then creates a Config instance.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Usage of enum for controlled values. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data structures and methods for configuration management. It reads a single input value from an argparse.Namespace object, validates it against predefined enum values, and constructs a Config object. No external data sources, network activity, or system modifications are present. The exception handling for invalid input is standard and safe. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a safe configuration loader with validation. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The code appears benign and appropriate for its purpose.",
