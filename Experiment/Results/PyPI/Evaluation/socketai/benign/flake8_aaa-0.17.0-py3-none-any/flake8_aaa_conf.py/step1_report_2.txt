{
  "purpose": "The code defines configuration handling for a plugin, including enumerations and loading options from command line arguments.",
  "sources": "The code reads command line arguments via 'argparse.Namespace', specifically the attribute 'aaa_act_block_style'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data directly leads to data leaks or system effects. The only usage involves enum lookup and exception raising.",
  "flows": "Input from 'options.aaa_act_block_style' flows through the Enum lookup, which could raise an exception if invalid. No dangerous flows or command execution paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or unusual code behavior are detected. Usage of enum for input validation is standard. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a configuration class with default and loading methods. It safely parses an enum value from user input, raising a custom exception for invalid values. There are no external system calls, network activities, or hidden behaviors. The logic is straightforward and typical for config handling. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration parser with validation via enums. It performs no malicious actions and appears secure and well-structured. No evidence of malware or security issues was found.",
