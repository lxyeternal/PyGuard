{
  "purpose": "This code defines configuration management for a plugin, including enum options, default settings, and loading options from command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from command-line arguments via the 'options' parameter in load_options().",
  "sinks": "The 'options.aaa_act_block_style' value is used to determine the enum variant, which influences internal configuration; no data is directly written or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line options flows into enum parsing, which sets configuration values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly defines an enum and a dataclass for configuration, with methods to load defaults and parse options from argparse.Namespace. It validates input against allowed enum values, raising exceptions on invalid input. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are evident; no external data transmissions or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration handling module with input validation, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
