{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and classes for analyzing Python test files, identifying test functions, detecting specific test-related code patterns, and processing AST nodes for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading filenames (via os.path.basename), reading lines of code (via line parameter in functions), and parsing AST nodes for function definitions, statements, and tokens.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data processing are present; the code mostly reads and analyzes AST nodes and code lines without executing or manipulating untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "The code reads file names and lines, parses AST, processes tokens, and identifies specific code patterns or constructs, such as test functions, context managers, or no-op functions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Usage of regex, tokenization, and AST analysis appears benign and solely for code inspection purposes. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors detected. The code relies on standard libraries and functions for static code analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis of Python source files, particularly test files, using AST and tokenization. It identifies test functions, checks for context managers related to pytest and unittest, detects no-op functions, and filters code nodes based on line numbers. No code executes untrusted input, manipulates environment variables insecurely, or performs network operations. All functions operate purely on static code structures, and there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static analysis utility for test code detection and pattern recognition. It does not contain malicious behavior, malicious payloads, or supply chain threats. It is well-structured for its intended purpose and does not exhibit any security risks or malware indicators.",
