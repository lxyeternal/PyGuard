  "purpose": "Static analysis utility functions for Python test files, functions, and code patterns, primarily for identifying test functions, context managers, and no-op functions.",
  "sources": "Filename pattern matching, AST nodes for functions, context managers, assignments, and expressions, tokenization for comments.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Analysis of filename patterns and AST nodes to identify test functions, context managers, and no-op functions without executing or manipulating untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward static analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static analysis utility relying on regex, AST traversal, and tokenization. It does not execute untrusted code, access network, or handle sensitive data. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The functions serve to identify test functions, context managers, and no-op functions for testing or code quality purposes. The code is well-structured, with clear comments and no malicious intent. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility with no malicious payloads, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly assess its safety, and the scores should be set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.",
