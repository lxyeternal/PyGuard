  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a parser for code blocks within test functions, with no external input, no sinks, flows, or anomalies. It focuses on AST node processing, span calculation, and block building.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no obfuscation. The logic is straightforward and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a standard implementation for parsing code blocks, with no suspicious activity or external interactions.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. It’s a typical static analysis utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct; the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a code parser for test blocks, with no external data, no malicious patterns, and no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis emphasizes the absence of malicious behavior and external effects.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0 — consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report’s conclusion aligns with the code’s nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the structure and parsing logic, with no external interactions or malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, describing a static parser for test code blocks, with no external data handling or suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious or malicious-like behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0, Risk = 0.0 — consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The analysis is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify any actual issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors in the code.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.0, as the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward; no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the above, a risk score of 0.0 is appropriate across all reports.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Note:** The code is a static analysis utility for parsing test code blocks, which is inherently safe. There are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate; the code is benign and poses no security threat. The scores assigned are reasonable and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
