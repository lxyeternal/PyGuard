{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for parsing and representing code blocks within test functions, specifically focusing on arranging, acting, and asserting code segments.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.conf, .exceptions, .helpers, .types, .visitors); function parameters; class attributes; method inputs such as 'node' and 'test_func_node'.",
  "sinks": "No use of untrusted input directly affecting sensitive operations; no data leaks, network operations, or command executions are present.",
  "flows": "No evident source-to-sink data flows that could lead to malicious outcomes; the code primarily processes AST nodes and manages internal data structures.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for a parsing utility, with no suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated constructs. The only noteworthy aspect is the manipulation of AST nodes, which is typical in code analysis tools.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'Block' class used to model code segments within test functions, with methods for building 'act' and 'arrange' blocks based on AST nodes. It uses external helper functions to determine spans and process AST nodes, but does not execute any external commands, network operations, or handle untrusted input in a manner that could cause harm. The logic is straightforward, focusing on code structure analysis without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of code block parsing within test functions, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and focused solely on static code analysis, with no harmful behavior detected.",
