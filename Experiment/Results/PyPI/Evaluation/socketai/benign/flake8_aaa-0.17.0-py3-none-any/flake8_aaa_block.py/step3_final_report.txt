{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for parsing and managing code blocks (Arrange, Act, Assert) within test functions based on AST nodes, focusing on span calculation and block construction.",
  "sources": "AST nodes representing code statements and helper functions for span and token extraction.",
  "sinks": "None; internal processing without external data flow or external input handling.",
  "flows": "AST nodes to span calculations and block attribute assignments; no external data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static utility for parsing code blocks in test functions, utilizing AST nodes and helper functions for span determination. It does not execute external code, handle untrusted input, or perform network operations. The logic is straightforward, with assertions ensuring valid input, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code's purpose is structural analysis, not dynamic execution or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured static analysis utility for test code blocks, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks present.",
