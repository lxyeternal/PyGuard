{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Block class for parsing and representing code blocks (Arrange, Act, Assert) in test functions, along with helper functions for span calculation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from AST nodes, function parameters, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that could lead to data leaks, code injection, or malicious actions. No external data is processed or sent.",
  "flows": "The flow involves constructing Block instances from AST nodes, determining span lines based on AST tokens, and building blocks depending on node types and styles.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation are present. The code strictly manages code structure and span calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for parsing code blocks from AST nodes. It includes class methods to build blocks based on node types and styles, as well as helper functions to determine line spans. It relies on external modules for filtering nodes and obtaining tokens. There is no indication of data manipulation, network communication, or malicious behavior. The overall structure appears to be part of a testing framework or code analysis tool, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign utility module for parsing and managing code blocks within a test framework. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present. The code is safe and its purpose is purely structural analysis.",
