  "purpose": "Define type annotations for URL and Email using marshmallow fields, with conditional import based on Python version.",
  "sources": "Import statements from sys, marshmallow.fields, and typing modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; straightforward type aliasing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys for version checking, marshmallow.fields for data validation fields, and typing or typing_extensions for the Annotated type. It conditionally imports Annotated based on Python version >= 3.9. It then creates type aliases for URL and Email with marshmallow validation fields. There are no data processing, input handling, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, version-aware setup for defining annotated types for URL and Email validation using marshmallow. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
