  "purpose": "Define type aliases for URL and Email using marshmallow validation fields, with compatibility for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, marshmallow.fields, and typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward type alias definitions with version-based import logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports system version info and marshmallow validation fields. It then conditionally imports Annotated from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version. It defines type aliases Url and Email with marshmallow field validators, and an alias URL for Url. There is no data processing, input handling, or security-sensitive operation involved. The code appears to be a simple, benign type alias setup for data validation purposes, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup for type annotations using marshmallow validators, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
