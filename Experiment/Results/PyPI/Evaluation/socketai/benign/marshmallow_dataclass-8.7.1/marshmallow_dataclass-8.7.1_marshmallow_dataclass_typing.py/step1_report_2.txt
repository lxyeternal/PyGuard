  "purpose": "Define type aliases for URL and Email with validation annotations using marshmallow fields, with conditional import for compatibility with different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reading the sys.version_info to determine Python version; importing marshmallow.fields; importing typing.Annotated or typing_extensions.Annotated; defining Url and Email type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or user input processing present; no sinks detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only sets up type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import and alias definitions; no hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version to import the appropriate Annotated type for type annotations. It then defines two type aliases, Url and Email, annotated with marshmallow validation fields. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no sensitive data handling. The code appears to serve as a type annotation utility within a larger codebase, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple compatibility utility for defining validated URL and Email types. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and poses no security risks.",
