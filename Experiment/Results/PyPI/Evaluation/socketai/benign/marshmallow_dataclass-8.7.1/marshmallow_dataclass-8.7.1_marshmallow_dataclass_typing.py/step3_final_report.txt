  "purpose": "Define type aliases for URL and Email with marshmallow validation fields, ensuring compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.version_info check, marshmallow.fields usage",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data flow operations",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data handling present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version check and type alias definitions",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Annotated' based on Python version, then defines 'Url' and 'Email' as annotated types with marshmallow validation fields. It also creates an alias 'URL' for 'Url'. There are no data processing, external calls, or suspicious patterns. The code serves as a utility for type annotations, with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for type annotations with marshmallow validation. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, security risk score of 0, and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's function.",
