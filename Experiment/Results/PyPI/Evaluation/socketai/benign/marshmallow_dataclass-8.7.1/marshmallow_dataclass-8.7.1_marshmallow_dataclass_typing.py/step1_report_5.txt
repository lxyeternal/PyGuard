  "purpose": "Define type annotations for URL and Email strings using marshmallow fields with support for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version detection, marshmallow.fields for validation fields",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data processing or output",
  "flows": "No data flow involving input or untrusted sources; the code only sets up type annotations",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version to conditionally import 'Annotated' for type annotations. It then defines 'Url' and 'Email' as annotated string types validated by marshmallow fields. An alias 'URL' is also created. All operations are straightforward type definitions with no data processing or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues, and the code appears to serve a utility purpose for type hinting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and purely for defining annotated types for URL and Email strings, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
