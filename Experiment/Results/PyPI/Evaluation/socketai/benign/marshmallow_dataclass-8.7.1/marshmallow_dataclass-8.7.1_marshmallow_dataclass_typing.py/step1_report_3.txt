  "purpose": "Define type annotations for URL and Email using marshmallow validation fields, with compatibility for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports modules and defines type aliases.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink occurs; the code is purely defining type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and does not include any suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, checks Python version for conditional import of Annotated, and defines type aliases for URL and Email with marshmallow validation fields. No external input, environment variables, or untrusted data is involved. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The code appears to be part of a larger validation schema setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module for type annotations and schema validation. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
