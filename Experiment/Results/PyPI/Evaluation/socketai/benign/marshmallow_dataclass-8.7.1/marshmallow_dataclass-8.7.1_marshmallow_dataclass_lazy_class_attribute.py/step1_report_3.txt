{
  "purpose": "Implement a descriptor class for a class-level, cacheable, read-only property that computes its value once and caches it on the class.",
  "sources": "The constructor (__init__) method sets up the function to be called; the __get__ method retrieves or computes and caches the attribute value; the __set_name__ method assigns the attribute name.",
  "sinks": "The __get__ method calls the stored function (func) which may potentially contain untrusted code if the function is user-provided; setattr is used to cache the computed value on the class.",
  "flows": "During first access, __get__ calls self.func() to compute value, then caches it on the class via setattr; subsequent calls return the cached value without recomputation.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and typical for a descriptor pattern. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The 'called' flag prevents recursion but could lead to incorrect caching if used improperly; however, this is standard behavior for such a pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a descriptor class that allows a class attribute to be lazily computed once and then stored. It uses __slots__ to optimize memory. The __get__ method ensures the function is called only once per class, caching the result. No external input, network calls, or file operations are present. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks; the function executed (func) is user-defined and could be arbitrary, but this is expected behavior for a decorator pattern. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs. Overall, the implementation is typical and safe assuming the function provided is trusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a class-level lazy property descriptor without any malicious intent or security risks. It safely caches computed values and does not perform any suspicious activities. No malware or security issues are identified.",
