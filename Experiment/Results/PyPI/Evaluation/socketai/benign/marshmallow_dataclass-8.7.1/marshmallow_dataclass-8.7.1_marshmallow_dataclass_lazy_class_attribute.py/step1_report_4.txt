  "purpose": "Define a descriptor class for creating class-level, cached, read-only attributes with lazy evaluation.",
  "sources": "Input to __init__ (func, name, forward_value), class context in __get__ and __set_name__.",
  "sinks": "Attribute setting on class in __get__ (setattr), potentially exposing internal function results.",
  "flows": "Function passed to __init__ is called during first __get__, results stored on class, subsequent access returns cached value.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. Use of setattr and getattr is standard for such descriptors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a descriptor LazyClassAttribute that caches the result of a function as a class attribute upon first access. The __get__ method calls the provided function once, stores the result on the class, and returns it on subsequent calls. The class is designed to be a lazy, read-only property at the class level. There are no external inputs, no network or file I/O, and no suspicious code patterns. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a standard lazy-loading class attribute descriptor with caching. It does not contain malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign utility class.",
