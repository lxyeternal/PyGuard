{
  "purpose": "Defines a descriptor class LazyClassAttribute that implements a lazy, cached, class-level property mechanism.",
  "sources": "Uses the __init__, __get__, and __set_name__ methods to initialize and access class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points leading to data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input occurs during attribute access (__get__), flow is within the class to cache and retrieve values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The class simply implements a lazy caching pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a descriptor for lazy evaluation and caching at the class level. It avoids recursion by using a called flag and sets the computed value as a class attribute. The use of setattr and getattr is standard for descriptors. No external data sources, external outputs, or malicious constructs are present. The design is straightforward and does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a class-level lazy property decorator with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
