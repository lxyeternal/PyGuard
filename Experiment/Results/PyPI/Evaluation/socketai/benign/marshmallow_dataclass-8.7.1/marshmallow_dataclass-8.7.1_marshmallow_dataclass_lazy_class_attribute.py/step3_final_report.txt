{
  "purpose": "Implement a class-level, read-only, lazily evaluated property that caches its result on the class.",
  "sources": "The function 'func' executed during __get__, which is user-supplied; attribute name set via __set_name__.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'self.func()' which executes user-provided code; no other data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Accessing the descriptor triggers __get__, which calls 'self.func()', caches the result on the class, and returns it.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'called' flag as an instance attribute may cause caching issues if multiple attributes use this descriptor; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a descriptor for class-level lazy evaluation, caching the result after first call. It uses standard Python features with no external data sources or malicious patterns. The 'called' flag prevents recursion but may interfere with multiple uses. The 'func' can be arbitrary, which could be risky if untrusted, but this is inherent in such patterns. No obfuscation or malware indicators are present. The scores in reports are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with only a minimal security concern if 'func' is untrusted. Overall, the implementation is safe, straightforward, and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for class-level caching with no malicious intent or security issues. The potential risk from executing 'func' depends on external trust, not the code itself. Scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent.",
