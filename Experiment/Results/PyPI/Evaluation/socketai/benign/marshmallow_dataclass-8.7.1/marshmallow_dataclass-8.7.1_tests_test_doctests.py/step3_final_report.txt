  "purpose": "Load doctests from the marshmallow_dataclass module into a test suite for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Importing doctest and marshmallow_dataclass modules; reading from marshmallow_dataclass for doctests.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no network operations, no data leaks, no external inputs or outputs.",
  "flows": "The function adds doctests from marshmallow_dataclass to the test suite via tests.addTests(doctest.DocTestSuite(marshmallow_dataclass)).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing modules and a third-party library, then defines a function to add doctests from that library into a test suite. It performs no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), and no obfuscation or malicious intent is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test setup function with no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
