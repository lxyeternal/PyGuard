{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to load doctests from the marshmallow_dataclass module into a test suite.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'doctest' and 'marshmallow_dataclass'; the 'load_tests' function reading parameters '_loader', 'tests', '_ignore'.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data output or external connections.",
  "flows": "The function takes a test suite, adds doctests from 'marshmallow_dataclass' to it, then returns the suite.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward use of testing utilities with no suspicious logic or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing modules and defines a simple function to include doctests from 'marshmallow_dataclass'. There is no indication of reading external inputs, executing untrusted code, or performing any malicious activity. The function merely modifies a test suite with existing, trusted testing functions. The overall structure is typical for test setup and contains no hidden or obfuscated behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to incorporate doctests into a test suite for 'marshmallow_dataclass'. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
