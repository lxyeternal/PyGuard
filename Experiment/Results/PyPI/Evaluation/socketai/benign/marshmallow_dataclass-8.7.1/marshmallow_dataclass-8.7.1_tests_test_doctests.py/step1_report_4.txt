  "purpose": "The code is designed to load doctests from the 'marshmallow_dataclass' module for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'marshmallow_dataclass' module for testing.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "The code imports a module and adds its doctests to a test suite; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior are evident; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing libraries and a third-party module, then adds doctests from that module to a test suite. There is no input/output handling of untrusted data, nor any network or file operations that could be malicious. The code appears straightforward and typical for test setup, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple test setup for 'marshmallow_dataclass' with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and standard practice.",
