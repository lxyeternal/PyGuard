  "purpose": "The code loads doctests from the marshmallow_dataclass module for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for doctest and marshmallow_dataclass, and the load_tests function which reads input from the module and parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not handle untrusted input or data sinks.",
  "flows": "No significant data flows involving untrusted data; the code simply adds tests from a module to a test suite.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing modules and defines a function to add doctests from the marshmallow_dataclass module into a test suite. It is a standard test loader pattern without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward test setup for loading doctests from a module, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
