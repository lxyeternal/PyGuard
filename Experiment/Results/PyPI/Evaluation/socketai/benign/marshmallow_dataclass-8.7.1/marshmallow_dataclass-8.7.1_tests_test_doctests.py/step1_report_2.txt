  "purpose": "The code loads and adds doctests from the marshmallow_dataclass module for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the marshmallow_dataclass module and the doctest framework.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input from the marshmallow_dataclass module flows into doctest.DocTestSuite, which runs tests.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to add doctests from a specific module to a test suite. It imports only standard and known third-party libraries. The function does not process untrusted input or perform network operations. It appears to be standard testing setup code without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing utility for loading doctests from a module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and typical for test setup.",
