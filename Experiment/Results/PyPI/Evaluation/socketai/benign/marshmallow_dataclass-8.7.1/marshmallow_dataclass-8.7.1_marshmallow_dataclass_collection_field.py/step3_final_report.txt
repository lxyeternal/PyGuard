{
  "purpose": "Defines custom marshmallow fields for immutable data structures (Sequence as tuple, Set as set or frozenset) during deserialization.",
  "sources": "Input data passed to _deserialize method (value, attr, data).",
  "sinks": "Deserialized immutable collections returned; no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input data -> _deserialize -> conversion to tuple/set/frozenset -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data transformation, no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code extends marshmallow's List field to produce immutable collections, overriding _deserialize to convert lists into tuples or set/frozenset. No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are involved. The implementation is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The logic is simple and safe, performing internal data conversions. No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0-0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The slight variation in risk scores reflects minimal concern, but overall, the code is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of custom marshmallow fields for immutable data structures. No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation are present. The scores assigned are accurate and justified based on the analysis.",
