{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom marshmallow fields for handling immutable sequences and sets during serialization/deserialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads data during deserialization via the _deserialize methods of the custom fields.",
  "sinks": "The deserialized data is returned as immutable collections (tuple, frozenset/set), but there are no explicit sinks that send data elsewhere or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Input data -> _deserialize method -> converting list to tuple or set -> returned value.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no external network calls, no suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard library and marshmallow methods without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code extends marshmallow's List field to create Sequence (immutable list/tuple) and Set (unordered collection) types. The _deserialize methods convert the input list into immutable collections, which is a common pattern for data integrity. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The code's purpose appears solely to enforce data structure constraints during serialization/deserialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard, safe customization of marshmallow fields for immutable collections. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It simply enhances data validation and structure enforcement.",
