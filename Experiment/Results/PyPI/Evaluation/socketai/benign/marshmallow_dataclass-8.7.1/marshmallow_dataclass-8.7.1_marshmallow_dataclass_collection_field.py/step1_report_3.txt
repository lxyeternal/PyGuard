{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom marshmallow field classes for deserializing sequences and sets, providing immutable and immutable-unordered collection options.",
  "sources": "The code reads data during deserialization in the _deserialize methods of the custom fields.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data into sensitive operations or outputs.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the provided value parameter into the superclass _deserialize method, then into the custom _deserialize methods, resulting in either a tuple or a set/frozenset.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscated logic; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code extends marshmallow.fields.List to create Sequence and Set classes with custom deserialization logic. Sequence converts lists to tuples, and Set converts lists to set or frozenset, depending on configuration. There are no external inputs, environment variables, or network operations. No malicious patterns such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The code does not interact with external systems or perform any dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom marshmallow fields for immutable collections, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
