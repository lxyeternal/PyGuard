  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, extending marshmallow fields to produce immutable collections during deserialization.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The only slight concern is the \"securityRisk\" scores of 0.1 in some reports, which seem to be an overestimation given the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly overrides `_deserialize` to convert lists into tuples or set/frozenset. No issues in logic.\n- **Malicious intent:** None. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** The code performs safe data transformations; potential vulnerabilities depend on how deserialized data is used downstream, which is outside this code's scope.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk scores:** The scores of 0.1 seem unjustified given the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** The scores are mostly 0 or 0.1. Given the code's benign nature, a risk score of 0.0 or very close to it would be more appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious or dangerous operations.\n- The minimal \"securityRisk\" scores of 0.1 are overestimations; they should be 0.\n- The malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n- The obfuscated score remains 0, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and does not pose any security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. The only adjustment needed is to set the `securityRisk` scores to 0, reflecting the actual safety of the code.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
