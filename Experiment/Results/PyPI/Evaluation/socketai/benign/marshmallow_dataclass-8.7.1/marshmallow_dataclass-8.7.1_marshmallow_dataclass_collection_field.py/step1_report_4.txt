{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom marshmallow fields for sequence and set data types, providing immutable and immutable set options for data serialization/deserialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads data during deserialization in the _deserialize methods, which process input values.",
  "sinks": "The deserialized data is returned as tuples, sets, or frozensets; no direct output sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data -> _deserialize methods -> processed into tuple or set/frozenset structures; no further data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code solely defines data type transformations.",
  "analysis": "The code extends marshmallow fields to create custom sequence and set types, mainly converting lists into immutable tuples or sets during deserialization. No external data sources, network activity, or system modifications are evident. The logic is straightforward, handling data transformations securely. No unusual or obfuscated code features are detected. The design appears standard for data validation schemas.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign extension of marshmallow serialization fields for immutable collections. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
