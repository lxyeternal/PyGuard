  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code content.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package.\n- No dynamic code execution, network calls, or processing of untrusted input is present.\n- The code only reads a static README.md file for the long description.\n- Dependencies are explicitly listed and standard.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly identifies static configuration.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as above, consistent and accurate.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), justified by reading an external file, but this is standard practice.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable, given the minimal risk from reading a file.\n\n**Report 4 & 5:**\n- Similar assessments, confirming no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Are any issues present?**  \n  No. The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. All reports assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, which aligns with the code content. The small securityRisk in report 3 is justified by the external file read, but it's not malicious.\n\n- **Any claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All assessments are consistent with the code's static and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Note:** The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package. No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent with the code. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
