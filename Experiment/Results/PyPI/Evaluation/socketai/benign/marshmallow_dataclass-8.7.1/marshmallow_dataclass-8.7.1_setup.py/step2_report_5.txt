  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details and the context.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states that the code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. It correctly notes that the script reads static data, imports from setuptools, and does not process untrusted input.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are evident. The confidence is high, and the assessment aligns with the code content.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the script is standard, reads a static README.md, and does not involve dynamic code or untrusted data.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Evaluation:** The conclusion is consistent with the code. No issues are detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the analysis finds no suspicious behavior. However, it assigns a **securityRisk of 0.1**, citing the reading of an external file.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n- **Justification:** Reading a static README.md file during setup is standard practice and does not pose a security risk. The minor risk score seems unjustified; it's an accepted pattern in package setup scripts.\n- **Recommendation:** The risk score should remain at 0, as there's no actual security concern here.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, with no suspicious activity detected. It emphasizes the use of static data and standard practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Evaluation:** The reasoning is sound; no issues are present.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** The analysis concludes the script is standard, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Evaluation:** The conclusion aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is a standard setup script.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation is present; all code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** The only point of contention is Report 3's assignment of 0.1 for reading a README.md file. This is a common and benign practice in setup scripts.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (reading static files during setup is standard; no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The initial assessments are accurate. The only minor adjustment is to keep the security risk score at 0 for Report 3, as reading a README.md during setup does not constitute a security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nAll reports are consistent with the code's behavior. The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
