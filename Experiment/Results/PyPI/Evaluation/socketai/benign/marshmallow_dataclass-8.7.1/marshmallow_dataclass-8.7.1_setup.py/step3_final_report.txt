{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata and configuration for building and distributing the Python package 'marshmallow_dataclass'.",
  "sources": "Reads static data from 'README.md' for long description, imports from setuptools for package setup.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Static data (README.md) is read during setup; no dynamic or untrusted data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package, using standard practices. It reads a static README.md file, specifies dependencies, and sets package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or processing of untrusted input is observed. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, typical Python package setup file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal external file read (README.md) is standard and does not introduce any security concerns.",
