  "purpose": "Defines a custom marshmallow Field supporting union types with runtime type validation using typeguard.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to _serialize and _deserialize methods, and type validation via typeguard.check_type.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or errors if untrusted data is processed without proper validation, but no unsafe operations or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input into _serialize/_deserialize, passing through type validation, then serialization/deserialization functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected. Use of deepcopy is standard for schema binding.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard custom marshmallow field supporting multiple types with runtime validation via typeguard. It uses deepcopy to prevent shared state issues, handles errors appropriately, and maintains compatibility across typeguard versions. No malicious activity, external command execution, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The code's logic is straightforward and adheres to best practices, with no signs of obfuscation or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and safe. It performs data validation and serialization without malicious intent or security flaws. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The low security risk score of 0.1 reflects minimal concern, primarily due to handling untrusted data, which is inherent in such validation code but not harmful.",
