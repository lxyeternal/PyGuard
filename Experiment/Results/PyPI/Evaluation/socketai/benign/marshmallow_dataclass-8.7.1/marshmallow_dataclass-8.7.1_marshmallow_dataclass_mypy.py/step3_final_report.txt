{
  "purpose": "This code implements a MyPy plugin for marshmallow_dataclass, registering hooks for dynamic class creation and dataclass decoration during static type checking.",
  "sources": "It reads call expressions, inspects arguments (notably 'typ') via reflection, and modifies the symbol table accordingly.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects; the code only updates symbol tables during static analysis.",
  "flows": "Source is the call expression; flow involves extracting 'typ' argument and updating the symbol table if conditions are met.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; uses reflection safely for static analysis; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static analysis plugin that hooks into marshmallow_dataclass to handle NewType and dataclass decorators. It inspects call expressions, extracts the 'typ' argument using inspect.signature, and updates the symbol table with type info. There are no signs of malicious activity, network operations, or obfuscation. The use of reflection is limited to static analysis context, posing no runtime risk. The code's purpose is to assist static type checking, not to execute or exfiltrate data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured MyPy plugin with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs static analysis tasks safely, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is effectively 0, aligning with the analysis.",
