{
  "purpose": "This code provides a mypy plugin for handling marshmallow_dataclass-specific features, such as custom class creation and type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (inspect, typing, mypy, marshmallow_dataclass), functions that access call expressions and signatures.",
  "sinks": "Calls to add_symbol_table_node (potentially affecting symbol table), access to function call arguments, and use of inspect.signature for reflection.",
  "flows": "The plugin retrieves function argument values via reflection and modifies the symbol table during static analysis, primarily for type information handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code uses reflection and type inspection but does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a mypy plugin to handle marshmallow_dataclass features, specifically for custom types and class decorators. It uses inspect.signature to analyze function call arguments and modifies the symbol table accordingly. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data theft, or backdoors. The reflection and type handling appear to be legitimate static analysis techniques. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The functions are well-defined and focused on static type analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard mypy plugin extension for marshmallow_dataclass with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It performs type analysis and symbol table modifications as intended without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
