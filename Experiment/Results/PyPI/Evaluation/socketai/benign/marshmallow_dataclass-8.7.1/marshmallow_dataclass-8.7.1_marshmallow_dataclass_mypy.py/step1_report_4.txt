{
  "purpose": "The code is a plugin for mypy that provides dynamic class hooks for marshmallow_dataclass, enabling type checking and symbol table modifications during static analysis.",
  "sources": "Reading the function call expressions (call.args, call.arg_names), inspecting function signatures (inspect.signature), and accessing class info (nodes.RefExpr, nodes.TypeInfo).",
  "sinks": "Adding symbol table nodes via ctx.api.add_symbol_table_node; potential for modifying symbol tables based on untrusted data, but limited to static analysis context.",
  "flows": "Input from mypy's call expressions and type inspection flows into symbol table modification, which is purely static and analysis-based.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code performs standard static analysis procedures. No malicious code or privacy violations detected.",
  "analysis": "The plugin registers hooks for marshmallow_dataclass to enhance static type checking. It retrieves function argument types using inspect.signature and binds arguments for static analysis purposes. The logic is straightforward, focusing on type info extraction and symbol table updates during mypy's analysis. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling was found.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard mypy plugin designed to assist with marshmallow_dataclass static analysis. It performs no malicious actions, does not leak data, and is consistent with typical static analysis tooling. The risk of malicious intent is extremely low.",
