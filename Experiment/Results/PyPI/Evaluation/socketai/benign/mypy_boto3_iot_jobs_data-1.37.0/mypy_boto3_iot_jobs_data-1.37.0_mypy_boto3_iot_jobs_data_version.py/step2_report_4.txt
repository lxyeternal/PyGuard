  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. **Reports 1-5** all describe the same minimal code snippet: a static assignment of a version string (__version__ = \"1.37.0\") with a copyright notice. They consistently conclude that this is a standard, benign package metadata declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Code presence and correctness:**  \n   - The code is present and correctly assigns a version string to __version__.  \n   - No dynamic code, input handling, or external data processing is involved.  \n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or code injection.\n\n3. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   - The reports are thorough and consistent; they correctly identify the code as benign.  \n   - The only minor point is that the copyright year is set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (assuming current date is before 2025). This is unusual but not malicious—possibly a typo or a placeholder.\n\n4. **Scores assigned:**  \n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity.  \n   - Confidence is 1, which is reasonable.\n\n5. **Potential issues or assumptions:**  \n   - No assumptions about malicious intent are justified here.  \n   - The code is straightforward and typical for package versioning.\n\n6. **Overall assessment:**  \n   - The code is purely metadata with no malicious or obfuscated elements.  \n   - No vulnerabilities are present, and the risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Additional note:** The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, but this does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a standard version declaration with no security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions.",
