  "purpose": "Defines a version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable with a static string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; static assignment of a string value.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials (beyond version info), or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code includes only a simple comment, a copyright statement, and the assignment of a version string to __version__. There are no input sources, no data processing, or dynamic code execution. The version string is hardcoded, which is typical for package versioning. No indications of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and standard for defining package version information. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
