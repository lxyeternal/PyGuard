  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "None; the code is a simple static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual future copyright year (2025), but no malicious or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string, with no dynamic elements, inputs, or external data. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The only notable aspect is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder but not malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign, standard version declaration with no security issues or malicious intent. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and do not require modification.",
