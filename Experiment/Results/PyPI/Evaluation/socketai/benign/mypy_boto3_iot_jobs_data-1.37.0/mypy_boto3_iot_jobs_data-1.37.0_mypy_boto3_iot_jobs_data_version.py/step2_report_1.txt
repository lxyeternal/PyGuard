  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a straightforward, static assignment of a version string with a copyright notice.\n- There are no data flows, external inputs, dynamic code, or suspicious behaviors.\n- The code is standard for defining package version metadata.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. All reports agree on this.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:** No logical or security flaws are evident. The only minor note is the copyright year being 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date, but this is not inherently malicious or problematic.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n  - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n  - **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n- **Risk score justification:** Since there's no malicious behavior, no dynamic code, and no external data handling, the overall risk score should remain at 0.\n- **Malware score:** Confirmed as 0, since there's no indication of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Confirmed as 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None; the code is static and standard.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code snippet is a standard, benign version declaration with no security issues or malicious intent. The existing assessments and scores are correct.",
