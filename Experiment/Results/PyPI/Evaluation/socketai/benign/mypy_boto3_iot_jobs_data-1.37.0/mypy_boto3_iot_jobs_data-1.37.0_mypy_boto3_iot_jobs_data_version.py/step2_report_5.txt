  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of the issues in the code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`, with a copyright notice.\n   - There are no inputs, dynamic code, data flows, or suspicious operations.\n   - The code snippets are minimal and typical for package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' logic or reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and correctly identify that the code is benign.\n   - They note the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - All reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, which is justified.\n   - No reason exists to increase this score based on the code.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The malware score is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities; all assessments correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - The future copyright date is noted but not considered suspicious.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The only notable aspect is the future copyright year (2025). While unusual, it doesn't indicate malicious intent.\n- The code is standard for package versioning and contains no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a typical version declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
