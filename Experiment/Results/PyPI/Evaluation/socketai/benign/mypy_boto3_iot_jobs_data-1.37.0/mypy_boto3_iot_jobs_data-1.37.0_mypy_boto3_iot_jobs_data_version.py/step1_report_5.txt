  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple version assignment and copyright notice.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a copyright notice, a version string assignment, and a comment. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The version string is hardcoded but not suspicious. The copyright date is set in 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date, but this is not inherently malicious. Overall, the code is straightforward and appears to serve as a metadata declaration with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version declaration with a copyright notice, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
