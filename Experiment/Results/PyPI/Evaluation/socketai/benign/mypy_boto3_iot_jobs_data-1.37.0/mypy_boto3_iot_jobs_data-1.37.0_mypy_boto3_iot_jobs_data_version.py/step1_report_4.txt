  "purpose": "Defines the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "The string assignment '__version__ = \"1.37.0\"'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - straightforward assignment without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment and a single assignment of the version string to the variable '__version__'. There are no data inputs, no dynamic code, and no suspicious operations. It serves as a static metadata definition for the package version. There are no sources of untrusted data, no code execution, and no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard practice for Python packages and contains no suspicious or harmful code.",
