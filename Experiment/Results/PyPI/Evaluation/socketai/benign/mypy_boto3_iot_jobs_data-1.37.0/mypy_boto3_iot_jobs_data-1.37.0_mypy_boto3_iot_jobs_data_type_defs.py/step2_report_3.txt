  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the code to assess the security implications, correctness, and consistency of the scores.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Content or Exploitable Flaws:**\n   - The code consists solely of static type definitions, type aliases, and conditional imports for compatibility.\n   - No functions, runtime logic, network operations, or data processing are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n   - The use of conditional imports based on `sys.version_info` is standard for maintaining compatibility across Python versions.\n   - The copyright year (2025) is future-dated but not inherently malicious; it could be a typo or placeholder.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Report:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely for static type annotations and documentation.\n   - The only minor point is the future year (2025), which is unlikely to be a security concern but could be a typo.\n\n3. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0 or very close to 0, which aligns with the analysis. One report assigns 0.1, possibly reflecting a cautious approach due to the future date or the conditional import complexity. This is reasonable and does not indicate a significant concern.\n\n4. **Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis. Given the nature of the code, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n   - The security risk scores are very low, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1.0, reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n\n5. **Potential for Supply Chain Attack or Malicious Exploitation:**\n   - Since the code is purely type definitions with no executable or dynamic content, the risk of supply chain compromise is minimal.\n   - No external data or untrusted inputs are processed or handled insecurely.\n\n**Summary and Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, standard type annotations and conditional imports.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions for static analysis, with no security concerns.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Maintain the malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Keep the security risk score at 0 or 0.1 if a conservative approach is preferred.\n- No further action needed; the code is safe and standard for its purpose.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, and the scores appropriately reflect its benign nature.",
