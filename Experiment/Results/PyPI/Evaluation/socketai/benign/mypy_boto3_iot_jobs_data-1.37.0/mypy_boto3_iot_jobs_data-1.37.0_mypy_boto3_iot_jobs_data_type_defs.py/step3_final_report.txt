  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS IoT Jobs Data SDK, providing static type annotations for various request and response structures.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, import statements, and constant definitions; no runtime data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, untrusted input handling, or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Static type definitions without data flow or dynamic execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns; the only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025), which is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations, type aliases, and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. There are no executable functions, runtime logic, network operations, or data handling. No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code is standard for SDK type definitions, with high confidence in its benign nature. The minimal security risk score (0) and malware score (0) are appropriate. The slight increase in risk score (0.1) in some reports is justifiable due to the future copyright year but does not indicate any security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static type definitions for the AWS IoT SDK, entirely benign and free of malicious or obfuscated content. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. No modifications are necessary; the security scores should remain at zero across all categories.",
