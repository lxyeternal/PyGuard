{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the iot-jobs-data service to facilitate type safety and clarity in Python code interacting with AWS IoT Jobs Data Plane.",
  "sources": "The code reads metadata and type definitions from imports, such as sys, typing, and botocore.response. It does not process external input or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows to security-sensitive operations are present. The code primarily defines data types and does not execute or handle untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "The code sets up type annotations and data structures, with no runtime data flow or processing of untrusted data; it is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. It uses standard Python features for type definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured type definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It defines various data types related to IoT Jobs, using standard libraries and patterns. No dynamic execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is clean, clear, and appears to be part of a codebase for type hinting and data validation, not runtime logic or input processing.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code. It serves as a static type definition module for AWS IoT Jobs Data service, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
