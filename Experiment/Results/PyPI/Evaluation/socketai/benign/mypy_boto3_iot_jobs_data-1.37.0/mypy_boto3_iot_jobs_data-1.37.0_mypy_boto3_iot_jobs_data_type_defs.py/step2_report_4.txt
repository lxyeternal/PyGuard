  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clarifies that the code is for type definitions in an SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; the copyright year (2025) is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Purely static type definitions, no runtime logic, no data processing.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK type definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. \n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that this code is purely for type annotations and does not contain malicious content. The high confidence (1.0) and zero scores for malware and obfuscation are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, static type annotations, imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or untrusted input handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; copyright year 2025 is noted but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, no runtime data handling, just type definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (slightly above zero but justified as a minor security consideration).\n\n**Assessment:** The minor security risk score (0.1) is acceptable given the absence of actual vulnerabilities. The malware score remains zero, as expected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static type definitions, no data processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; code is straightforward.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic or executable code, just data structure definitions.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or security concerns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is purely for static type annotations with no suspicious content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type definitions, compatibility imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard practice.\n- **Analysis:** Static type definitions, no runtime logic.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the content; safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type annotations, no runtime code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard pattern.\n- **Analysis:** Purely declarative, no executable code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious content. The code is purely static type definitions with no runtime or dynamic code. **I agree with a malware score of 0.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation patterns, no code hiding, no dynamic code generation. **A score of 0 is appropriate.**\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—static type annotations with no runtime logic, no data processing, no external inputs—there's no security risk. The only minor note is the copyright year 2025, which is unusual but not malicious. The second report assigns a risk of 0.1, which seems reasonable as a minimal placeholder, but generally, this is negligible.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect that the code is safe, standard, and intended solely for static type hinting in an SDK.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe entire set of reports correctly assesses the code as benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk content. The scores should remain at zero across all categories, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Note:** No further action needed; the supply chain security is intact.",
