{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for the iot-jobs-data service API, intended to facilitate type checking and data validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.response, and local modules; constants and class definitions within the module.",
  "sinks": "None observed; the code only defines data types and imports modules. No untrusted data handling, network communication, or data leakage points are present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code does not process runtime data or user input; it only declares types and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or hidden mechanisms are present. The code relies on standard type annotations and conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of type definitions for AWS IoT Jobs Data Service, with conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility. It defines various TypedDict structures representing request and response formats, and a Union type for blobs. There are no functions, executable code, or dynamic behaviors that could be malicious. The imports are standard, and no external or untrusted sources are used at runtime. The only noteworthy aspect is the inclusion of sys.version_info checks for compatibility, which is standard practice and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a type definition module for AWS IoT Jobs Data Service interactions. It contains no malicious, backdoored, or suspicious code. It is safe and purely declarative, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
