{
  "purpose": "Type definitions and annotations for the iot-jobs-data service, used for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, sys, typing, and external modules (botocore.response, .literals). Definitions are mostly static TypedDicts and type aliases.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only defines data types and imports, with no data processing or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; primarily static type definitions and imports with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. The copyright year is 2025, which may be inconsistent but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and external modules, uses conditional imports based on sys.version_info, and defines various TypedDict classes and type aliases for use in type hinting. The __all__ tuple exposes the API surface. No functions, data processing, or runtime logic that could be exploited or indicate malicious intent. The code is purely for static type annotations and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate static type definition module for the AWS IoT Jobs Data service, with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It is well-structured, adheres to normal practices, and contains no suspicious activity.",
