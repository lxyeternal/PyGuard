  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code to verify claims, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely type definitions for the SDK, with no executable logic or data processing. No malicious patterns or hardcoded secrets. The confidence is high (1.0). Malware and security risk scores are zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The report accurately describes the code as static type annotations and data class definitions. No suspicious activity, code obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature of the code, standard imports, and absence of untrusted data handling. Notes the copyright year (2025) as possibly inconsistent but not malicious.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is correct. The code is purely for static type checking, with no runtime logic or security concerns. The mention of the future copyright year is not a security issue.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is for type annotations, with no runtime data flow or untrusted input processing. No anomalies or suspicious patterns. Confident that it’s a benign static type definition module.\n\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a standard set of type definitions, with no runtime logic, data handling, or suspicious behaviors. No backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is safe, well-structured, and intended solely for static type checking.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines types and constants for the AWS IoT service, with no executable code or data processing. No external or untrusted sources involved. Compatibility checks are standard.\n\n- **Assessment:** The description aligns with the actual code. No malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static type definitions, with no executable logic, data processing, or network operations.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Content:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is straightforward, using standard Python typing features, conditional imports for compatibility, and well-structured type definitions.\n\n- **Security Risks:** Given the nature of the code, the risk is minimal. It’s purely declarative, used for static analysis, and does not handle untrusted data or perform any runtime actions.\n\n- **Scores & Justification:**\n  - **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n  - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious code)\n  - **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk from static type definitions)\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in the reports seem appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n- The high confidence scores (1.0) are justified, given the straightforward, benign nature of the code.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe provided code is a standard, well-structured set of static type definitions for the AWS IoT Jobs Data SDK. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive content. The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should all remain at **0**.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
