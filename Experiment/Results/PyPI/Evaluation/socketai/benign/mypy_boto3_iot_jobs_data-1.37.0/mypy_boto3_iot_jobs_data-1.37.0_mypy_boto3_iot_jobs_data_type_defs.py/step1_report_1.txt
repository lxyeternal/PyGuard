  "purpose": "Type definitions for iot-jobs-data service, used for data validation and documentation within the SDK.",
  "sources": "Constants and type annotations; imports from standard library, botocore, and local literals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data or perform actions with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A - primarily type definitions with no executable or data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. Use of conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of type alias definitions, data class (TypedDict) structures, and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or input/output handling that could be exploited or malicious. The use of type annotations and constants aligns with normal SDK development. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of type definitions for the iot-jobs-data SDK, with no malicious or suspicious content. It appears to be standard, well-structured, and safe for use.",
