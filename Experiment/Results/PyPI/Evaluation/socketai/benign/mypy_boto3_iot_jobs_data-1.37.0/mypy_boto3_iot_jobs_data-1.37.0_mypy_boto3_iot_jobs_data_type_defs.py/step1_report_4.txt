  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for iot-jobs-data service to facilitate type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Module imports, sys.version_info checks, type definitions, and constant declarations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; primarily static type definitions.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; definitions serve as static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected. The code is well-structured with clear typing; no suspicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script provides type definitions using Python's typing and TypedDict for a specific AWS IoT Jobs Data service. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility. No functions execute runtime logic; all are static type declarations. The license and documentation comments are benign. No signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated segments, are present. The module's purpose is to enhance code clarity and type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of type definitions intended for static type checking, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
