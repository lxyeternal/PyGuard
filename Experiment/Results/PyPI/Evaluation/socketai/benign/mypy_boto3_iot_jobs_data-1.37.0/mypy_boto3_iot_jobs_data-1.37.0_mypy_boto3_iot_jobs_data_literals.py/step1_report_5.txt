  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS IoT Jobs Data service literals and related service/resource/region names.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a copyright notice dated 2025, which is future-dated; this is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides static type annotations for various AWS service names and status types, using Python's Literal types. The conditional import for compatibility is standard practice. There are no operations involving external data, network communication, or sensitive data handling. The only notable anomaly is the future year in the copyright notice, which is likely a typo or placeholder but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward, benign module defining type literals for AWS service identifiers and status types. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The future-dated copyright is unusual but harmless. Overall, this code poses no security risk.",
