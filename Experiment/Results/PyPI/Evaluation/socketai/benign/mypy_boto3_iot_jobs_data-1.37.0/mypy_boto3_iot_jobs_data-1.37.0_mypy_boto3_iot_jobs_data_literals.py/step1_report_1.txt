  "purpose": "Define type annotations and string literal types for AWS SDK service names, resource names, regions, and job statuses, primarily to enhance code clarity and type safety in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Import statement for sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; the code solely defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code does not handle or process external input or execute dynamic code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is purely declarative, defining literals and type annotations with no runtime behavior or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with a module docstring describing its purpose and usage, including a copyright statement. It conditionally imports 'Literal' depending on the Python version. It defines several type aliases as string literal types representing AWS service names, resource types, regions, and job statuses. The literals are extensive but statically defined, with no dynamic or executable logic. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, nor any code that performs external communication or data manipulation. The structure and content suggest this is a benign, well-structured module intended for type safety and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, serving as type annotations for AWS-related string literals. It contains no executable or malicious components, no dynamic data handling, and no signs of sabotage or malware. It is a safe, standard utility module for type hinting in Python projects.",
