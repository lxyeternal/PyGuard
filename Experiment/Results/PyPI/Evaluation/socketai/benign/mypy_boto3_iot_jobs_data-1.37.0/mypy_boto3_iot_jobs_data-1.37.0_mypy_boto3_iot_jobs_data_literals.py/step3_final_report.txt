  "purpose": "Define type annotations and string literal types for AWS SDK service names, resource names, regions, and job statuses.",
  "sources": "Static string literals and type alias definitions; no external input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; static definitions only.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year 2025, likely a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations for AWS identifiers, with no runtime logic, external data handling, or obfuscation. The only unusual aspect is the future year in the copyright statement, which does not pose a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and safe for use. It serves as a utility module for type safety without any malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which can be corrected but does not impact security.",
