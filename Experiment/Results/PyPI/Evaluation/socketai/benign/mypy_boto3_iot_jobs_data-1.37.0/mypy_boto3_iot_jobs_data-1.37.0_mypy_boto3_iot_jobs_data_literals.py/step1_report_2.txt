  "purpose": "Type annotations for AWS IoT Jobs Data service literal definitions and other AWS service identifiers, used for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Import of sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions; assignment of multiple Literal types for service names, region names, and status types.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks indicating untrusted data processing or data leaks; the code primarily defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no input handling or external data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual copyright year (2025) which is in the future, but likely a typographical error or placeholder; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior; extensive list of service names and regions appears to be static data.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward collection of type aliases using Literal for AWS service names, region names, and status types. It includes a conditional import for compatibility with different Python versions. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, command execution, or obfuscated logic. The only potential concern is the copyright year which is in the future, but this does not pose a security threat. Overall, the code is purely declarative, serving as type hints for static analysis, with no runtime behavior or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a static set of type aliases for AWS-related constants, with no apparent security issues. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder.",
