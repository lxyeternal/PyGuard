  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for AWS SDK service names, statuses, regions, etc. No external input handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely declarative, with no runtime behavior or external data processing. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct; no obfuscation detected.  \n  - Risk: 0 — Correct; no security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment. The code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining AWS service literals, with a note on the future copyright year (2025).\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The future year is unusual but likely a placeholder or typo. No malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is static and safe.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is appropriate. The future date does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static definitions for AWS identifiers.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No external data handling or malicious activity. The code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines AWS literals with conditional import for compatibility.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or obfuscated code. The content is static, with no dynamic or external interactions.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type definitions, with mention of the future year (2025).\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; the future date is likely a placeholder. No external data or dynamic code.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — Correct.  \n  - Risk: 0 — Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All zero, consistent with the static, declarative nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** All zero, as the code is purely for type annotations and contains no executable or external data handling.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the entire set of reports and the code itself, I concur with the assigned scores. The code is benign, static, and intended solely for type safety in Python projects. The only anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is likely a placeholder or typo, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the code's nature.",
