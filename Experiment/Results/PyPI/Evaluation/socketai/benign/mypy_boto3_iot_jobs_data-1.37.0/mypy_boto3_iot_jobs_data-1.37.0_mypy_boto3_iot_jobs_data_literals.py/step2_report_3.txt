  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the reasoning, and the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a set of static type aliases and constants defining AWS service names, regions, statuses, etc.\n- The code is purely declarative, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n- The only noted anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future, but this is likely a typo or placeholder.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, secrets, or external data handling are observed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define type annotations for AWS SDK service names, statuses, regions, etc.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign, static, and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Security Risk 0, Confidence 1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on IoT Jobs Data service.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The mention of the future copyright year (2025) is noted, but it's not a security concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Security Risk 0, Confidence 0.95 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment. The future year is a minor anomaly but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define string literal types for AWS services and regions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward, with no external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Security Risk 0, Confidence 1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, defining AWS SDK literals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious elements; the code is purely static.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Security Risk 0, Confidence 1 — suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define AWS IoT Jobs Data service literals.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The future year in the copyright is the only anomaly.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Security Risk 0, Confidence 1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** All are 0, given the static nature and lack of external data handling.\n\n**Potential Adjustments:**\n\n- The only point of minor concern is the future copyright year (2025). While not malicious, it might be worth noting as an anomaly. However, it doesn't impact security or malware assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimation:**\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent and declarative.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessment. The code is a benign, static set of type annotations for AWS SDK usage, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only anomaly (future copyright year) is a typo or placeholder, not a security concern.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores; no changes needed.",
