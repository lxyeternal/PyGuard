  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS SDK service names, resource types, region names, and job status types for type annotations and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'sys' and 'typing' modules, conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version, and assignments of string literals to type aliases.",
  "sinks": "None of the code interacts with untrusted input or performs data output; it solely defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code does not process external input or produce output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. The code primarily consists of type definitions and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for AWS service names, resource types, regions, and job statuses, with conditional import for compatibility across Python versions. No code execution, input handling, or network operations are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious logic. All elements serve to enhance type safety and documentation clarity in AWS SDK usage.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, purely declarative, and serves as type annotations for AWS SDK parameters. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
