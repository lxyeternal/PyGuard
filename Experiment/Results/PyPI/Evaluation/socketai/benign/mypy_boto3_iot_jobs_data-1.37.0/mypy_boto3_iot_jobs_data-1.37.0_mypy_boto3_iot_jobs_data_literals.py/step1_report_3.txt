  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS service names, job statuses, regions, and resource types for type annotations.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions and import statements; no external input or data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted destinations or effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of type alias definitions and conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS service identifiers, job statuses, and regions using Python Literal types. It includes a conditional import to support Python versions below 3.12. No user input, network activity, or data processing occurs. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs are present. The code's structure is straightforward and adheres to normal type annotation practices. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module intended for type hinting and documentation support. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The content is purely static and for type safety, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
