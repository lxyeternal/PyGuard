  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for AWS IoT Jobs Data Plane client SDK interface.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as kwargs, Params, HttpMethod, and internal class attributes.",
  "sinks": "API request parameters, including untrusted input in method calls like generate_presigned_url.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input flows from method parameters into API request setup, with no internal processing or external system modification.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected. Use of 'Unpack' for type hints is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface with type annotations, class definitions, and exception handling. It accepts untrusted input parameters typical for SDKs but does not process or execute them maliciously. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The potential for misuse exists in how the SDK is used externally but is not indicative of malicious intent within the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK interface for AWS IoT Jobs Data Plane, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
