  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python module, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading local README.md file for long description; static import of Path and setuptools.setup.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md as static input; no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and conventional for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script that imports standard modules, reads a local README.md file, and defines package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscated logic. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned by reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's static and standard nature. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or anomalies are present. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is benign, standard, and poses no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scoring is appropriate.",
