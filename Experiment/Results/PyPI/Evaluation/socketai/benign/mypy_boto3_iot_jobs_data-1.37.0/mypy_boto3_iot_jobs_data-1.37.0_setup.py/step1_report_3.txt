  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-iot-jobs-data' to facilitate installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; reading package metadata and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or processes untrusted input data or exposes sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No external untrusted data flows from source to sink; mainly static configuration data is used.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and the 'setuptools' library, reads a local README file for long description, and calls 'setup()' with static package metadata. All data appears to be static, well-formed, and typical of a standard Python setup script. There are no dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or suspicious network calls. The install_requires entry correctly specifies a version condition for 'typing-extensions'. No anomalies or signs of malicious activity are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and installation instructions.",
