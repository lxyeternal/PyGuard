{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for packaging the mypy-boto3-iot-jobs-data Python library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description, and uses static data for package setup. No external input is processed.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects. No network, file write, or environment modification code detected.",
  "flows": "N/A – the script is static and does not process untrusted input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, hardcoded secrets (beyond standard package metadata), or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, importing standard modules, defining package metadata, and invoking setuptools.setup(). It reads a markdown file for description and specifies dependencies with environment markers. There are no functions, dynamic code execution, or data handling that could indicate malicious activity. No code injection, network activity, or credential management is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign, standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
