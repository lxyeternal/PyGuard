  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package 'mypy-boto3-iot-jobs-data' with metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, and static package metadata declarations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no external data sinks or network calls.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration data is assigned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and configuration. It reads a local file for description, sets package info, and specifies dependencies with version constraints. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used. No suspicious code or malicious behavior is evident. The code follows common conventions for packaging Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate, standard setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks.",
