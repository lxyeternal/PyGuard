  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is minimal, primarily importing a client class and exposing it.\n- No user input, external data processing, or network operations are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n- The only unusual element is the copyright date set to 2025, which is in the future, possibly indicating outdated info or placeholders.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- **Presence of a future copyright date (2025):**  \n  *This is unusual but not malicious.* It could be a typo or placeholder, but it does not affect security.\n\n- **Code structure:**  \n  The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution or data flow from untrusted sources.\n\n**No actual vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present.**\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Main interface, documentation, client setup.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; no malicious logic, just static documentation and import.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low, as it's a basic setup).\n\n**Score adjustments:**  \n- The securityRisk of 0.1 seems reasonable given the benign nature.  \n- Malware score is 0, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Interface setup, documentation.\n- **Analysis:** Correct; boilerplate code, no external data or dynamic code.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 3\n- Same as above, straightforward wrapper, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 4\n- Similar to previous; no external data, no dynamic execution.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### Report 5\n- Same analysis, benign interface code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n**The only minor point is the future copyright date (2025), which is an anomaly but not malicious.**\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust the overall scores:**  \n  Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, I would set the **malware score to 0**, **obfuscated to 0**, and **risk to 0**.\n\n- **Justify higher scores:**  \n  None are justified; the code is standard, boilerplate, with no security issues.\n\n- **Address anomalies:**  \n  The future date should be corrected or clarified, but it does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value | Justification                                               |\n|------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                   | No malicious code or behavior present.                       |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                   | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.            |\n| Security Risk    | 0                   | No vulnerabilities, data leaks, or suspicious logic.       |\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are accurate in their assessments; I concur with their conclusions that the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
