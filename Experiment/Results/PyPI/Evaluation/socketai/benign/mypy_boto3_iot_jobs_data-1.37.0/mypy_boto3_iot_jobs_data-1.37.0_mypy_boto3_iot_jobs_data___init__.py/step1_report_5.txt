{
  "purpose": "Provides the main interface for the iot-jobs-data service, allowing users to instantiate and access the IoT Jobs Data Plane client.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module .client; no external data inputs or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly imports and assigns class references.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a copyright date in the future (2025), which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a client class from a local module, assigns it to a variable, and defines an export list. The included documentation and usage example are standard. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations are present. The presence of a future copyright date is an anomaly but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple interface wrapper for a service client with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a standard, benign module setup.",
