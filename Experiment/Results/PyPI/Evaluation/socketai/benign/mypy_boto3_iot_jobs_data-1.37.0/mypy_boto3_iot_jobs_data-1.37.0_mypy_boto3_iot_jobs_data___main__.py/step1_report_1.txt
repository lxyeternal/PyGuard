  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides informational output about boto3 IoTJobsDataPlane, including version and documentation links.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (outputs info)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs data), potentially influenced by external command-line args (though safe in this context)",
  "flows": "Command-line argument --version (source) triggers print_version (sink), otherwise print_info (sink) is called",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, malicious code, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious external calls.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs package information or version based on command-line input. It does not process or handle any untrusted data beyond printing static strings. No suspicious or malicious activity, external network access, or data exfiltration observed. The structure is simple, with clear separation of functions and minimal logic. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious, and it is limited to informational output.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package info and version. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected.",
