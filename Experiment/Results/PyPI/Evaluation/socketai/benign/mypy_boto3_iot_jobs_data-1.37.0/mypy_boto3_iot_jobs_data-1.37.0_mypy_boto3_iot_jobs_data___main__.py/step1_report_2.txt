  "purpose": "CLI utility to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs information to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv influences execution flow, leading to either printing version or package info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code structures; straightforward info printing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI entry point that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line input. It does not process untrusted data beyond reading command-line args and writes static text to stdout. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, no use of environment variables, and no malicious logic are present. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI script that solely outputs static package info and version data. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies detected.",
