  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No external network requests or system modifications present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI script that outputs static information based on command-line input. It reads command-line arguments and outputs package info or version to standard output. No untrusted data sources, no data flows to external systems, and no obfuscated or malicious code observed. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The license comment indicates a future date (2025), which is not inherently suspicious but suggests future-proofing or placeholder content.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears benign, serving as a simple informational CLI utility without any malicious intent or security risks.",
