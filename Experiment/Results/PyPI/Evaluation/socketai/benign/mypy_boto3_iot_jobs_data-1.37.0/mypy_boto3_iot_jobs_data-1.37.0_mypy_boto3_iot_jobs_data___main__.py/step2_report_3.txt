  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code to ensure consistency, correctness, and thoroughness.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Simple CLI utility.\n- Prints static package info or version based on command-line argument.\n- No external network activity, no dynamic code execution, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Functions are straightforward, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Confirmed Issues in the Code\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code.\n- **Malware:** Score of 0 across all reports is accurate.\n- **Obfuscation:** Score of 0, as code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Score of 0, as no security concerns are evident.\n\n### 2. Logical and Reasoning Flaws in the Reports\n- The reports are consistent in their analysis: all recognize the code as benign, straightforward, and non-malicious.\n- They correctly identify the flow: command-line argument influences output.\n- No flawed reasoning or overestimations are apparent.\n- The detailed analysis aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n### 3. Score Justifications\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- Since the code does not perform any malicious actions, the risk score remains at 0.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is detected or implied.\n- Obfuscation score remains at 0, given the code clarity.\n\n### 4. Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations\n- No report assigns a risk score higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The detailed justifications for the scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### 5. Challenging Assumptions\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on static analysis.\n- The only notable point is the future date (2025) in the license comment, which is benign and possibly a placeholder.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment & Recommendations**\n\n**Overall Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a minimal CLI utility with static output.  \n- No malicious or suspicious activity is present or implied.  \n- No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are detected.  \n- The code is safe for use and does not pose security risks.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nWhile the code is safe, always consider context—if future modifications introduce dynamic behaviors or external dependencies, re-evaluation would be necessary. For now, the assessment stands correct.",
