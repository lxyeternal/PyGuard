  "purpose": "CLI entry point that outputs package information and version details",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout for writing output to console",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version() which flows to sys.stdout.write, otherwise print_info() flows to sys.stdout.write",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious patterns. No external network connections or data exfiltration observed. No obfuscated or unusual code constructs. The license comment appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple CLI functions to print package info and version. It checks for '--version' argument to determine output. Uses standard library sys for input/output. No user input parsing, no external data fetching, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of malicious activity or backdoors. The code is straightforward and serves a documentation or informational purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility intended for informational output about the package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
