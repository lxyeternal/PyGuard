  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or handling of untrusted data.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The functions are straightforward, and the control flow is simple and predictable.\n   - The license comment mentions the year 2025, which is a future date, but this alone isn't suspicious.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious, such as executing external code, modifying system state, or exfiltrating data.\n   - The code is purely informational and safe.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the script.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which aligns with the code's behavior.\n   - The confidence levels are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - The purpose and analysis sections support the conclusion that this is a safe, informational CLI utility.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all claims are based on static code analysis.\n   - The code does not interact with external systems or handle untrusted input beyond command-line args, which are generally considered safe in this context.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is straightforward, with no malicious intent.\n   - The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - The malware score should remain 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score should remain 0, as the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n   - The security risk score should remain 0, given the lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores are appropriate based on the static analysis and the reports' findings.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info and version. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If future versions of this script incorporate dynamic features, external calls, or handle untrusted input differently, re-evaluation would be necessary.",
