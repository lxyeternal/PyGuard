  "purpose": "A minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), which outputs version; otherwise, print_info() outputs package info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. License comment with future date (2025) is unusual but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static CLI script that outputs package info or version based on argument. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted input beyond command-line args. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The control flow is predictable, and the functions are straightforward. The license comment's future date is likely a placeholder. All signals indicate benign, static behavior with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
