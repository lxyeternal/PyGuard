  "purpose": "Retrieve and store the version information of the 'mido' package if installed.",
  "sources": "importlib_metadata.version(\"mido\") which reads the installed package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as the code only reads package metadata and assigns a version string.",
  "flows": "importlib_metadata.version(\"mido\") -> assigns to __version__",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code. The version string is fetched dynamically.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine the version of the 'mido' package using importlib.metadata (Python 3.8+) or fallback to importlib_metadata for earlier versions. It initializes __version__ with a default value and updates it if the package is found. No untrusted data sources are involved, and there are no suspicious code behaviors such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The purpose appears to be standard package version retrieval with compatible fallbacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward and safe implementation for retrieving package version information with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
