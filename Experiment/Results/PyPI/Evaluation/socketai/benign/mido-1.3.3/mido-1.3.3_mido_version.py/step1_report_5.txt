{
  "purpose": "To determine the version of the 'mido' package, or fallback if not installed, primarily for compatibility or informational purposes.",
  "sources": "importlib_metadata.version('mido')",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no data leaks, network connections, or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. The import of metadata and version handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version handling utilities and attempts to retrieve the installed version of the 'mido' package. It includes compatibility for different Python versions. There are no inputs from external untrusted sources, no network operations, or suspicious code. The use of importlib_metadata to fetch package version is common and benign. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version retrieval snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It safely handles missing packages and ensures compatibility across Python versions.",
