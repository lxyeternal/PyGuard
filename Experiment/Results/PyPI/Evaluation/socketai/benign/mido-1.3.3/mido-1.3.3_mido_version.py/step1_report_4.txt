{
  "purpose": "To determine the version of the 'mido' package installed in the environment, supporting both Python 3.8+ and earlier versions.",
  "sources": "The importlib_metadata.version() function call to retrieve package version information.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the code simply retrieves package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a fallback import for compatibility with older Python versions, which is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by defining copyright and license metadata. It then imports a version parsing library and conditionally imports the appropriate module for retrieving package metadata based on Python version. It initializes a default version string, then attempts to retrieve the installed 'mido' package version using importlib_metadata. If the package is not found, it silently continues. The code's primary function is to fetch package version info in a compatible way, with no malicious or suspicious operations observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign utility for obtaining package version information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
