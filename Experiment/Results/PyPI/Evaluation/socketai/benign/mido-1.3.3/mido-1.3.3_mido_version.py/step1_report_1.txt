{
  "purpose": "The code aims to retrieve and store the version information of the 'mido' Python package, with compatibility handling for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package name 'mido' for version retrieval via importlib_metadata.version() and the __version__ variable assigned statically.",
  "sinks": "The version information is stored in variables but is not used further for any potentially unsafe operations or output.",
  "flows": "The code sources package version data from importlib_metadata.version() based on the package name 'mido'. The data flow is from this source to the __version__ variable.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or unusual code constructs. The version retrieval logic is standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with licensing metadata and imports necessary modules. It handles compatibility for Python versions before and after 3.8 by importing importlib.metadata accordingly. It initializes __version__ with a default development string. Then, it attempts to retrieve the installed version of the 'mido' package using importlib_metadata.version(). If the package isn't installed, it quietly ignores the error. The version string is then parsed into a packaging.version.Version object. No user input, external data, or network activity beyond the standard library calls occurs. The code does not execute any untrusted data or perform dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code's purpose is to safely determine the installed version of a specific package, with compatibility considerations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The code is standard and well-contained.",
