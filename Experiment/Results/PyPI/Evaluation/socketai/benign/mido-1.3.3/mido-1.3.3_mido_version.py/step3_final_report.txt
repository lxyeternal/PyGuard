  "purpose": "Retrieve the installed version of the 'mido' package with compatibility handling for Python versions before and after 3.8.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata to fetch package version info",
  "sinks": "Assignment to __version__, potential for exception handling if package not found",
  "flows": "importlib_metadata.version('mido') -> __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version retrieval, no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard utility for fetching the version of a package, with proper fallback for different Python versions. It handles missing packages gracefully and does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The logic is clear, and the error handling is appropriate. The code's benign nature is consistent with the absence of malicious or security-compromising behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for retrieving package version information. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, security risk score of 0.1, and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate and justified.",
