{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse MIDI byte streams into messages, functioning as a MIDI message decoder.",
  "sources": "Input data via the constructor (data parameter), feed() method, and feed_byte() method; input bytes are also directly received through the feed_byte() method.",
  "sinks": "The parsed messages stored in self._messages deque, which can be iterated over, but there are no external sinks or output mechanisms that transmit or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from feed() or feed_byte() methods into internal processing (_feed_data_byte and _feed_status_byte), resulting in stored messages in self._messages; no external data leaks or transmissions occur.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard for a MIDI parser; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes with optional data, processes MIDI bytes based on status or data byte rules, and accumulates complete messages. It correctly handles various MIDI message types, including SysEx messages. Input validation ensures only integer bytes within 0-255 are accepted. No external network communication, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. The structure and logic are typical for MIDI parsing. No anomalies or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard MIDI byte stream parser with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It functions solely as a decoder for MIDI data streams without any external communication or malicious payloads.",
