{
  "purpose": "The code implements a MIDI byte stream parser that splits incoming MIDI data into messages.",
  "sources": "Input data via the 'feed' method, which processes an iterable of bytes; individual bytes through 'feed_byte'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted data directly; messages are stored in internal queues and processed internally.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed byte-by-byte, with status bytes triggering different handling paths; messages are accumulated and stored in internal queues.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code appears to be a standard MIDI message parser with no unusual behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward MIDI byte stream parser, handling standard MIDI message types and statuses. It performs input validation on bytes, correctly distinguishes between status and data bytes, and maintains internal state for message parsing. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system modifications. The logic aligns with standard MIDI processing, and there are no anomalies or suspicious constructs. The only external references are to imported specifications, which are presumed safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured MIDI parser with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs input validation and maintains proper internal state. There are no signs of malicious code, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities.",
