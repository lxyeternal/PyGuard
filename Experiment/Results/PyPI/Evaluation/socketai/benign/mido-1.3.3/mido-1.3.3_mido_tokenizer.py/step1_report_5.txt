{
  "purpose": "The code implements a MIDI byte stream parser that converts raw MIDI data into structured messages.",
  "sources": "Input MIDI byte stream fed via the 'feed' or 'feed_byte' methods; data parameter in constructor.",
  "sinks": "Parsed MIDI message queue (_messages), which outputs structured messages during iteration.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into 'feed' or 'feed_byte' methods, which update internal state and message queue; messages are yielded via __iter__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated logic detected. No external network calls, file operations, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and typical for MIDI parsing.",
  "analysis": "The class 'Tokenizer' parses MIDI data streams into messages, handling status and data bytes appropriately. It maintains internal state (_status, _bytes, _messages). The code raises exceptions on invalid input types or values, which is standard for input validation. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. No external communications, cryptic code, or suspicious modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate MIDI message parser with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any suspicious operations such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. Overall, it is a safe, well-structured parser for MIDI data streams.",
