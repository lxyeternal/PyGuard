{
  "purpose": "A MIDI byte stream parser that converts raw MIDI bytes into structured messages, handling status and data bytes with proper validation.",
  "sources": "Input data fed via feed() or feed_byte(), reading bytes from an iterable or individual integers.",
  "sinks": "Stores parsed MIDI messages internally in a deque; no external data transmission or leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Bytes are classified as status or data; status bytes trigger state changes and message assembly; data bytes append to current message; complete messages are stored in the internal queue.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Input validation is standard. No external network or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward MIDI parser that validates input types and values, manages internal state for message assembly, and handles special MIDI messages like SysEx. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No malicious constructs or obfuscation are present. The code's logic aligns with standard MIDI protocol handling, and the absence of external communication or suspicious code indicates benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-implemented MIDI parser with no malicious or suspicious features. It processes untrusted input with minimal security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
