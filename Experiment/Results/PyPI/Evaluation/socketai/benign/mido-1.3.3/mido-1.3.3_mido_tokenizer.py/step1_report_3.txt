{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to parse and process MIDI byte streams into messages.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the feed() method, which takes an iterable of MIDI bytes, and feed_byte() method which processes individual bytes. The data source is external input in the form of MIDI byte streams.",
  "sinks": "Parsed MIDI messages are stored in a deque (_messages). The code does not directly send data to external systems, but the messages could be used downstream for further processing or transmission.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into feed() or feed_byte(), which process bytes and construct MIDI messages stored in _messages. These messages are then yielded via the iterator method __iter__().",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for MIDI stream parsing, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs. It does not perform network operations, file modifications, or system commands. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a MIDI byte stream parser class, handling standard MIDI message types with appropriate checks for message length, status, and data bytes. It correctly distinguishes between status and data bytes, resets parser state on invalid or special messages, and uses standard Python data structures. No suspicious data handling, external calls, or malicious behavior are present. The logic aligns with typical MIDI parsing routines and does not introduce any security concerns. The code does not execute untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a MIDI stream parser with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes input data and outputs MIDI messages as expected without any suspicious side effects.",
