{
  "purpose": "The code provides functionality to create immutable ('frozen') versions of message objects and to revert them back to mutable ('thawed') versions, primarily for use in MIDI message handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads class types, method calls, and object attributes, especially in freeze_message() and thaw_message() functions, which process message objects.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input directly; it primarily manipulates message objects. No external data sources or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input message objects are checked and either frozen or thawed, with class types determining behavior. The flow involves type checks and object attribute copying.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code implements standard object immutability techniques. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for immutable message representations and functions to convert between mutable and immutable forms. It performs type checking, object attribute copying, and class instantiation. No external input processing, network operations, or security-sensitive data handling are present. No signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or backdoors are identified. The implementation appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of immutable and mutable message wrappers with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a benign purpose within MIDI message handling. No security concerns are detected based on the provided code.",
