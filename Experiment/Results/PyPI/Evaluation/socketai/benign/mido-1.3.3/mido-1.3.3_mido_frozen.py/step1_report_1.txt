{
  "purpose": "The code provides mechanisms to create immutable ('frozen') versions of message objects and to convert between frozen and mutable states for message objects used in a MIDI processing context.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.messages, .midifiles), class instantiations, and attribute access within functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe if untrusted input can influence message types or attributes, but no explicit sinks like network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input message objects are checked and converted into frozen or thawed versions, with flow control based on instance types.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; functions are straightforward. The only notable aspect is the use of class creation via __new__ and dynamic attribute updates, which is standard but should be checked for misuse if inputs are untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for making message objects immutable ('Frozen' variants) and provides functions to convert ('freeze_message' and 'thaw_message') between frozen and mutable states. It relies on class inheritance and dynamic instance creation. The functions include type checks and handle None inputs gracefully. There is no evidence of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious network activity. The code is structurally sound and purpose-specific, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of object immutability management for message objects, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose in managing message states within a MIDI processing system.",
