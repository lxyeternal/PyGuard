{
  "purpose": "This code provides functionality for freezing and thawing MIDI message objects, making them immutable and hashable for use as dictionary keys or other collections.",
  "sources": "The code reads message objects passed to the functions freeze_message() and thaw_message(). It also accesses class variables and object attributes via vars().",
  "sinks": "The code updates internal state via vars() but does not perform any untrusted input processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "Input message objects are passed to freeze_message() or thaw_message(); their attributes are accessed and duplicated via vars() to create immutable or mutable copies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration, are present. Use of vars() is standard for object attribute copying.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements object immutability through class inheritance and attribute management, with functions for converting between mutable and immutable states. No external data sources or untrusted input handling are involved. The class design and attribute updates are straightforward. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious backdoors, or covert channels. The code's purpose is strictly to manage message object states.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for managing message object mutability with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for such functionality.",
