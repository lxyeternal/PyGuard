{
  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions to create immutable ('frozen') and mutable ('thawed') message objects, primarily for MIDI message handling, ensuring message state integrity.",
  "sources": "Reads class types (Message, MetaMessage, UnknownMetaMessage) and their attributes via vars(). No external data or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external system interactions, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input message objects are checked for their type, then their attributes are copied into new frozen or thawed instances via vars() and __new__(). No external data flows or effects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; use of __new__ and vars() is standard for such utility classes. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines immutable ('Frozen') classes inheriting from base message classes, with functions to freeze and thaw message objects by copying attributes. It employs standard Python techniques—class inheritance, __new__, vars()—to manage object states. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious code is present. The dynamic class creation is controlled and confined within known classes, posing no security risk. The code's purpose is to ensure message immutability, which it accomplishes safely and transparently.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-specific utility for managing message object states within a MIDI processing context. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
