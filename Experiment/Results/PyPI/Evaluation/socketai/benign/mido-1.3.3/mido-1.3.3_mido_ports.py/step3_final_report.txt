{
  "purpose": "This code provides MIDI port management utilities, including message handling, port control, threading safety, and multiplexing features.",
  "sources": "Internal message creation, port configuration, and message passing functions.",
  "sinks": "Sending MIDI control messages, managing port states, and handling message queues.",
  "flows": "Messages are generated and sent via port methods; threading locks ensure safe concurrent access; multiplexing functions distribute messages across multiple ports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of 'random.shuffle' is standard for fairness, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward MIDI port utility library with functions for message control, threading safety, and port multiplexing. No external data sources or network activity are present. The functions perform standard MIDI message handling and port management without any suspicious patterns or malicious behavior. The threading locks are used appropriately, and no obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard MIDI port management utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified based on the code's content.",
