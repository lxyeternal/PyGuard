{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions and classes for working with MIDI ports, including message handling, port management, and threading support.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include _receive() methods, external messages, and port data streams.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could potentially flow through _send() methods or received messages, affecting system or network behavior.",
  "flows": "Data flows from _receive() methods (sources) to send() or _send() methods (sinks), with flow control via multi_receive, iter_pending, and message queues.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Usage of threading.Lock is standard. No suspicious dynamic code or environment variable misuse observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides abstractions for MIDI port management, message polling, and threading locks, with functions for resetting or muting all channels. No external network connections or suspicious behaviors are present. The presence of threading locks and message handling appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns detected. The code relies on imported modules (.messages, .parser), but their content is not shown here; however, no malicious use is evident from the visible code.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a standard utility library for MIDI port handling with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It contains typical concurrency control and message flow mechanisms, with no suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or malware indicators.",
