{
  "purpose": "Provides a framework for managing MIDI port input/output operations, message handling, and port control functions.",
  "sources": "Reads port configuration and name parameters, message creation via Message class, and potential external callback assignments.",
  "sinks": "Sends messages via _send methods, interacts with Message objects, and potentially outputs data through ports.",
  "flows": "Input port receives data from _receive, output port sends data via _send, multi_receive polls multiple ports in a loop, and multi_send dispatches messages to multiple ports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of random.shuffle in multi_receive may affect fairness but isn't malicious. No external network connections, data leaks, or file operations are present. The code appears to be well-structured for MIDI port management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines base classes for MIDI port management, including input, output, and combined ports, with thread safety and message handling. Functions for resetting and muting all channels are standard MIDI control messages. No evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The use of threading locks, callback checks, and error handling appears appropriate. Overall, the code is a utility library for MIDI port interactions, with no malicious intent or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard MIDI port management utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles message passing, port state management, and control functions securely and appropriately. No malicious signals or anomalies are detected.",
