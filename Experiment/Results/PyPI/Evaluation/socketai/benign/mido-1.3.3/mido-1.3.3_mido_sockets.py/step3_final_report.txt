{
  "purpose": "Implement TCP/IP MIDI data transfer via socket server/client architecture, facilitating MIDI message exchange over network connections.",
  "sources": "Socket connection establishment, address parsing, data reading from socket streams, and message parsing via Parser.",
  "sinks": "Data received from network streams, potential untrusted input processed by Parser, and socket connection management.",
  "flows": "Address parsing functions feed into socket connection setup; socket streams feed into parser; data read from socket flows into message processing; socket close operations terminate connections.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Address parsing correctly validates input. No suspicious external calls or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes socket server and client connections, manages multiple ports, and processes MIDI data through a parser. It includes input validation for addresses, handles disconnections gracefully, and manages socket resources properly. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors are present. The code adheres to standard socket programming practices without obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The malware score is justified as 0, and the security risk score is low (0.2), reflecting minimal security concerns given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of MIDI over TCP/IP communication. It performs necessary socket management and data parsing without any malicious or suspicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the code's behavior.",
