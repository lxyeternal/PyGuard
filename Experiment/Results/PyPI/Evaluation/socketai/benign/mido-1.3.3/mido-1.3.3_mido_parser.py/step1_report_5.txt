{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to parse MIDI byte streams and produce MIDI messages.",
  "sources": "Input data fed via the feed() and feed_byte() methods, or during initialization (__init__).",
  "sinks": "The parsed MIDI messages stored in self.messages (a deque), and the Message.from_bytes() method processing MIDI byte sequences.",
  "flows": "Data is fed into the Tokenizer, which generates MIDI byte sequences. These sequences are decoded into Message objects via Message.from_bytes() and stored in self.messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, or unusual system interactions. The code appears straightforward with no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a MIDI parser class that processes MIDI byte streams into message objects. It utilizes a tokenizer and message classes imported from other modules. The functions accept and process input data without any insecure handling. The parsing flow involves feeding data into the tokenizer, decoding MIDI messages, and storing them for retrieval. No suspicious code patterns, no external data leaks, no network communication, nor any code that could facilitate malicious behavior are present. The code functions purely as a parser with no hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard MIDI parsing implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates solely on input data, converting MIDI bytes into message objects, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
