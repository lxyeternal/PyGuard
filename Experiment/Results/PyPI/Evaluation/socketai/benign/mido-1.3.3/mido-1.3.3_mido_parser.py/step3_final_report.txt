  "purpose": "A MIDI byte stream parser converting raw MIDI bytes into message objects for internal processing.",
  "sources": "Input data fed via 'feed', 'feed_byte', or during initialization, from external byte sequences or byte arrays.",
  "sinks": "Internal message queue 'messages' where parsed Message objects are stored; no external data sinks or leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sequences into the Tokenizer, then into Message objects via 'from_bytes', and stored in 'messages'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward MIDI parser that processes byte streams into Message objects using an external Tokenizer and Message class. It does not perform network operations, file I/O, or external data leaks. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The code's logic is clear, purpose-specific, and free of suspicious patterns. External dependencies are assumed safe; the code itself shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, purpose-built MIDI parser with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is minimal, estimated at 0.",
