  "purpose": "MIDI byte stream parser that converts MIDI data into message objects.",
  "sources": "Input data fed into the parser via the feed, feed_byte, parse, or parse_all functions.",
  "targets": "Appends parsed Message objects to the messages deque, returns message objects, or counts pending messages.",
  "flows": "Input data is fed into the Tokenizer, which produces MIDI bytes; these bytes are converted into Message objects; messages are stored in a deque; get_message retrieves and removes messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. Uses standard Python constructs. No malicious code or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a MIDI parser class that processes MIDI data streams, converting them into message objects via a Tokenizer and Message classes (assumed imported). It allows feeding data in multiple formats, processing one byte at a time or larger chunks. No external network calls, file operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code relies on imported modules for core functionality, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious payloads. The functions and methods perform standard parsing and data handling without side effects. The overall structure is typical of a data parser with no anomalies or malicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward MIDI parser with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. It performs its intended function securely. No suspicious or malicious elements detected.",
