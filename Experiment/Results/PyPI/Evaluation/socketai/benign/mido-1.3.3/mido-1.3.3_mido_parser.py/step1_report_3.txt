  "purpose": "MIDI byte stream parser that converts raw MIDI bytes into message objects for further processing.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to the Parser class via the __init__, feed, or feed_byte methods.",
  "sinks": "Message.from_bytes() method which converts MIDI bytes into message objects and appends to messages deque.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input methods (feed, feed_byte) into Tokenizer, then into Message.from_bytes, finally stored in messages queue.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; no network activity, system commands, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard MIDI parsing class with methods to feed data, retrieve messages, and parse all data. It relies on external modules Message and Tokenizer, which are not included. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears straightforward and purpose-specific without obfuscated or misleading constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a MIDI byte parser with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard Python data structures and design patterns appropriate for its purpose. No malicious or sabotage elements are detected.",
