{
  "purpose": "The code implements a MIDI byte stream parser that converts raw MIDI byte data into message objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads data through the constructor parameter 'data', the 'feed' method, and the 'feed_byte' method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that send data to external systems, network, or file systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input methods ('__init__', 'feed', 'feed_byte') to the tokenizer ('Tokenizer') and then to message creation ('Message.from_bytes'). The flow is internal and does not leak data externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variables observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a MIDI parser class that processes byte sequences into message objects, relying on external modules 'messages' and 'tokenizer'. It provides methods for feeding data, retrieving messages, and processing complete data streams. No external data is sent or stored outside the scope of parsing. No network, file operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard implementation of a MIDI parser with clear separation of concerns and no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward MIDI parser module with no malicious behavior or security risks. It reads and processes MIDI data internally without external data exfiltration or control flows. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious anomalies detected.",
