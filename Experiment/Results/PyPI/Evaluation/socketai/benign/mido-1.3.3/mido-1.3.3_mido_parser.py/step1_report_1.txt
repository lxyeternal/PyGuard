  "purpose": "MIDI byte stream parser that converts raw MIDI bytes into message objects.",
  "sources": "Input data fed into the 'feed' or 'feed_byte' methods of the Parser class.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is written or transmitted outside the code.",
  "flows": "Input data -> Tokenizer processes data -> Messages created via Message.from_bytes -> Stored in self.messages queue.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard libraries and straightforward data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a MIDI parser that consumes MIDI byte data, tokenizes it, and produces message objects. The methods provided allow feeding data in various formats and retrieving parsed messages. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation. The only external dependencies are the 'messages' and 'tokenizer' modules, which are typical for such a parser. The code appears to be a standard implementation for MIDI message parsing without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward MIDI parser module with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply processes MIDI byte streams into message objects. No suspicious code or malicious logic detected.",
