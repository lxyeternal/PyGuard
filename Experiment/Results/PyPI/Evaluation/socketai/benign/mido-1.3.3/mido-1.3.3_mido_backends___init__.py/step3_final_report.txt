  "purpose": "The code contains only license comments with SPDX identifiers and copyright notices, serving as metadata for licensing purposes.",
  "sources": "The comments themselves are the sources, providing licensing and copyright information.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data flows present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist, as the code contains only comments without executable statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual code behaviors are present; the code is straightforward metadata.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is purely metadata with no executable code, data flows, or data sinks. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the content. No logical errors or flaws are evident, and the assessments are consistent with the code's nature. The comments serve as licensing information and pose no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign license headers with no malicious or suspicious content. The assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate, reflecting the absence of security risks, malware, or obfuscation.",
