  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for working with MIDI messages, ports, files, and related operations, facilitating MIDI data processing and communication in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (ports, sockets, backend, messages, midifiles, parser, syx, version). No external input sources are explicitly read in this file; it mainly defines functions, constants, and module-level setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs to untrusted destinations are present. No data leaks, network transmissions, or system modifications are observed in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code sets up backend functions and defines an API, but does not perform data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The set_backend() function dynamically assigns backend methods, which could influence subsequent behavior but does not directly process untrusted input here.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically assigns functions from a backend module to the global namespace, which could potentially be manipulated if the backend module is compromised. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are evident. The presence of license comments and detailed API documentation appears standard.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step, the code imports internal modules and defines an API for MIDI operations. The set_backend() function dynamically replaces certain functions with those from a specified backend, which could theoretically be exploited if the backend is malicious, but this is a designed feature for flexibility. No code indicates malicious activity like data exfiltration, system modification, or code injection. The code primarily facilitates MIDI data handling and does not process untrusted input directly. The dynamic function assignment based on backend modules is common in plugin architectures and does not inherently imply malicious intent. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard MIDI handling interface with dynamic backend configuration. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident within this code segment. The main concern lies in the backend modules that can replace core functions, which could be exploited if the backend is malicious, but this is a controlled and expected design pattern. Overall, the code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
