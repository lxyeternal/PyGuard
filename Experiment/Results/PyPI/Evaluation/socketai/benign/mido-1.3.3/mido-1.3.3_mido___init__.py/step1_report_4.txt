{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python library for working with MIDI messages, ports, and files, facilitating MIDI communication, parsing, and file handling.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from MIDI devices via open_input(), parsing MIDI message bytes, and reading SYX files.",
  "sinks": "Sending MIDI messages through open_output() ports, writing SYX files, and potentially logging or printing message data.",
  "flows": "Input data from MIDI devices -> parsed by parser or read functions -> processed or forwarded to output ports or file functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated code detected. The code primarily consists of function definitions, class imports, and port/file handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines functions, and sets up backend configurations for MIDI handling. No input validation or network communication is present that could lead to data exfiltration. The set_backend() function dynamically assigns backend methods, but it does so based on supplied parameters or default settings, with no evidence of malicious logic. No suspicious loops, dynamic code execution, or data leaks are evident. The structure appears standard for a MIDI processing library, with no embedded or hidden malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate MIDI processing library with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It provides functions and class imports typical for such a library, with no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
