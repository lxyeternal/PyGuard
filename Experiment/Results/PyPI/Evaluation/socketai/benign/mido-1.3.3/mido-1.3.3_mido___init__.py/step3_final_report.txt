  "purpose": "A MIDI utility library providing functions for creating, parsing, and handling MIDI messages, ports, files, and related data streams.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules such as ports, sockets, backend, messages, midifiles, parser, syx, and version; no external untrusted input sources are directly processed.",
  "sinks": "No evidence of data leaks, network transmissions, or malicious data exfiltration; primarily internal data processing and file handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from files, ports, and parsing functions into MIDI message objects; dynamic backend functions are assigned to replace global functions, enabling plugin-like extensibility.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable pattern is the dynamic `set_backend()` function, which loads backend modules and replaces global functions. This is a common plugin architecture pattern but could be exploited if malicious backend modules are supplied.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured MIDI utility library with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The dynamic backend loading pattern is standard in plugin systems but introduces a potential attack surface if untrusted modules are loaded. No network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage mechanisms are present. The code's clarity and lack of suspicious constructs support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe and free of malicious intent. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of backend modules loaded dynamically. In a controlled environment with trusted modules, the risk is minimal. The pattern used is standard and not inherently malicious.",
