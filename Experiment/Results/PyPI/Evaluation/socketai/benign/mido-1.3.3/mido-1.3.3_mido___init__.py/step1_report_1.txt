  "purpose": "This code provides a Python library for working with MIDI data, including creating, parsing, and handling MIDI messages, files, ports, and related data.",
  "sources": "Data is read from external MIDI files, SYX files, and input ports. Inputs include file reads, port streams, and string parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur if untrusted data is parsed or sent through MIDI streams, but no external data is explicitly sent or received within this code. No network or system modifications are directly performed.",
  "flows": "External data (files or port streams) flows into parsing functions (parse, parse_all, parse_string, parse_string_stream). The data is processed internally into MIDI message objects. Data can be sent through ports using send().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. The code mostly defines classes, functions, and setup routines. The set_backend() function dynamically overrides global functions with backend implementations, which is normal for plugin architectures but warrants attention if backend code is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of imports, function definitions, and configuration for a MIDI handling library. The only dynamic code is the set_backend() function, which replaces global functions with backend-specific implementations. The backend module is dynamically imported or set, which could be risky if the backend module is malicious, but this is an expected plugin pattern. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, network calls, or system modifications are present. The code does not perform any data exfiltration, remote control, or harmful actions directly. The potential concern lies in the dynamic backend loading, which depends on external modules; however, this pattern alone is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured MIDI utility library with no explicit malicious behavior. The dynamic backend setting is typical for plugin architectures, but it introduces dependency on external modules. No signs of malware, suspicious data handling, or malicious sabotage are evident within this snippet. Overall, the code is benign but depends on the safety of backend modules.",
