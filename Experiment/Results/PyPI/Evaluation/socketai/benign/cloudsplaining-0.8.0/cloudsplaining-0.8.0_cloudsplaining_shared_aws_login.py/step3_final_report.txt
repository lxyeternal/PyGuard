  "purpose": "Provides AWS session, client, resource management utilities, and role assumption functions for cross-account access.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LOCALSTACK_ENDPOINT_URL' for local testing; AWS SDK calls for creating clients, resources, and assuming roles.",
  "sinks": "AWS SDK calls that could potentially be redirected via environment variables; no direct data leaks or malicious network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables and function parameters flows into AWS SDK calls for client/resource creation and role assumption.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'LOCALSTACK_ENDPOINT_URL' for endpoint override, which is typical for testing but could be exploited if environment is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard boto3 patterns for AWS SDK interactions. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. Environment variable 'LOCALSTACK_ENDPOINT_URL' is used for local testing, which is common but could be manipulated in untrusted environments. Credential handling via assume_role is standard and secure. Logging is minimal and appropriate. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard AWS utility module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The use of environment variables for endpoint configuration is typical for testing purposes and does not indicate malicious activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to environment variable reliance, which is acceptable given the context.",
