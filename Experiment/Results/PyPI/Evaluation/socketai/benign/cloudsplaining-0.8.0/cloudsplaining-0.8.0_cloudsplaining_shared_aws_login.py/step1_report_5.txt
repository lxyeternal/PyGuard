  "purpose": "Utility functions for AWS authentication and resource management using boto3",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LOCALSTACK_ENDPOINT_URL), input parameters (service, profile, region, account IDs, role names), and boto3 session methods",
  "sinks": "Sensitive credentials (AccessKeyId, SecretAccessKey, SessionToken) returned by get_target_account_credentials",
  "flows": "Input parameters (profile, role, account ID) influence session creation and assume_role; credentials flow from assume_role response to return statement",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of assume_role and environment variables is standard but could pose security risks if misused outside context",
  "analysis": "The code provides AWS login utilities, creating boto3 clients, resources, and managing cross-account role assumption. Credentials are retrieved from AWS STS assume_role call and returned securely. No hardcoded secrets are present. The environment variable LOCALSTACK_ENDPOINT_URL is used for local testing. The code follows typical patterns for AWS SDK usage. The access credentials are only obtained and returned when explicitly calling get_target_account_credentials, which is standard practice. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard AWS utility module for managing credentials, sessions, and resources. It does not contain malicious or suspicious code. The use of environment variables and session management is typical. No indicators of malware or malicious intent are present.",
