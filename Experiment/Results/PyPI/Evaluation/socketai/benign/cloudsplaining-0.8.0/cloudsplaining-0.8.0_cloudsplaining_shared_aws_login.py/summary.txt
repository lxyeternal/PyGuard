  "conclusion": "The code is a standard AWS utility module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The use of environment variables for endpoint configuration is typical for testing purposes and does not indicate malicious activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to environment variable reliance, which is acceptable given the context."
