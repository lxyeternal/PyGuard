  "purpose": "Configuration setup for AWS IAM security analysis, including loading YAML files, defining constants, and setting risk levels.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'shared/default-exclusions.yml' YAML configuration file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; static data used for configuration purposes.",
  "flows": "Loading YAML configuration during module initialization; static data definitions used throughout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward static configuration code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static configuration loading and defines constants for IAM security assessment. It imports standard libraries, loads a YAML file, and defines various data structures. There are no network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation patterns. The YAML file loading could be a vector if the file is maliciously replaced, but this is external to the code itself. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static configuration for an IAM security tool, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only potential security concern is the integrity of the external YAML file, which is outside the scope of this code review. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), consistent with the nature of static configuration code.",
