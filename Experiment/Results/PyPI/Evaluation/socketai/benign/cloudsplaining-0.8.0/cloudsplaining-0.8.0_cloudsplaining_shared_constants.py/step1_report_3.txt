{
  "purpose": "The code defines configuration data, constants, and schemas for an AWS IAM security analysis tool, specifically for cloud permissions assessment and risk evaluation.",
  "sources": "File system (reading default-exclusions.yml), environment variables (indirectly via os.path), static data embedded in the code.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes to external systems or executes untrusted commands directly. It primarily loads static data and configurations.",
  "flows": "No active data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code loads configuration files and defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be configuration and schema definitions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules (logging, os, yaml) and a shared validation module. It constructs file paths, loads YAML configuration files, and performs schema validation. It defines numerous constants, such as IAM actions, risk levels, and policy templates, intended for security analysis. No dynamic execution, network activity, or obfuscated elements are present. The code functions as static configuration data for security assessment purposes. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident in this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration and schema definition for an AWS IAM security assessment tool. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or malware. It appears safe and intended for security evaluation purposes.",
