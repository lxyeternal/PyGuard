  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a configuration setup for an AWS IAM security tool, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. It loads YAML, defines constants, and risk levels.\n- **Assessment:** The code is static, standard, and contains no suspicious patterns. The YAML loading is typical for configuration management.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, as it's configuration code.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static configuration, no malicious activity, standard YAML loading.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious intent. YAML file reading could be a concern if the file were malicious, but that's standard practice.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — still very low, justified given the nature of static configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid; no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Static configuration, constants, schemas, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely configuration and schema definitions.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — appropriate for static data.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct; safe code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, static data, configuration templates, no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with static configuration.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Static configuration, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** All data is static, with YAML configuration loading, typical for such tools.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** No. All reports correctly identify that the code is static configuration data, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with straightforward static data.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1–0.2), justified given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- The code appears to be a standard configuration module for an AWS IAM security assessment tool.\n- There are no signs of supply chain sabotage, malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The YAML configuration loading is typical and does not introduce security risks unless the external YAML file is malicious, which is outside the scope of this static code review.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — the lowest reasonable score, given the static nature and purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, well-structured, and intended for configuration purposes only. No adjustments are necessary.",
