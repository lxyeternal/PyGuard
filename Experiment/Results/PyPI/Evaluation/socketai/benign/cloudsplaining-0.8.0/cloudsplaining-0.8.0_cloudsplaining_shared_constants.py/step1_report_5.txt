{
  "purpose": "The code provides configuration data, policy templates, and constants related to AWS IAM security assessments, including exclusion schemas, risk definitions, and action lists for security analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files (default-exclusions.yml), defines static variables, and templates within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "Uses open() to read external YAML files; does not process untrusted input directly; no network or system command execution present.",
  "flows": "Configuration data is loaded from files; no flow from untrusted input to sensitive functions or data exfiltration points observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of hardcoded strings in lists and templates appears intentional and benign; no evidence of obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a YAML configuration file and performs schema validation, which is standard for configuration management. It defines several constants and templates for AWS IAM security analysis, including policy exclusions, risk categories, and sensitive actions. No functions or dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to serve as a static configuration resource without malicious intent. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or sabotage. All data handling is straightforward, with no unsafe operations or obfuscated patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static configuration module containing policy templates and security constants for AWS IAM assessments. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code. It appears to be a benign part of a security analysis tool.",
