  "conclusion": "The code is benign static configuration for an IAM security tool, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only potential security concern is the integrity of the external YAML file, which is outside the scope of this code review. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), consistent with the nature of static configuration code."
