{
  "purpose": "The code sets up configuration templates, constants, and policies for AWS security analysis, particularly focusing on IAM permissions, risk assessment, and data exfiltration detection.",
  "sources": "File system reading the YAML configuration file (shared/default-exclusions.yml), environment variables, imported modules (logging, os, yaml, validation functions).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks like network calls, system modifications, or credential leaks are present. The code primarily defines data structures and static configurations.",
  "flows": "The YAML configuration is loaded from the filesystem during initialization; the rest are static data definitions used for analysis and policy management.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard libraries and constructs for configuration management and policy definitions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be part of an AWS security assessment tool, focusing on IAM policy analysis. It loads configuration data, defines common IAM actions, severity levels, and risk descriptions. All operations involve static data and configuration management without any network activity, credential handling, or execution of untrusted code. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or supply chain sabotage. The code is well-structured, using standard libraries, and only performs configuration loading and static data initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a configuration and data setup module for an AWS IAM security analysis tool. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It appears legitimate and safe, focusing on policy evaluation and risk assessment without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
