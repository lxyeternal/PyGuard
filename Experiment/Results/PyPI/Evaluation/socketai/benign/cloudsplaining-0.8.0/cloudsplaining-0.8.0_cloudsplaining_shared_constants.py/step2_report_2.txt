  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is purely configuration and static data, with no network, credential, or execution of untrusted code. The YAML load is standard and does not pose a security risk unless the YAML file is maliciously replaced, which is outside the scope of the code itself.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, given the code's static nature and configuration purpose)\n- **Comments:** The high confidence (0.95) aligns with the straightforward analysis. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it loads a configuration file and defines static data. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are evident.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (still low, given static data and configuration role)\n- **Comments:** The confidence is slightly lower (0.9), but overall consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, static configuration and data definitions, no dynamic or malicious operations.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Comments:** Perfect confidence (1), no issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Static configuration data, no suspicious code, no network or credential handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, given static configuration role)\n- **Comments:** Confidence is high (1), consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—configuration data, YAML loading, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low)\n- **Comments:** High confidence (1), consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0. The code is purely static configuration data with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk:** Given the static, non-executable nature of the code, a low risk score (~0.1) is justified across all reports.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's purpose.\n- No changes are necessary; the analysis aligns with the code's static, configuration-only role.\n- The high confidence levels are justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThis code does not pose any supply chain or security risk beyond standard configuration management.",
