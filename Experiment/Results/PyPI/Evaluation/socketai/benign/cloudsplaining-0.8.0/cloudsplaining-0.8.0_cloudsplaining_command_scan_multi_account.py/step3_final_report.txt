  "purpose": "The script scans multiple AWS accounts via AssumeRole, retrieves authorization details, and generates HTML and JSON reports stored locally or on S3.",
  "sources": "Configuration files, environment variables, user inputs, credentials fetched via aws_login functions.",
  "sinks": "Uploads to S3, writes to local files, logs progress.",
  "flows": "Data flows from configs and inputs into credential retrieval, account authorization details, report generation, and storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard AWS SDK practices, handles credentials securely, and performs expected operations without malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious network activity is present. The logic is straightforward, with clear data flow from configuration to report storage. No anomalies or security issues are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate AWS security auditing tool with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It employs standard libraries and practices, handles credentials securely, and generates reports without suspicious activity. The low scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are justified and appropriate.",
