  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code is a simple class definition inheriting from `Exception`, with a descriptive docstring.\n   - No data inputs, external dependencies, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security-sensitive operations are detected.\n   - All reports agree that this is a benign, standard custom exception class.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is straightforward and benign.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n   - They appropriately classify the code as harmless, with no security risks.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's simplicity and the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is a simple exception class with no malicious behavior, the `malware` score of 0 is justified.\n   - The `securityRisk` score of 0 is also justified, as there's no security concern.\n   - No reason exists to elevate these scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward observations; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n   - The analysis correctly interprets the code as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a minimal, standard custom exception class with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary to the scores or analysis.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:\n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\nThis code poses no security threat or malware risk.",
