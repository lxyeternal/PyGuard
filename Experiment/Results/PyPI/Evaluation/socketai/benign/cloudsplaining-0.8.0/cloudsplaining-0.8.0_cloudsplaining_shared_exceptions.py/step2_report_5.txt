  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The original code is a simple class definition inheriting from Exception, with a descriptive docstring.\n   - All reports confirm that the code is straightforward, with no data inputs, external calls, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and does not contain issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly agree that the code is a standard, benign exception class.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - The assessments correctly identify the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - **Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - The code poses no security threat, so a higher score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code is a simple exception class with no malicious behavior.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - No hidden or malicious code is present.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions; they recognize the code's simplicity.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are raised.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n### Reasoning summary:\nThe code is a minimal, standard custom exception class with no data handling, external dependencies, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. Therefore, the scores reflect the true security posture.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.",
