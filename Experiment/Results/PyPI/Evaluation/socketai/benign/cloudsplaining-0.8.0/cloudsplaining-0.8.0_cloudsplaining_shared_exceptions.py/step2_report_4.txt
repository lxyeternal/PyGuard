  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Actual Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - The code contains no data inputs, external calls, or data handling operations.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The class is straightforward, with a descriptive docstring and a comment to suppress a linter warning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score is 0, which is justified.\n   - No reason to assign a higher risk since there's no malicious activity, no external data handling, and no security-sensitive operations.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly assign `malware` as 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or behaviors.\n   - No change needed.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to the facts.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a standard pattern for custom exceptions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a straightforward, benign custom exception class.\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No issues or concerns are present.\n\n**My Own Estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis, as there's no malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Final Note:** The reports are thorough and correct. The scores are appropriate, and no further action or adjustments are necessary.",
