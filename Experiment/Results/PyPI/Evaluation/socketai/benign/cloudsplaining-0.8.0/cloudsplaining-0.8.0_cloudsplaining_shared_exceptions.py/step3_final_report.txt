  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for not found errors.",
  "sources": "Class definition inheriting from Exception, no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; class is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class is a static exception declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class with docstring and linter comment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class with no data inputs, external dependencies, or complex control flows. It contains a docstring explaining its purpose and a linter suppression comment. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The class is standard and benign, with no data flows or external interactions. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a low likelihood of malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
