  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard for defining a custom exception.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single class 'NotFoundException' inheriting from Python's Exception, with a docstring explaining its purpose. It includes a comment about a linter override. There are no data inputs, external calls, or suspicious constructs. It is a minimal, standard pattern for custom exceptions, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard custom exception definition with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
