  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the corresponding code snippet.\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\nclass NotFoundException(Exception):  # noqa: N818\n    \"Raised when something was not found\"\n```\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from Python's built-in Exception.\n- It includes a docstring explaining its purpose.\n- There are no data inputs, external data reads, or complex control flows.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All reports uniformly state that the code is a straightforward, benign class definition.\n- They note the absence of data flows, external dependencies, or suspicious patterns.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty that the code is safe.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Logical flaws or errors:**\n- All reports correctly identify that this is a simple exception class with no malicious or security concerns.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the conclusions are consistent.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final critical evaluation:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code is correct and follows standard Python practices.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; scores correctly reflect this.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present; scores correctly assigned.\n- **Risk assessment:** The risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is a minimal, standard custom exception class with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** This is a textbook example of a benign, straightforward class definition with no issues.",
