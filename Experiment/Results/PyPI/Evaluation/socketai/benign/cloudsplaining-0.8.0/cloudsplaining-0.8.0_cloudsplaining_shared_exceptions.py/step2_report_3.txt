  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the consistency of their assessments.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code snippet is a simple class definition:\n     ```python\n     class NotFoundException(Exception):  # noqa: N818\n         \"Raised when something was not found\"\n     ```\n   - There are no data inputs, external calls, or data flows.\n   - No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n   - All reports correctly identify that this is a benign, standard custom exception class.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their reasoning.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data handling, external dependencies, or malicious code.\n   - No report makes an unreasonable claim; all recognize the code as benign.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is a straightforward exception class with no suspicious activity, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - All reports correctly assign low scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is correct.\n   - No malicious behavior is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, standard Python exception class with no data handling, external dependencies, or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate low scores.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the collective analysis and the code's benign nature.",
