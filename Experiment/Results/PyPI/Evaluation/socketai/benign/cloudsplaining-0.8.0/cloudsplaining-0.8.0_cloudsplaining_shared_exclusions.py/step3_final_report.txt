  "purpose": "Manages the exclusions template for scanning the Authorizations file",
  "sources": "Reads configuration lists for roles, users, groups, policies, include-actions, and exclude-actions; uses string comparisons and wildcards.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or data leaks; internal functions for matching and logging.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows into normalization functions, then into exclusion checks via is_name_excluded, with potential source-to-sink paths in matching logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard string matching, normalization, and logging are used. Wildcard handling is typical for exclusion lists.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward exclusion management, normalizing input lists and matching names with optional wildcards. It includes logging for debugging but no external or malicious operations. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The functions are simple, with clear logic, and no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, configuration-driven exclusion utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It performs standard filtering with safe practices. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with its behavior.",
