{
  "purpose": "Manages and evaluates exclusions for scanning authorizations, policies, and principals in security configurations.",
  "sources": "Configuration data from 'exclusions_config', potentially external data if passed; user input for action names, policies, principals, and other identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Function calls like 'is_name_excluded', 'print_grey' for logging, and 'check_exclusions_schema' for validation; no data leaks or unsafe operations are directly evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (policy names, actions, principals) through normalization and exclusion checks, resulting in boolean decisions or filtered lists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. The code performs standard normalization and exclusion logic. Logging is limited to debug messages for exclusions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs configuration validation and manages exclusion lists for actions, policies, and principals. It normalizes inputs for comparison, checks for exact matches or prefix/suffix wildcards, and returns exclusion decisions. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity is present. The use of utility functions like 'print_grey' for internal debugging does not pose security risks. The class design is typical for configuration management, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign component responsible for managing exclusions in a security scanning context. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical security configuration handling.",
