  "purpose": "Manages exclusions for scanning authorizations, policies, and principals to filter out certain actions, policies, users, groups, and roles based on a configuration.",
  "sources": "Configuration input via exclusions_config parameter; config.get() method calls for 'roles', 'users', 'groups', 'policies', 'include-actions', 'exclude-actions'.",
  "sinks": "Functions like is_name_excluded() that process names against exclusion lists; utility functions such as utils.print_grey() used for logging/explanation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from config inputs into internal normalized lists; functions check names against these lists; is_name_excluded() compares input names with exclusions; get_allowed_actions filters actions based on exclusions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of utility print_grey() within exclusion checks for prefix/suffix matching, which is benign. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are present. No obfuscation or unusual code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for handling exclusions, normalizing input data, and checking whether specific actions, policies, or principals are excluded based on configuration. It uses standard string comparisons and prefix/suffix matching to determine exclusions. The functions are straightforward, with no external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious operations observed. Logging functions are used solely for debug purposes. The utility functions and constants are imported from the 'cloudsplaining' package, which appears to be a legitimate open-source security scanning tool. No malicious behavior, code injection, or sabotage indicators are present. The code focuses on managing internal exclusion logic without external side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs expected exclusion filtering for a security scanning tool with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily handles string comparisons and normalization, with no external network activity or hidden backdoors. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
