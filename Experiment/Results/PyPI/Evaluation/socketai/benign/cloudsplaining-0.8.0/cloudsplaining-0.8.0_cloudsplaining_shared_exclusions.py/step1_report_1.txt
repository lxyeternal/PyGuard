  "purpose": "Manages exclusions configuration for scanning authorizations, roles, users, groups, and policies in an AWS environment.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary 'exclusions_config' passed during initialization, and environment data via input parameters such as principal names and action strings.",
  "sinks": "Decision functions such as 'is_action_always_included', 'is_action_always_excluded', 'is_policy_excluded', 'is_principal_excluded', and 'get_allowed_actions' potentially influence access control logic.",
  "flows": "Input data (principal names, actions, policies) flows into exclusion check functions which compare against configured exclusion lists; results determine access permission decisions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic string matching with prefix/suffix wildcards in 'is_name_excluded' function. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Logging of exclusions may reveal configuration details, but this is typical for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an 'Exclusions' class that normalizes and manages exclusion lists for roles, users, groups, policies, and actions. Functions like 'is_name_excluded' perform case-insensitive matching, including prefix/suffix wildcards. The code primarily performs standard configuration-based filtering for access control. No external data fetching, network communication, or malicious code execution mechanisms are present. Logging is used for debug purposes and does not pose security risks. The structure appears standard for a configuration filtering module, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration management class for access exclusions with no indicators of malicious intent. It performs standard filtering operations without any suspicious or harmful behaviors. No malware or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
