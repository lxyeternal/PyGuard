{
  "purpose": "This code configures logging for the 'cloudsplaining' module, providing functions to set log levels and handlers dynamically.",
  "sources": "Function parameters for log level, name, and format string; logger and handler setup code.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs to stdout via StreamHandler; no external data sources or network sinks.",
  "flows": "Function calls to set_log_level or set_stream_logger lead to logger configuration changes; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; commented-out NullHandler is benign; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard logging setup with functions to adjust log levels and handlers. It does not process untrusted input, transmit data externally, or contain obfuscation or malicious code. The logger outputs to stdout, which could theoretically expose sensitive info if logs contain such data, but the code itself does not handle sensitive data. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe logging configuration module with no security issues or malicious intent. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
