{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for AWS resource and policy management, including data processing, string manipulation, file handling, and printing formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads from hardcoded imports, AWS ARNs, environment variables, YAML files, and function parameters. Uses external libraries such as 'policy_sentry' and 'yaml'.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations (write_results_data_file, write_file, write_json_to_file), print statements, and data hashing functions.",
  "flows": "Function inputs such as ARNs, strings, and data dictionaries are processed, transformed, or hashed; results are written to files or printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or reverse shells are observed. The code uses standard library functions and external APIs responsibly. No obfuscated or misleading code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a collection of utility functions for managing AWS policies and resources, including parsing ARNs, filtering actions, hashing resource identifiers, and handling files. It employs standard programming practices with no signs of malicious activity. The functions handle data securely and only perform file I/O, string processing, and data formatting. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or hidden backdoors are present. The use of external libraries for querying AWS actions appears legitimate. Overall, the code serves its utility purpose without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of utility functions intended for AWS policy and resource management. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It operates securely within its scope, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
