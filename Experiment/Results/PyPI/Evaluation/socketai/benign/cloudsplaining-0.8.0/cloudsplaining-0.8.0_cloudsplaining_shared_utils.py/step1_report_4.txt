  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling AWS IAM policies, ARNs, string manipulation, file operations, and YAML processing.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, input parameters (such as ARNs and lists), and files (YAML, JSON).",
  "sinks": "Writes to files (results data, JSON, general files), and outputs to stdout (print functions).",
  "flows": "Input data (ARNS, lists, files) are processed and then written or printed, with no untrusted data flowing into sensitive sinks in a dangerous way.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. Use of sha256 for hashing is standard. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or reverse shells are detected. Logging is benign. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for policy processing, string handling, file operations, and YAML/JSON parsing. It uses standard libraries and established patterns. Functions like 'remove_wildcard_only_actions' and 'remove_read_level_actions' invoke external libraries but do not contain malicious behavior. File reading/writing functions use safe methods without executing or evaluating untrusted code. Print functions simply output colored text. No evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The use of sha256 is a standard practice for anonymizing resource names. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for legitimate utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of utility functions with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It performs safe file I/O, string manipulation, and policy data handling without suspicious or harmful actions. No security risks are identified based on this code segment.",
