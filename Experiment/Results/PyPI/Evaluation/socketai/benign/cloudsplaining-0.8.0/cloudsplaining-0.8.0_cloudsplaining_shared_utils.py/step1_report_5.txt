  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling AWS IAM policies, resource ARNs, string manipulation, file I/O, and YAML processing.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters (e.g., ARNs, lists, file paths) and external files (YAML, JSON).",
  "sinks": "File writing operations (write_results_data_file, write_file, write_json_to_file), printing functions, external libraries (policy_sentry).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters or external files into functions, which may process, manipulate, and output to files or console; no external network or untrusted input processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, such as hidden network connections, code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Usage of 'sha256' is standard for hashing, and no hardcoded secrets are present. Logging and file I/O are straightforward and typical for utility scripts. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for string processing, ARN parsing, access level filtering, and file handling. Functions operate on provided parameters and perform standard operations such as string splitting, hashing, and file writing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network access, or backdoor mechanisms. The usage of external libraries appears legitimate for configuration and data management. The code structure is clear, with no suspicious or obfuscated code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a set of utility functions intended for policy and resource management, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious code. The code is standard, well-structured, and does not exhibit signs of malware or security risks.",
