  "purpose": "Utility functions for processing AWS resource ARNs, actions, and policy data, including file I/O and string manipulations.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from YAML files, string parameters (ARNs, actions), and existing files; retrieving action data via imported policy_sentry modules.",
  "sinks": "Writing data to files (JSON, text), printing colored output to console.",
  "flows": "Input data (ARNs, strings, files) -> processing functions -> output files or console output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sha256 hashing for resource IDs; no hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward utility functions aimed at processing AWS ARNs, actions, and policies. The only potential concern is the use of sha256 hashing for resource IDs, which is a standard practice for anonymization, not malicious activity. There are no indications of malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. File operations are standard. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. External libraries used are for policy data handling and YAML parsing, with no evident malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of benign utility functions for AWS resource and policy data processing, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It performs data handling, string manipulation, and file I/O in a typical manner. There is no evidence of security risks or malicious behavior.",
