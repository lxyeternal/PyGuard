  "purpose": "Utility functions for AWS policy and resource management, including ARN parsing, action filtering, file I/O, and string manipulation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, external AWS policy data, and files; no untrusted input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations, string processing, and hashing functions; no data leaks or external network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through parsing, filtering, hashing, and file writing functions; no suspicious source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of sha256 hashing for resource ID anonymization is standard; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises straightforward utility functions for AWS policy handling, including string parsing, list filtering, hashing, and file operations. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. External libraries are standard and used appropriately. The hashing functions serve benign purposes such as anonymization. No suspicious data flows or code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of utility functions for AWS policy and resource management with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent and justified.",
