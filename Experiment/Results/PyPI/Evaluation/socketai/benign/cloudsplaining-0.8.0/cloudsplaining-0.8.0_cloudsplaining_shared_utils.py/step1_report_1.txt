{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling AWS resource ARNs, policies, and actions, along with simple file and string operations, mainly for security policy analysis and reporting.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters such as ARNs, YAML files, lists of actions, and files; reads configuration files; reads and writes JSON and text files.",
  "sinks": "Writes results to files, outputs formatted strings to stdout, performs JSON serialization, and hashes data with sha256.",
  "flows": "Data from input sources (ARNS, files, lists) flows into functions that process and transform it, then outputs to files, logs, or console; no dangerous or untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious backdoors. Logging and printing are straightforward. All external dependencies are related to AWS policies, YAML, JSON, and standard libraries. No indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a collection of utility functions for processing AWS ARNs, policies, and actions, along with basic file and string operations. The functions perform standard data parsing, string manipulation, hashing, and file I/O. There is no evidence of malicious logic such as network communication, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Use of external libraries is appropriate and limited to policy querying, YAML parsing, and standard libraries. The functions do not process untrusted input in a way that would lead to injection vulnerabilities; all inputs are either parameters or files with expected formats. No obfuscated code or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of utility functions for AWS policy analysis and file handling, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe for its intended purpose.",
