  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and any potential concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe utility functions related to AWS policies, ARNs, actions, and file handling.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors are identified across reports.\n- External libraries used (policy_sentry, yaml, json, hashlib) are standard and appropriate.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or code injection detected.\n- Hashing with sha256 is used for resource ID anonymization, which is standard practice, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Clear, no malicious behavior, safe data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Scores seem appropriate. The low security risk reflects typical utility functions.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The security risk is minimal, given the functions' scope.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Uses sha256 hashing for resource IDs; standard for anonymization.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The use of sha256 is benign here. Slightly lower confidence is acceptable due to the hashing, but no malicious intent is evident.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Straightforward utility functions, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1 or 0), reflecting the utility nature of the code, with minimal security risk due to standard practices.\n- **Confidence levels:** High (1 or 0.9), consistent with the thorough analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a legitimate set of utility functions for AWS policy management.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- Scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My personal estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard utility functions with minor hashing for anonymization)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments.",
