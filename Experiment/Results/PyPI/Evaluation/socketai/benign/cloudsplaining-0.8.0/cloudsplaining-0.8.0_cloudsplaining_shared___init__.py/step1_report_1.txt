  "purpose": "Setup for logging configuration in a Python module",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name (__name__) for logger initialization",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed or outputted",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or processing occurs",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; standard logging setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports the logging module, disables a pylint warning, and creates a logger with the module's name. It does not include any data input, processing, or output beyond logger creation. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The code is minimal and typical for logging setup in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
