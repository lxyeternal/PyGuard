  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard schema validation utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only minor concern is the use of 'print' for error reporting, which does not impact security but should be replaced with proper logging for best practices. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the security risk is minimal. The scores across all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
