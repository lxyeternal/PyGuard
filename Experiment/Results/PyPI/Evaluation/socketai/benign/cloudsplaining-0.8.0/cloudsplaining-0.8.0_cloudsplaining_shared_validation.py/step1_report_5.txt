{
  "purpose": "The code validates JSON/YAML formatted templates/data against predefined schemas to ensure data integrity and correctness.",
  "sources": "The schemas defined for 'exclusions' and 'authorization details', and the input configuration dictionaries passed to validation functions.",
  "sinks": "The validation functions 'check', 'check_exclusions_schema', and 'check_authorization_details_schema' that process user data and potentially output error messages or raise exceptions.",
  "flows": "User-provided configuration data flows into validation functions, which validate data against schemas and output boolean results or exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for error reporting instead of logging; exception handling prints errors rather than raising or logging them in a structured manner. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs schema validation using the 'schema' library, with functions designed to validate input data structures. Error handling involves printing schema validation errors and raising exceptions for invalid exclusions schema. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of print statements for error reporting is suboptimal but not malicious. The overall logic is straightforward and safe, primarily focused on data validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard schema validation implementation with no malicious behavior or security risks. It handles user data validation with basic error reporting. The design is safe, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
