{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to validate JSON or YAML formatted templates and data structures such as exclusions templates and authorization details against predefined schemas.",
  "sources": "The data is read from function parameters 'conf' and 'cfg' which are user-supplied dictionaries, and from the schema validation functions.",
  "sinks": "The code's main potential sink is the 'check' function, which validates data against schemas and prints error messages if validation fails.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the user-supplied input (conf, cfg) into the check function, which validates it against the schema. Errors, if any, are printed to standard output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'print' for error reporting instead of proper logging, which may obscure errors in production environments. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines schemas for validation and uses a dedicated function 'check' to validate input data against these schemas. Error handling is performed via exception catching with print statements, which is not inherently malicious but suboptimal for production. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior is present. The code focuses solely on schema validation with no embedded malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward schema validation logic with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. The main concern is the use of 'print' for error reporting instead of a secure logging mechanism. Overall, it appears safe and free from malicious behavior.",
