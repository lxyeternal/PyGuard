{
  "purpose": "The code validates JSON/YAML formatted templates/data against predefined schemas for exclusions and authorization details.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data passed as dictionaries to the check functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include external data sinks or untrusted data effects; validation results are returned or exceptions raised.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries to schema validation functions; validation results are used for flow control.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. The only exception-raising is standard validation error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a schema validation library to verify data structures, with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or obfuscated logic. Validation errors are caught and logged or raise exceptions. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The functions perform straightforward validation and error handling. The logging setup is standard, and no external data transmission or sensitive data handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data validation utility with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. It performs schema validation and error reporting securely. No security threats or malicious behaviors identified.",
