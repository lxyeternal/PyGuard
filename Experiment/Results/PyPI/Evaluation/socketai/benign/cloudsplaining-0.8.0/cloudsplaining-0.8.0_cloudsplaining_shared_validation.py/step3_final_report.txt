  "purpose": "Validate JSON/YAML formatted templates/data, such as the exclusions template and the Authorization details file.",
  "sources": "The code reads schema definitions and user-supplied configuration data for validation.",
  "sinks": "The validation functions process input data; no sinks that lead to data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated against schemas; errors are caught and printed, but no external data flows or malicious actions occur.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'print' statements for error reporting instead of proper logging; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward schema validation using the 'schema' library. Error handling relies on exception catching and printing error messages, which is suboptimal but not malicious. No external system interactions, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are evident. The validation functions check configurations against predefined schemas and handle errors gracefully. The overall logic is simple and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard schema validation utility with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only minor concern is the use of 'print' for error reporting, which does not impact security but should be replaced with proper logging for best practices. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the security risk is minimal. The scores across all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
