{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to validate JSON/YAML formatted templates or data structures against predefined schemas for exclusions and authorization details.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data passed as dictionaries to the check functions, which are validated against schema objects.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the validation process which could raise exceptions or print error messages if data does not conform; no direct data leaks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries through the check function which validates against schemas; validation results are returned or exceptions raised.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs straightforward validation with no unusual or suspicious code patterns. The use of print statements for errors is standard for debugging but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines schemas for expected data formats, and provides functions to validate data against these schemas. The check function handles exceptions and outputs error messages. No suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of print for error reporting is typical but not malicious. The overall design is safe and intended for data validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate schema validation for configuration data. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No security risks are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward, safe validation utility.",
