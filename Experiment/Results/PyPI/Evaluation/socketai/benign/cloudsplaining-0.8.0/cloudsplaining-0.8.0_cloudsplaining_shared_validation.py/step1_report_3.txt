{
  "purpose": "The code validates JSON/YAML data structures against predefined schemas to ensure correct format and structure.",
  "sources": "Input data is expected to come from external configuration files or user input, passed into validation functions.",
  "sinks": "Validation functions validate data in memory; no direct output or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Data is passed into 'check', then validated against schemas; no external data flow or dangerous operations are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. Use of exception handling is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and schema validation tools. It defines schemas for exclusions and authorization details. Validation functions check data against schemas, printing errors and raising exceptions if validation fails. The code appears to solely focus on schema validation without performing any other operations or external interactions. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity is identified. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. It operates within typical validation roles, with appropriate exception handling and logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign validation module used to ensure configuration data conforms to expected schemas. There is no indication of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
