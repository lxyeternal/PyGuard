  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'cloudsplaining' Python package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'cloudsplaining/bin/version.py', reads description from 'README.md', and includes package data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable manipulation detected.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and description files, then passes data to setuptools.setup() for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic observed. Use of regex and file reads are standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard package setup tasks, such as reading version and description files, and configuring package metadata and dependencies. No external inputs are directly processed in a way that could lead to security issues. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It reads package metadata from local files and configures package installation parameters safely.",
