  "purpose": "Set up configuration and metadata for the 'cloudsplaining' Python package, including version retrieval, dependencies, and package info.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from 'cloudsplaining/bin/version.py' and description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data or external outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Read version file -> Extract version string; Read README file -> Use as long description; No data flow to untrusted sources or sinks beyond standard setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; use of regular expressions, file reads, and standard package setup procedures are typical. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads version info from a specific file, reads the package description from a Markdown file, and defines dependencies and metadata. No code injection, malicious network activity, or suspicious code structures are present. The use of regular expressions and file reads are straightforward. The package metadata indicates legitimate project details and author contact info. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical configuration tasks safely.",
