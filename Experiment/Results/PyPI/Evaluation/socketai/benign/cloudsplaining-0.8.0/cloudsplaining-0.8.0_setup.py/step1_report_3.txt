  "purpose": "This code is for setting up and configuring a Python package named 'cloudsplaining', including defining dependencies, package metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading of version information from 'cloudsplaining/bin/version.py' and description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "Potential reading from external files that could be manipulated, but no data is written or transmitted; no sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads external files for version and description, then uses this data for package setup configuration without further processing or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code is standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and uses regex to parse version info. It reads 'version.py' and 'README.md' for data, then calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata and configuration. All operations are typical for package setup and involve reading static files. No untrusted data processing, malicious behaviors, or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It reads package metadata from files and uses standard setup procedures. No anomalies, malware, or security threats are present.",
