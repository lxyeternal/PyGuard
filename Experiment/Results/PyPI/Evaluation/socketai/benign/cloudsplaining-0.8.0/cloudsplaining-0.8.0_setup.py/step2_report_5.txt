  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Reads version from local file, no external data or untrusted sources.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data transmitted externally; local file reads are safe.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or behavior.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard setup script, no malicious or suspicious activity detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard package setup with no external data manipulation or suspicious code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Also consistent with previous findings: reads local files, no external data, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Reiterates the same observations: local file reads, standard setup procedures, no anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same conclusion: straightforward setup script, no external data or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0 — appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code content:** All reports describe a typical, well-structured Python package setup script.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.  \n- **Security risk:** None apparent; the script only reads local files and configures package metadata.  \n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**; no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**; code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** Should be **0**; standard package setup poses no security threat.  \n\n### Additional notes:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified here; the code is static and safe.  \n- The dependency and URL listings are legitimate and typical for open-source projects.  \n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThe reports are consistent, and the code is benign. No further action needed.",
