{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python package setup script that reads version and description files, then configures package metadata using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'cloudsplaining/bin/version.py' and description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is transmitted or processed in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Reads local files for version and description, then passes data to setuptools.setup() without external or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: importing modules, reading static files for version and description, and invoking setuptools.setup() with metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data processing is present. The regex is used solely to extract version info, which is standard. The code structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All signals indicate a benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
