  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for the 'cloudsplaining' Python package, defining dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from 'cloudsplaining/bin/version.py' and the README.md file.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data processing or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Version extraction reads local files; no flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: importing modules, reading local files for version and description, and calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. Dependencies are explicitly listed, and URLs point to official repositories and documentation. The structure and content are typical for a setup script, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious anomalies.",
