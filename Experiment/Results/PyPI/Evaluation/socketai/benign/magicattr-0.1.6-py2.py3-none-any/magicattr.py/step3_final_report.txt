  "purpose": "Utility functions for nested attribute access, modification, and deletion supporting complex expressions via AST parsing, with safeguards against code injection.",
  "sources": "AST parsing of attribute strings, _parse function, and lookup functions processing attribute expressions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not perform data leaks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Attribute string input -> AST parsing -> Node analysis -> _lookup/_lookup_subscript_value -> attribute or index access on objects.",
  "anomalies": "Explicitly disallows function call nodes (ast.Call), preventing code execution. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides safe nested attribute access/modification by parsing attribute expressions with AST, explicitly disallowing function calls to prevent code injection. It handles various node types, supports negative indices, and processes dict/list keys. No malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors are present. The main security concern is potential misuse if attribute strings are untrusted, but safeguards mitigate this risk. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, security-conscious utility for nested attribute handling. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk score (0.2) is appropriate, considering potential misuse with untrusted input, but overall, it is safe for use.",
