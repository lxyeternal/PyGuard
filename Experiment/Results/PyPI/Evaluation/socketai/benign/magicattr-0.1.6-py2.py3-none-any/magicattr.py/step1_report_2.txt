{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for nested attribute, item, and key access and modification on objects, dicts, and lists, supporting string-based attribute expressions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from the 'attr' parameter in functions get(), set(), delete(), and lookup(), which are parsed into AST nodes.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks where untrusted data directly leads to security breaches, as the functions only perform attribute access, assignment, or deletion on provided objects. No external system calls, network communication, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input 'attr' strings through parsing into AST nodes, which are then used to perform attribute or item lookups on the target objects. No malicious data flow pathways are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code parses attribute strings into AST nodes but explicitly raises errors on function call nodes, preventing dynamic execution via 'eval'. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The function _lookup_subscript_value supports negative indexing, but this is standard Python behavior. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs AST parsing to interpret attribute expressions safely, disallowing function calls to prevent code execution. The functions support nested lookups and modifications, with error handling for unsupported node types. No network operations, system modifications, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a utility module for nested attribute manipulation with security-conscious design choices. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for nested attribute and item manipulation using AST parsing. It includes safeguards against function call execution, indicating an emphasis on security. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified.",
