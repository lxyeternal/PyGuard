{
  "purpose": "Provides nested attribute access and modification functions for objects, dicts, and lists using string expressions parsed into AST nodes.",
  "sources": "Input attribute strings parsed into AST nodes for get, set, delete, and lookup functions.",
  "sinks": "None directly; the code performs attribute access and modification without executing untrusted code or performing network operations.",
  "flows": "Input attribute strings -> parsed into AST nodes -> used to access or modify object attributes or items.",
  "anomalies": "The code supports nested attribute and subscript expressions, but explicitly disallows function calls in AST nodes, which is a security measure. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements safe nested attribute access and modification via AST parsing. It explicitly prevents function calls within AST nodes, reducing risk of arbitrary code execution. There are no network operations, file manipulations, or other malicious behaviors. The functions handle exceptions gracefully with default fallbacks. Overall, the code appears to be a utility module for safe nested lookups with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a safe utility for nested attribute and item access/modification using string expressions. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It appropriately restricts function call execution within AST nodes. The overall security risk is very low.",
