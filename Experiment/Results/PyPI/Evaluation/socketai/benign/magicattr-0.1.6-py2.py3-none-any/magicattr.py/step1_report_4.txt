  "purpose": "Utility functions for nested attribute access, setting, and deletion in Python objects, supporting complex attribute and key lookups.",
  "sources": "Parsing attribute strings into AST nodes, reading attribute strings via get, set, delete, and lookup functions.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; functions manipulate object attributes or dict keys, which could be influenced by external input if attribute strings are user-controlled.",
  "flows": "User provides attribute string -> _parse converts to AST nodes -> _lookup or get/set performs attribute/dict/key access based on AST nodes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of AST parsing to interpret attribute strings could be manipulated if input is untrusted; however, the code restricts function calls in AST nodes. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for nested attribute manipulation, employing AST parsing to interpret attribute strings. Functions like get, set, delete, and lookup operate on objects, dicts, or lists. The _parse function parses attribute expressions into AST nodes, and _lookup and _lookup_subscript_value perform safe attribute/key retrieval. The code explicitly raises exceptions if unsupported nodes or function calls are encountered, preventing arbitrary code execution via AST. The use of AST parsing on potentially untrusted input could be a concern if external input influences attribute strings, but the code itself does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or invoke malicious functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a utility library for nested attribute access and modification with proper safeguards against executing function calls or unsupported nodes. No malicious behavior, malware, or suspicious operations are evident. The primary risk relates to misuse if untrusted attribute strings are provided externally, but the code does not directly facilitate or contain malicious payloads.",
