  "purpose": "Calculate approximate sunrise and sunset times for a given location and date.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: lat, lon, at_date, time_zone.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in a way that leaks or harms the system.",
  "flows": "Input data (lat, lon, date, timezone) flows through calculations to produce sunrise/sunset times.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated methods with warnings; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs astronomical calculations based on standard formulas for sun positions. It uses input parameters and computes sunrise/sunset times without interacting with external sources or executing untrusted code. The only potential concern is the deprecated warning methods, which are benign and do not pose security risks. No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for calculating sunrise and sunset times without malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The overall security risk is negligible.",
