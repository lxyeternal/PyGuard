  "purpose": "Provides calculation of sunrise and sunset times for given geographic coordinates and date.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as lat, lon, at_date, and time_zone; internal datetime and math operations.",
  "sinks": "Returns datetime objects representing sunrise and sunset times.",
  "flows": "Input coordinates and date are processed to compute sun times, which are then returned as datetime objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or obfuscated code, no hidden network activity, and no unusual data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs mathematical calculations to approximate sun times based on geographic coordinates and date. It uses standard Python libraries and performs no network operations, file I/O, or environment variable access that could be malicious. The only potential concern is the use of warnings and deprecated methods, but these are benign. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms present.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a legitimate astronomical calculation tool with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It does not include any suspicious code or security risks beyond standard computational logic.",
