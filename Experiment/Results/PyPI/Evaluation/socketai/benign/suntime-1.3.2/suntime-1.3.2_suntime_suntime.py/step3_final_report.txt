  "purpose": "Approximate calculation of sunrise and sunset times based on geographic coordinates and date, using standard astronomical formulas.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as latitude, longitude, date, and timezone; internal calculations based on astronomical formulas.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network activity; outputs are datetime objects representing sunrise and sunset times.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through mathematical formulas to produce timedelta offsets, which are combined with date and timezone to generate datetime outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated warning methods, which are benign; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-known astronomical calculations for sunrise and sunset times using only standard Python libraries. It handles edge cases where the sun does not rise or set, raising exceptions accordingly. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior is present. The deprecated warnings are harmless and serve to inform users about outdated methods. The calculations are straightforward and based on established formulas, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is a transparent, benign utility for astronomical calculations with no malicious or security concerns. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of suspicious behavior. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting its safe nature.",
