{
  "purpose": "Calculate approximate sunrise and sunset times based on geographic coordinates and date.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as lat, lon, at_date, and time_zone; method calls to get_sunrise_time, get_sunset_time, and internal calculations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in the code; calculations involve datetime objects and return timedelta or datetime objects.",
  "flows": "Input data (lat, lon, date) flows through sun position calculations, resulting in sunrise/sunset datetime outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated methods with warnings; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; straightforward calculations. No suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements astronomical calculations for sunrise and sunset times based on geographic coordinates and date, using standard mathematical formulas. No untrusted input handling vulnerabilities, no data exfiltration, nor network activity. The deprecation warnings are benign. No obfuscated code features are present. The methods rely on standard library functions and mathematical operations. Overall, the code appears focused on providing sunrise and sunset times without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of sun position calculations with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include backdoors, data leaks, or harmful actions. It seems safe for use in applications needing sunrise/sunset data.",
