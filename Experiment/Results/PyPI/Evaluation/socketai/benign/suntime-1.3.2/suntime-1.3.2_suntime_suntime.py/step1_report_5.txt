  "purpose": "Calculate approximate sunrise and sunset times for a given geographic location and date.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: lat, lon, at_date, time_zone. Methods receive datetime objects and timezone info.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is sent over network or stored maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input data (lat, lon, date, timezone) to calculations for sun times; no external data sinks or network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Usage of warnings and exceptions appears standard. No obfuscated or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to compute sunrise and sunset times based on geographic coordinates and date, following a mathematical approximation method. It handles invalid cases where the sun does not rise or set. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are observed. No suspicious code patterns or behavior are present. Usage of standard math functions, exception handling, and warnings is appropriate. No signs of malicious intent or malicious data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of sun time calculations with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs mathematical computations without interacting with external systems or handling sensitive data suspiciously.",
