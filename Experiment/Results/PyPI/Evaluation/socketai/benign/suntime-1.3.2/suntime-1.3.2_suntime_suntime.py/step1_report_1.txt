{
  "purpose": "Provides an approximate calculation of sunrise and sunset times based on geographic coordinates and date.",
  "sources": "Reads input from method parameters such as latitude, longitude, date, and timezone; also accesses system time for defaults.",
  "sinks": "Uses datetime and timedelta to compute times; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (location, date, timezone) flow into calculation functions, resulting in datetime objects representing sunrise/sunset times.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious data handling, no obfuscated code, and no malicious operations present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a mathematical model to estimate sunrise and sunset times based on celestial calculations. It relies solely on standard libraries (math, datetime, warnings) and standard parameters. The logic is contained within the class methods without external dependencies or network communication. No data leaks, no credential handling, and no malicious code patterns are evident. The warnings are deprecated notices for method usage and do not pose security concerns. The code does not perform any system modifications, data exfiltration, or backdoor activities.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign implementation of astronomical calculations for sunrise and sunset times. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. It is a standard, mathematical utility class with no malicious intent.",
