  "purpose": "Setup script for the suntime Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads package version, author, license from the suntime module; reads README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or user input processing present.",
  "flows": "Reads metadata variables from the suntime module and the README file; no flow of untrusted data to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior detected. The script performs standard package setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports package metadata from the suntime module and reads a README file for description. It then calls setup() with this data, following common Python packaging practices. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a normal setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
