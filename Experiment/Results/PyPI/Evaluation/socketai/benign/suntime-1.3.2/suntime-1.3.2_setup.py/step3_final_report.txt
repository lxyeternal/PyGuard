  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the suntime Python library, importing metadata and reading README for description.",
  "sources": "Imports from suntime module (__version__, __author__, __license__), reading README.md file from local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Importing metadata and reading static files; no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs typical packaging operations with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script that imports package metadata, reads a README file, and calls setup() with package info. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data processing. All indicators point to a benign, standard packaging script. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified based on the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe package setup file with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The provided reports are accurate, and their scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
