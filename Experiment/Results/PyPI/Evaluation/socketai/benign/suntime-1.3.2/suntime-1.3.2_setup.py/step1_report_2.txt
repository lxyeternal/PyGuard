  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'suntime' Python library, used to package and distribute the library.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports package metadata (__version__, __author__, __license__) from the suntime module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data being written or transmitted to external sources.",
  "flows": "Reads package metadata and README content; no flow from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code adheres to standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports version and author info from the package itself and reads a README file for long description, then calls setup() with package info and dependencies. All actions are typical for a setup.py script. No input/output from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, no network activity or data leaks. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues. It performs typical package configuration tasks without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
