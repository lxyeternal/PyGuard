  "purpose": "Setup script for the suntime Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, reading README.md file from filesystem.",
  "sinks": "None of the code involves untrusted data sinks or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file as static content; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: importing modules, reading a README file, and calling setup() with package metadata. The use of __version__, __author__, and __license__ from a package module is typical. File reading is from local filesystem only, with no network or external input involved. No dynamic code execution, no credential handling, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
