{
  "purpose": "This code imports classes from a local module and defines package metadata such as version, author, and license.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.suntime' that likely reads data or code from that module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data processing or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported module to the current namespace but does not involve untrusted sources or insecure data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The metadata appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a local module, which is a common pattern for modular Python packages. Metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __license__) are static strings that do not involve dynamic or sensitive data. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious functions, or data leaks. No external network activity, credential handling, or potentially dangerous code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard module initialization code with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports a class from a local module and sets package metadata.",
