{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes from a local module 'suntime' and defines package metadata such as version, author, and license.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing operations present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process untrusted data or define data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward package metadata and a standard import statement; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from a relative module 'suntime' and sets package metadata variables. There are no apparent data input sources, no sinks for untrusted data, and no operations that could be exploited. The import is from a local module, which is typical in Python packages. The metadata definitions are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical part of a Python package setup, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
