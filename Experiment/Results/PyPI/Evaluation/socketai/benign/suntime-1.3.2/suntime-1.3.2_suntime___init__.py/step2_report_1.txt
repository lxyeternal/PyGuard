  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their conclusions with the code provided.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .suntime import Sun, SunTimeException\n\n__version__ = '1.3.2'\n__author__ = 'Krzysztof Stopa'\n__license__ = 'LGPLv3'\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n\n- The code only performs a local import from `.suntime` and defines static metadata variables.\n- No dynamic code, no network activity, no data processing, no untrusted input handling.\n- No obfuscation, no signs of malicious code.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No issues are present in the code.** All reports correctly identify this as standard package setup code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1-5:\n- All describe the code as importing from a local module and setting metadata.\n- All conclude the code is benign, with no malicious activity or security risks.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n- Malware scores are 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \nYes. Since the code is straightforward and does not contain any suspicious or malicious elements, the scores of 0 for malware and 0.5 or higher for risk are justified as 0.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or inconsistencies:\n\n- The reports mention \"anomalies\" such as hardcoded credentials or suspicious code, but none are present.\n- The \"obfuscated\" scores are 0, which is correct.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n\n- Since the code is purely import and metadata, any higher scores would be unjustified.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is standard, benign package initialization code with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways consider the context; if the local module `.suntime` were malicious, that would be a separate concern, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior.",
