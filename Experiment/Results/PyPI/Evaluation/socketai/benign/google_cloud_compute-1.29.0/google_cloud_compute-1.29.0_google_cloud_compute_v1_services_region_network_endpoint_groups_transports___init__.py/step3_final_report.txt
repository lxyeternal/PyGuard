{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a registry for transport classes related to region network endpoint groups, registering a REST transport class for use in an SDK.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .rest), and the creation of the _transport_registry dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network connections, or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code initializes a registry dictionary and assigns a transport class to a key; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright year 2025, which is future-dated and likely a placeholder or typo, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, involving imports, a registry dictionary, and class registration. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or handling of untrusted input is present. The license date anomaly is noted but not a security concern. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low risk score (~0 or 0.1). The code is standard SDK boilerplate with no malicious or security-sensitive features. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The minor date anomaly does not impact security but could be corrected for clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK infrastructure code with no malicious intent or security issues. The existing assessments and scores are appropriate. The only minor concern is the future-dated license year, which does not pose a security risk.",
