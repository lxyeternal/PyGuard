  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the reports and the code.\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is a straightforward setup module that imports necessary classes, creates an ordered dictionary registry, registers a REST transport class under the 'rest' key, and defines what symbols are exported.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or handling of untrusted data.\n   - The license comment with a future date (2025) is unusual but not inherently malicious; it could be a placeholder or typo.\n\n2. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is boilerplate SDK setup code, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, and no handling of secrets.\n   - The license date inconsistency is noted but not considered a security issue.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - **Risk Score:** Most reports assign 0 or very low (0.1). Given the code's simplicity and lack of security-sensitive operations, a score of 0.0 or 0.1 is justified. The one report with 0.1 seems to consider the future-dated license as a minor anomaly, which is acceptable.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - The only unusual aspect is the license year 2025, which is inconsistent with current timelines. However, this is not a security concern but possibly a placeholder or typo.\n   - No claims are made about the code performing any malicious actions or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is benign, standard SDK infrastructure.\n   - No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a typical SDK setup module with no malicious intent or security issues. The existing reports and scores are appropriate. The only minor note is the future-dated license year, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, and the current scoring reflects that accurately. No changes needed.",
