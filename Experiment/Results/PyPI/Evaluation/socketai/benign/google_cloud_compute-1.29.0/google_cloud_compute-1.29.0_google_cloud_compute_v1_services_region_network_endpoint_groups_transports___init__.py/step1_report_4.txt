{
  "purpose": "This code defines and registers transport classes for RegionNetworkEndpointGroups, likely as part of a larger SDK or client library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base and .rest), class instantiations, and dictionary assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network calls, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import modules → define registry dictionary → assign transport class to registry → export symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard SDK boilerplate with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and local classes, sets up an ordered dictionary as a registry, adds a specific transport class under the 'rest' key, and defines the module's public API. There are no data inputs from untrusted sources, no network calls, no handling of secrets or credentials, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. It appears to be a typical part of a client SDK setup, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard SDK setup code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply registers transport classes for use in other parts of the SDK.",
