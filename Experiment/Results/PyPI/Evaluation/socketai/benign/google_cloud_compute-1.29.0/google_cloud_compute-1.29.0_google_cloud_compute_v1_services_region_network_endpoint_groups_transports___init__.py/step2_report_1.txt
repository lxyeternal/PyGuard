  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is boilerplate setup for registering transport classes in an SDK.\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code appears standard, with no signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The only unusual aspect is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date, but this is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Specific issues and scoring:\n\n**Malware score:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- No suspicious code, network activity, or data leaks are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**\n- All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n\n**Risk score:**\n- The reports give a risk score of 0 or 0.1, citing the code as boilerplate SDK setup with no security risks.\n- Given the nature of the code, which is simple class registration, the risk is minimal.\n- The only minor point is the future-dated copyright year, but this is not a security concern.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep the risk score at **0.0** for accuracy and consistency.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of my assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (standard boilerplate code with no security risks)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, standard SDK infrastructure, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the nature of the code.",
