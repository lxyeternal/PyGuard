  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a license header containing licensing and copyright information, with no executable code or logic.",
  "sources": "The comments and license text, which are static and do not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code contains only comments.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments related to licensing, with no executable statements, data processing, or network activity. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, which does not pose a security threat. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The confidence level is high (1.0), given the straightforward content. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present or implied. The scores are consistent with the content, and no further analysis suggests any risk or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a license header with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate, and the overall security posture is safe. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.",
