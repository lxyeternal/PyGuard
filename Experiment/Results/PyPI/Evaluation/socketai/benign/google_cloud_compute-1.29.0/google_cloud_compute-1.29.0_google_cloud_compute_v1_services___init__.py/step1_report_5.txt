  "flows": "No data flow or processing flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright date set to 2025, which is a future date; this is unusual but not inherently malicious. The rest of the code is purely a license comment block.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments that specify licensing and copyright information. There are no executable statements, data handling, or code constructs that could be malicious. The presence of a future copyright year is uncommon but not suspicious. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious behavior is detectable.",
