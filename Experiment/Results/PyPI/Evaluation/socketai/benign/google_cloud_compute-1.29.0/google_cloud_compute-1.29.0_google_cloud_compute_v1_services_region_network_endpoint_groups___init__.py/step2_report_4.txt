  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code is a minimal, standard module that imports a class and exports it via `__all__`.\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- Licensing comments are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.\n- The import is from a relative module, typical in package structures.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are noted.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code snippet itself is straightforward and benign.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- No issues found; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound, emphasizing the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- Given the analysis, the assigned scores seem appropriate.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score should be 0, reflecting no security concerns.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (benign, standard package code)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, harmless module setup with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep scores as they are: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n- No further action needed.",
