  "purpose": "This code appears to be a license and metadata header for a Python source file, indicating version and licensing information.",
  "sources": "The source is the license comments and the __version__ variable declaration.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is only metadata and comments.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is standard licensing boilerplate with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments, licensing information, and a version variable. There is no executable logic, no data input/output, and no dynamic behavior. The __version__ variable is a static string assignment. The entire code is straightforward and conforms to standard open-source licensing practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a licensing header and version indicator. There are no security concerns or malicious intent detected.",
