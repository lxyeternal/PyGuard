  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard license and version declaration, serving as metadata for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The license comments and the __version__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only metadata assignments.",
  "anomalies": "The license comments contain a future year (2025), which is unusual for current code but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains license information, copyright notice, and a version string. There are no executable functions, input handling, or network activity. The license comments do not perform any actions; they merely describe licensing terms. The version assignment is a standard practice for package versioning. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as metadata for a package or module. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
