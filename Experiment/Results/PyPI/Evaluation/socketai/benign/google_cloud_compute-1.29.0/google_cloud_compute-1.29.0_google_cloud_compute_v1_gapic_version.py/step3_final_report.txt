{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a license header and version identifier for a software module, containing only comments and a static version string.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it consists solely of comments and a variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist, as the code contains only static comments and a variable assignment with no dynamic or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025), which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely metadata: comments, licensing information, and a version string assignment. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. The future year is noted but does not indicate malicious intent. All signals point to a benign, standard header. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign license and version header with no malicious or security concerns. The only anomaly (future year) is non-malicious. The existing assessments and scores are appropriate and accurate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
