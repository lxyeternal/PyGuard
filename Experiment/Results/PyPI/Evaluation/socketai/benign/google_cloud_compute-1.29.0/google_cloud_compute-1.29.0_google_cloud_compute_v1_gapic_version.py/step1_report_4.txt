  "sinks": "No active code, data sinks are not present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code consists only of comments and a single variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains standard license headers and version info.",
  "analysis": "The file contains only comments and a single assignment to __version__, which is a common practice for package versioning. There are no functions, user inputs, external data reads, or dynamic code execution. The license and copyright comments do not execute or influence behavior. The __version__ assignment is static and does not pose security risks. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata with no executable or suspicious content. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
