  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Errors:** Reports \"Empty response\" with no content.  \n- **Assessment:** No meaningful data or code to evaluate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious code; insufficient data.  \n- **Risk score:** N/A, but default to 0.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Errors:** Same as report 1, \"Empty response.\"  \n- **Assessment:** No code to analyze.  \n- **Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious behavior; no data.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & analysis:** Clearly states the code is a static module that imports and re-exports many classes and constants related to Google Cloud Compute V1 API.  \n- **Sources & sinks:** Only import/export, no dynamic or untrusted data handling.  \n- **Anomalies:** The only oddity is the copyright year \"2025\" and license date, which is inconsistent but benign—likely a placeholder or pre-release marker.  \n- **Malware & obfuscation:** None detected.  \n- **Conclusion:** This is a well-structured, auto-generated SDK or API wrapper, with no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- **Score justification:** Given the absence of executable logic, data flow, or suspicious patterns, malware score is 0. The obfuscated score is 0. As a static SDK module, the overall security risk is negligible.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & sources:** Similar to report 3, it describes a static module aggregating imports from Google Cloud SDK components.  \n- **Analysis:** No runtime logic, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns. The large number of imports and the __all__ list are typical for SDK packages.  \n- **Anomalies:** The future-dated copyright (2025) is unusual but not malicious—possibly a placeholder.  \n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The risk remains very low.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & sources:** Same as above, a static aggregation of SDK classes and types.  \n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, no data flow, no obfuscation.  \n- **Anomalies:** The future year \"2025\" in copyright.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malware, malicious code, or security risk detected.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is a static, auto-generated SDK module with no executable logic or data flow.  \n- **Malware & obfuscation:** All reports indicate zero malware, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns.  \n- **Anomalies:** The only anomaly is the future year \"2025\" in comments, which is benign and likely a placeholder or pre-release marker.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 for all reports.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 for all reports.  \n  - **Risk:** Given the static, SDK-like nature, overall risk is extremely low, score ~0.1 or less.  \n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, primarily due to placeholder year)  \n\nThis code is a legitimate, auto-generated SDK module with no malicious intent or security issues.",
