  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The slight security risk score of 0.1 reflects the potential for tampering with the version file, but this is a standard concern rather than an active vulnerability. Malware and obfuscated scores are zero, indicating no malicious or obfuscated code. The overall security risk is minimal, and the script is safe for use."
