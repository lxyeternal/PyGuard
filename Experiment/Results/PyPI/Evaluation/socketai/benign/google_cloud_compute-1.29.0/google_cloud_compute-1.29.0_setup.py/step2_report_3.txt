  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Standard setup script, reads version from a local file, no dynamic code execution.  \n- Sources & Sinks: File I/O only, no network or untrusted data.  \n- Flows & Anomalies: No suspicious operations; regex used for version parsing is standard.  \n- Analysis & Conclusion: The code is benign, typical for package setup, with no malware or malicious intent.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose & Sources: Similar to Report 1, reads version and README.  \n- Sinks & Flows: No dangerous operations, no network activity.  \n- Anomalies & Analysis: Standard package setup, no suspicious patterns.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, benign script.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose & Sources: Reads version info and README, package discovery.  \n- Sinks & Flows: No unsafe data handling, no network activity.  \n- Anomalies & Analysis: Standard procedures, regex for version is common.  \n- Conclusion: Typical setup script, no malicious behavior.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose & Sources: Similar pattern, reads version, README, dependencies.  \n- Sinks & Flows: No untrusted data or network activity.  \n- Anomalies & Analysis: Standard, straightforward setup.  \n- Noted a slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), likely due to the reliance on reading version info from a file, which could be tampered with if the file is malicious.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable given the context.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose & Sources: Standard package setup, no external data fetching.  \n- Sinks & Flows: No untrusted data, no network activity.  \n- Anomalies & Analysis: Typical setup pattern, no suspicious code.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Risk Scores:** The only slight variation is in Report 4, which assigns a small security risk (0.1) due to potential tampering with version file reading, which is a reasonable concern but not an active vulnerability.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the overall benign nature, I would assign a risk score of **0.05** (very low), acknowledging that reading version info from a local file could, in theory, be tampered with, but this is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n\n**Overall, the package setup code appears safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.**",
