  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads version info from a local file, reads README content, discovers packages, and configures dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations for reading version info and README, package discovery via setuptools.find_namespace_packages()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no network activity, no external data flows",
  "flows": "Reading version info from local file, reading README, package discovery, invoking setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to extract version from a file, reliance on local files which could be tampered with, redundant assignment of package_root",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks: reading version info with regex, reading README for long description, discovering packages, and configuring dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input beyond local file reads. The regex-based version extraction is standard but could be fragile if the file format changes. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The dependencies are version-restricted, reducing supply chain risk. The minor concern about version file tampering is acknowledged but is a common pattern in setup scripts. Overall, the script is benign, straightforward, and aligns with best practices for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The slight security risk score of 0.1 reflects the potential for tampering with the version file, but this is a standard concern rather than an active vulnerability. Malware and obfuscated scores are zero, indicating no malicious or obfuscated code. The overall security risk is minimal, and the script is safe for use.",
