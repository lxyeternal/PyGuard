  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a legitimate, well-structured Python client for the Gravatar API, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The minor security concerns are typical for such libraries and do not indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.15) are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis."
