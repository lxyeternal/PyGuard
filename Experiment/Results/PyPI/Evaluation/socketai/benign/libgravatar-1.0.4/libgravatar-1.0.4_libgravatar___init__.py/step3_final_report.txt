  "purpose": "Provides a Python interface to the Gravatar API for generating avatar URLs and retrieving profile data, supporting both unauthenticated and authenticated (XML-RPC) methods.",
  "sources": "Email input for hashing, URL parameters for image and profile requests, optional API key and password for authenticated API calls.",
  "sinks": "URL construction for avatar images and profile data, network requests to Gravatar endpoints, print statements for error reporting.",
  "flows": "Email input -> md5 hash -> URL generation; API credentials + email hash -> API call -> response handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print() for error reporting instead of logging; no hardcoded credentials; straightforward URL validation; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a Gravatar client, with URL generation based on email hashes, input validation for image size and default URLs, and optional API credentials for XML-RPC. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. Error handling via print() is suboptimal but not malicious. The code uses well-known libraries and practices, with no obfuscation or hidden payloads. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to standard API credential handling and input validation. The malware score is zero, indicating no malicious intent. The obfuscation score is zero, as the code is clear and readable. The overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the reports and the code's purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a legitimate, well-structured Python client for the Gravatar API, with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The minor security concerns are typical for such libraries and do not indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.15) are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
