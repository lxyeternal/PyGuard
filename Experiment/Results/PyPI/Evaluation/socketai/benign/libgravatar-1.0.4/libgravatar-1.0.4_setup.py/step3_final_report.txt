  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the 'libgravatar' Python library, defining metadata and reading a README file.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long_description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network operations",
  "flows": "Reading local file -> passing static data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code, no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads a local README file and invokes setuptools.setup() with static, hardcoded metadata. It does not process untrusted input, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. All URLs and contact info are public and relevant. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the benign and standard nature of the code. The confidence level is 1, given the static and straightforward analysis. No logical flaws or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided setup.py is a standard, benign package configuration script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as such, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
