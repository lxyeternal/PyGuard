{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'libgravatar' Python package, providing package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long_description, static string definitions for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None. The script does not process untrusted input or perform dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "N/A. No data flows from sources to sinks, as the script only reads a file and defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code is straightforward and standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools, reads a README file, and calls setup() with static package metadata. All operations are standard for packaging; no untrusted input handling or dangerous functions are used. The package metadata appears typical and does not contain embedded secrets or malicious instructions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup.py script for Python packaging with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not process untrusted data or include any harmful instructions.",
