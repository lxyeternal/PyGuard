  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'libgravatar', including metadata and package details.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long_description; static strings for package metadata and URLs.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks or external data outputs within this script.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.rst' and assigning static strings to setup parameters; no untrusted data flow or external data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup.py content with no unusual code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and reads a local README file, then invokes 'setup()' with static metadata parameters. All data are hardcoded or read from a trusted local file. There are no code injections, dynamic code execution, or external data flows. URLs and emails are static and intended for project hosting and documentation. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It contains static metadata and file reading operations typical for Python package configuration.",
