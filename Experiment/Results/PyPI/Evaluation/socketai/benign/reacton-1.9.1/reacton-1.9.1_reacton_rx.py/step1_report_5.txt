{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom hook to subscribe to an observable and maintain its latest value in state.",
  "sources": "The observable parameter, which provides data updates.",
  "sinks": "The subscribe method's on_next callback which updates state; print statement for errors.",
  "flows": "Observable emits data -> on_next callback updates state via set_value.",
  "anomalies": "Simple error handling with print; no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscation or backdoors. No code injection or data leakage apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports reactive extensions, defines a hook that manages observable subscription and state updates. It subscribes to the observable, updating local state on new data. Error handling is minimal, with errors printed to stdout. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are detected. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors observed. The code appears straightforward and aligned with expected patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for managing observable subscriptions in a React-like environment. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The implementation is simple, with no suspicious anomalies or malicious intent.",
