  "conclusion": "The code is a standard reactive hook managing observable subscriptions with minor code quality issues (typos, error handling). No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified. The malware score is 0, and obfuscation score is 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code."
