  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex code generation utility with inherent risks due to dynamic execution via exec(). There is no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or sabotage. The main concern is executing untrusted code, which should be mitigated with validation or sandboxing in production. The current assessment assigns a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a moderate security risk (~0.4)."
