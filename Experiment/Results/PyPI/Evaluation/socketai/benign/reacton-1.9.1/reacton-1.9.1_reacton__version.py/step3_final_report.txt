  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable for package metadata.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from source to sink as there are no inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward version assignment with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It contains no inputs, outputs, network activity, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
