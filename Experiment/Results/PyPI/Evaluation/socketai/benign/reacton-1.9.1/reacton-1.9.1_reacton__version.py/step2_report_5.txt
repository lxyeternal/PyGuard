  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and common in Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The assessments of benignity and security are justified based on the code content.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - obfuscated: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - malware: 0 (no malware)\n     - securityRisk: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - All scores are 0, which is justified.\n   - No evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities justifies any higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign malware: 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - No malicious behavior is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the identical and consistent findings, I concur with the provided scores. The code is purely a version string assignment with no security implications.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Score |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| Malware         | 0      |\n| Obfuscated      | 0      |\n| Security Risk   | 0      |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is entirely benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.",
