  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns a string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, network activity, or any operations beyond this assignment.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for package versioning.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior and Obfuscation:**\n   - All reports indicate no obfuscation (`obfuscated: 0`) and no malware (`malware: 0`).\n   - The code is not suspicious or malicious in any way; it’s standard metadata.\n\n3. **Risk Assessment:**\n   - The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with benign code.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), reflecting strong agreement among reports.\n\n4. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws:**\n   - No flaws or mistakes are apparent in the reasoning; all reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No assumptions are made that could be challenged, as the code is minimal and clear.\n\n5. **Score Justification:**\n   - Since the code is just a version string assignment, the malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll evidence points to this being a standard, harmless version declaration snippet with no security concerns.",
