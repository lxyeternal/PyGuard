  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the original code:\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\n__version__ = \"1.9.1\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- All reports describe a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No inputs, outputs, data flows, or external interactions are present.\n- The code is straightforward and typical for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- All state that the code only assigns a string to `__version__`.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 1.0), which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n**Errors or flaws in the reports:**\n- None detected. All reports are consistent and accurate regarding the benign nature of this code fragment.\n\n**Scores:**\n- `malware`: 0 in all reports, which is correct.\n- `obfuscated`: 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- `securityRisk`: 0, since no vulnerabilities or suspicious activity are present.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.\n- The malware score of 0 across reports is justified.\n\n**Potential assumptions or claims:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a simple version assignment.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious intent are made; the analysis is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type       | Justification                                                  |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0 — No malicious behavior or hidden payloads.                   |\n| Obfuscated       | 0 — Clear, straightforward assignment without obfuscation.     |\n| Risk             | 0 — No security risk or vulnerabilities present.               |\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a standard version declaration.\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code fragment is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The current assessments are appropriate and justified.",
