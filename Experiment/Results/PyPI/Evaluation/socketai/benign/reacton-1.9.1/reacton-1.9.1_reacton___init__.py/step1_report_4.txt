{
  "purpose": "The code defines the public interface and imports for a Python package that provides ipywidgets-like functionality, including various hooks and components for interactive widgets.",
  "sources": "The code imports internal version info from ._version and various functions/classes from .core.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage are present. No network or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports and re-exports symbols; there are no source-to-sink data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior observed. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info and various functions from a local core module. It then defines __all__ to specify the public API of the package. There are no evident malicious payloads, network operations, or suspicious code behaviors. The code appears to serve as a module initializer, providing organized access to package features.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package initialization module for a Python library, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It simply imports and exposes functions and classes for external use.",
