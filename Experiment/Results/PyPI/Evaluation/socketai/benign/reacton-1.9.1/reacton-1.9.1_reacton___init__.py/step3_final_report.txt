{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization module, importing version info and core components, then exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from _version and core modules, no external data or input handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, no external network or file operations, no data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import statements lead to setting __version__ and __all__, with no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code; straightforward structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package __init__.py-like setup, importing version info and core functions, then defining __all__. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign, organizational nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate; the slight elevation in report 5's security risk score to 0.1 is unwarranted and should be adjusted to 0.",
