{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for a React-like widget framework in Python, testing rendering, searching, and waiting mechanisms for widgets and their properties.",
  "sources": "Widget property definitions, component functions, threading and sleep calls for async simulation, react.render outputs.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on widget properties, internal widget tree traversal; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Widget creation and rendering lead to search and assertion functions; threading and sleep simulate asynchronous updates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected. Use of threading and sleep is standard for async testing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard widget rendering and querying tests. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code is present. Threading and sleep are used solely for simulating asynchronous behavior in tests, which is common practice. No external data leaks or system modifications are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard set of unit tests for a React-like widget framework. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security threats are present. The low risk scores are justified by the testing context, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero.",
