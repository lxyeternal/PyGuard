  "purpose": "Build hooks for Python packaging, delegating core build tasks to internal classes and managing environment-based configuration.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (WHEY_TRACEBACK, WHEY_VERBOSE), external modules (consolekit, domdf_python_tools, whey.foreman, whey.utils), internal classes (Foreman, WheelBuilder).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code delegates to internal classes without executing untrusted code or network activity.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence traceback and verbosity settings; functions invoke external build classes which perform the actual packaging.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward, with standard practices and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a typical Python build utility, using environment variables for configuration, importing reputable modules, and delegating core tasks to internal classes. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The environment variables are used for debugging and verbosity, which is standard. External modules are assumed reputable. The structure and logic are clear and standard for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign build utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2—are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
