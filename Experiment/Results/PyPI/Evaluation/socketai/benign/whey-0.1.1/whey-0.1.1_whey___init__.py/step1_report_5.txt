{
  "purpose": "This script provides functions for building Python distribution packages, including wheels and source distributions, using PEP 517 hooks. It orchestrates build processes via imported components.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables ('WHEY_TRACEBACK', 'WHEY_VERBOSE'), and external modules (consolekit.tracebacks, domdf_python_tools.paths, whey.foreman, whey.utils, whey.builder).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the use of environment variables to control traceback display and verbosity, and dynamic imports for build processes, but no direct data sinks or external data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables to flags controlling traceback and verbosity settings, then into build functions that invoke external modules (Foreman, WheelBuilder) for package creation. No untrusted data is directly used in insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected. Usage of environment variables for control flow is standard; no unusual or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard build hooks for Python packaging, importing external modules to perform build tasks. It uses environment variables to control traceback and verbosity, which is typical. No suspicious code paths, external network connections, or malicious operations are present. The functions simply delegate to external modules for building packages. All imported modules are from reputable sources or internal packages, with no indication of malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate build utility code for Python packaging, with no malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks identified. It relies on external modules to perform actual build tasks, and the code structure is typical for such scripts.",
