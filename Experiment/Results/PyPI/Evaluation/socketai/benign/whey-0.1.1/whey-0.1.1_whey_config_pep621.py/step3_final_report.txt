  "purpose": "Parser for :pep:`621` metadata from 'pyproject.toml', validating required fields and handling defaults.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from a dictionary, accesses 'dynamic', 'name', 'version', and other fields.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data flows through validation and parsing functions within the code.",
  "flows": "Source: configuration dictionary -> validation logic -> parsed_config dictionary -> return cast.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs; validation raises errors on invalid configs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation for 'pyproject.toml' metadata, raising exceptions for missing or unsupported fields. It manages defaults and dynamic fields securely, with no external system calls, network activity, or code execution. The logic is straightforward, with generic error messages, and relies on third-party libraries for parsing. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is well-structured and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured configuration parser for PEP 621 metadata. It performs validation without any malicious intent or security issues. No suspicious activity or obfuscation is detected.",
