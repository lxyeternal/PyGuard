  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility for managing file inclusion/exclusion patterns in packaging workflows. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
