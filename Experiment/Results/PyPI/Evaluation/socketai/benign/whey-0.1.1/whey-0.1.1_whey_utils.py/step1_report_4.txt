{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for handling tracebacks, parsing custom builders, and printing builder information within a build system or CLI application.",
  "sources": "Imports external libraries (`click`, `domdf_python_tools`, `pyproject_parser`, `whey` modules) and reads data from function parameters, class initializations, and environment (via imported modules).",
  "sinks": "Uses `click.echo()` for output; reads builder names from user input (via function arguments) and entry point configurations.",
  "flows": "Input builder names -> `parse_custom_builders()` checks entry points -> builder data stored in `custom_builders` -> `print_builder_names()` outputs builder info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. The code relies on standard Python patterns and external libraries. No suspicious dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines utility classes and functions for handling traceback configurations, parsing builder definitions, and printing build information. It imports several external libraries, including `click` for CLI output, and relies on entry points to load builder classes. The functions operate purely on provided parameters and imported data, with no indication of malicious activity. There are no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or code that could execute arbitrary or harmful actions. The code's logic appears standard for a CLI utility module in a build system.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for a build system, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard input validation, class loading via entry points, and CLI output, all consistent with normal usage. No malicious intent or suspicious code segments are present.",
