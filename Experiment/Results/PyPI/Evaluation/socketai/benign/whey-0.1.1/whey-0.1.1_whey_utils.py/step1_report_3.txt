{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for handling traceback, parsing custom builders, and printing builder names in a Python project related to whey build system.",
  "sources": "Input sources include the 'builders' argument in 'parse_custom_builders' and 'opts' in 'print_builder_names'; also, environment data could influence the 'foreman' configuration and entry points.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include 'click.echo' for output, and 'cast' for type conversions. No data leakage or malicious sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'builders' parameter through validation and casting into 'custom_builders', then to output via 'click.echo'. 'opts' dict influences which builders are printed, with 'foreman' providing configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code uses standard library and third-party modules in typical ways.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes and functions for handling build configurations and output formatting. It validates builder names against entry points, loads classes via 'load()', and displays configuration info. No unsafe or malicious operations are present; all functions perform standard validation, casting, and printing tasks without external data manipulation or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing standard configuration handling and output. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are detected. It uses well-understood third-party libraries appropriately.",
