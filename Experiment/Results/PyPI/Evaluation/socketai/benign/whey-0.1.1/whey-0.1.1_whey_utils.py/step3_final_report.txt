  "purpose": "Utility functions for traceback handling, parsing custom build configurations, and printing build information in a build system.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line options, external entry points via 'get_entry_points()', and data from 'foreman.config'.",
  "sinks": "Output via 'click.echo' for displaying build info and error messages; plugin loading via 'load()' from entry points.",
  "flows": "Input options and entry point data flow into functions that validate and load plugins, then output build configuration details.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'load()' on entry points could potentially load malicious plugins if registered maliciously, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module that handles plugin validation, configuration parsing, and output formatting. It employs standard practices such as type casting, plugin entry point loading, and command-line interaction. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The only notable point is reliance on external plugins via 'load()', which could be exploited if malicious plugins are registered, but this is a common extensibility pattern and not inherently malicious. The code is well-structured, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe and benign, serving as a utility component in a build system. The potential security concern lies in the plugin loading mechanism, which could be exploited if malicious plugins are registered, but this is outside the code's scope and is a known risk in plugin architectures. Overall, the code does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation, and the security risk is minimal and justified.",
