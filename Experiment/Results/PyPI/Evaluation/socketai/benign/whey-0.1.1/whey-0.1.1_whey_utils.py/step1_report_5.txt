{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for handling traceback customization, builder parsing, and printing builder information within a build system.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'click', 'domdf_python_tools.words', 'pyproject_parser.cli', and local modules; function parameters such as 'builders', 'foreman', and 'opts'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is explicitly processed into sensitive operations or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input 'builders' list flows into 'parse_custom_builders' to load entry points; 'opts' keys flow into 'print_builder_names' to access configuration; data from 'foreman.config' is used for printing builder info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious or obfuscated code. Use of 'cast' for type safety is standard. No network, file, or environment variable manipulation is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles parsing of user-supplied builder names, validating them against entry points, and printing build information. All external data sources are controlled, and no dynamic code execution or system commands beyond standard 'click' output are used. No suspicious patterns, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions to facilitate build configuration and reporting without processing untrusted data into sensitive operations.",
