{
  "purpose": "Utility module providing custom traceback handling, builder parsing, and printing functions for a build system.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (typing), third-party libraries (click, domdf_python_tools, pyproject_parser), and local modules (whey.*).",
  "sinks": "Uses click.echo for output, which could potentially be exploited if output is manipulated, but generally safe for standard output.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like builders are parsed and validated against entry points; output is printed via click.echo.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of cast is standard, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution, no external data exfiltration or network communication.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes and functions for handling build configuration. It performs validation of builder names against entry points, raising exceptions on invalid input. The printing function outputs build info using click.echo, which is a standard pattern. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security vulnerabilities. No dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no external network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for build process management, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears well-structured and safe for use.",
