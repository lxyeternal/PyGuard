{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the packaging process for a Python project named 'whey'.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'requirements.txt' file for dependencies, importing modules, appending current directory to sys.path, importing '__pkginfo__'.",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects; no untrusted data execution or external connections.",
  "flows": "Reading 'requirements.txt' -> setup() configuration; importing '__pkginfo__' (likely static data); deleting 'whey.egg-info' directory.",
  "anomalies": "The import of '__pkginfo__' with a wildcard, which could potentially hide malicious code or secrets if the module contains such, but this alone is common in setup scripts; no explicit malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a setup configuration for packaging a Python module. It reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and imports a package-specific info module. The removal of the 'whey.egg-info' directory is a standard cleanup step. There are no signs of malicious behaviors such as network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated code. The wildcard import of '__pkginfo__' could be a concern if that module contains malicious code, but it is typical in package configuration files and cannot be judged malicious solely on this code. Overall, the code appears safe and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The only minor concern is the wildcard import, which is common but should be verified in the context of the '__pkginfo__' module. Overall, it appears safe.",
