  "purpose": "Set up configuration for building and installing a Python package named 'whey'.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements.txt for dependencies, importing __pkginfo__, and accessing sys.path.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input directly; setup configuration is standard.",
  "flows": "Reads dependencies from requirements.txt, then proceeds to call setup() with package info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from __pkginfo__ import *' could introduce risks if __pkginfo__ contains malicious code, but as a standard package metadata file, it's likely safe; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures, including reading dependencies and invoking setuptools.setup. The only potential concern is the wildcard import from __pkginfo__, which could potentially contain malicious code if not controlled, but this is a common pattern for managing package metadata. The code does not execute untrusted data or perform network operations. The removal of 'whey.egg-info' directory is standard cleanup. Overall, the code appears straightforward, with no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with minimal risk. The only slight concern is the wildcard import from __pkginfo__, which should be verified for safety, but this is common in package setup scripts. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
