  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'whey', configuring dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt'; imports '__pkginfo__' module; appends current directory to sys.path.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file system malicious activity; no data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Reads dependencies -> imports '__pkginfo__' -> setup() call -> cleanup of egg-info directory.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from '__pkginfo__' and appending '.' to sys.path are unusual but common in setup scripts; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup tasks with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The only minor concern is the wildcard import from a local module, which should be verified for safety but is standard practice. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code execution is detected. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward setup routine with negligible security risks. No malware or obfuscation detected. The minor concern over the import pattern is typical and unlikely to be malicious if the module is trusted.",
