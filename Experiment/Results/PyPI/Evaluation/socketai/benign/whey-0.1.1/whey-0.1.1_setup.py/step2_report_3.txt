  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the script is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- The only recurring concern is the wildcard import of `__pkginfo__`, which could theoretically hide malicious code if the module is compromised. However, in typical package setup scripts, this pattern is common and usually safe if the module is trusted.\n- No reports mention any network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n- The removal of the `whey.egg-info` directory is standard cleanup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in code:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior.\n- The only \"potential\" issue is the use of `from __pkginfo__ import *`, which could hide malicious code if `__pkginfo__` is compromised. But this is a common pattern in setup scripts, assuming the module is trusted.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No actual errors or flaws are evident.\n- The use of `sys.path.append('.')` is somewhat unusual but not malicious.\n- The wildcard import could be considered a bad practice in general, but in this context, it's a common pattern for package metadata.\n\n### Score assessments:\n\n#### Malware score:\n- All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n- **No change needed.**\n\n#### Obfuscated score:\n- All reports assign `0`. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **No change needed.**\n\n#### Security risk score:\n- Reports range from 0.1 to 0.2, indicating very low risk.\n- Given the lack of malicious behavior, this is reasonable.\n- The only minor concern is the wildcard import, but it's common and unlikely to be malicious.\n- **I agree with the scores; no change needed.**\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The reports correctly identify that the main \"risk\" is the wildcard import, which should be verified in the actual `__pkginfo__` module.\n- Since the code does not execute untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated/malicious code, the overall risk remains very low.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Score |\n|------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware          | 0               |\n| Obfuscated       | 0               |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1 to 0.2      |\n\n**My judgment:**  \n- The malware score remains **0**.  \n- The obfuscated score remains **0**.  \n- The security risk score could be slightly increased to **0.2** due to the wildcard import, but given the context, **0.1** is sufficient.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign setup script.\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- The only minor concern is the wildcard import from `__pkginfo__`, which is typical in such scripts but should be verified for safety.\n- Overall, the code is low risk, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep the scores as they are or slightly adjust the security risk to 0.2 for caution.  \n- No changes to malware or obfuscated scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Critical note:**  \nAlways verify the contents of `__pkginfo__` in production environments to ensure it doesn't contain malicious code, especially if the module is untrusted or sourced externally.",
