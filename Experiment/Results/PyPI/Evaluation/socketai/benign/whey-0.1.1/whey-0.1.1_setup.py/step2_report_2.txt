  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Standard Python setup script.\n- Reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt'.\n- Imports package metadata from '__pkginfo__' using a wildcard import.\n- Appends current directory to sys.path.\n- Calls setup() with package info.\n- Removes 'whey.egg-info' directory after setup.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup for 'whey'.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; the only concern is the wildcard import from '__pkginfo__', which could be risky if the module is malicious, but typically it's a controlled local module.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity detected. The score of 0 for malware aligns with the analysis. The security risk is low, justified by the potential for malicious code in '__pkginfo__' if compromised.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Similar reasoning; no malicious behavior, just standard setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the previous, reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Similar setup.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity; routine package setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Very straightforward, appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Standard setup.\n- **Analysis:** Same reasoning; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable, consistent with previous reports.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same as others.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; the wildcard import from '__pkginfo__' is typical but could be risky if the module is compromised. The appending of '.' to sys.path is common in local setup scripts.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or obfuscated payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above 0.1 in some reports due to the wildcard import from '__pkginfo__'. While common, it could be risky if the module is malicious, but there's no evidence of that here.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — the only minor concern is the wildcard import, which is typical but could be exploited if the module is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and justified.\n- The scores are reasonable given the evidence.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or behavior.\n- The only minor concern is the use of wildcard import from a local module, which is standard but should be verified in a security-critical context.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign setup script with negligible security risk.",
