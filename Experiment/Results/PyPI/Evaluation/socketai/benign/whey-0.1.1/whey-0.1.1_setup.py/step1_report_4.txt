  "purpose": "Setup script for building and installing a Python package named 'whey'.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies; importing package metadata from '__pkginfo__'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data is used in a way that affects security.",
  "flows": "Reading dependencies from 'requirements.txt' -> used in 'install_requires' during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Importing '__pkginfo__' with a wildcard import; the use of 'sys.path.append('.')' is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup tasks: importing modules, reading requirements, and calling 'setup()'. The import of '__pkginfo__' with a wildcard could be suspicious if '__pkginfo__' is untrusted or malicious, but it appears to be a local module. The code reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' without processing or executing untrusted code. The script deletes 'whey.egg-info' directory after setup, which is a common cleanup step. There are no network operations, code injections, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard package setup script with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The only minor concern is the wildcard import and appending current directory to 'sys.path', but these are typical in setup scripts and do not suggest malicious activity.",
