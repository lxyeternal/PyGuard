{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'whey' by reading dependencies from a requirements file and configuring package metadata for setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the requirements.txt file for dependencies; importing package info from __pkginfo__",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is used in a way that could cause harm or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reading requirements.txt content into install_requires; importing package info; executing setup() with package metadata; deleting egg-info directory",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard setup script structure. The only minor note is appending '.' to sys.path, which is common in local package setups.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, importing standard libraries and setuptools, reading dependencies from a file, and configuring package installation. It does not contain any code that executes untrusted input, performs network operations, or contains obfuscated or malicious code. The use of '__pkginfo__' and reading requirements is standard, and the removal of 'whey.egg-info' directory is routine post-build cleanup. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares a package for distribution.",
