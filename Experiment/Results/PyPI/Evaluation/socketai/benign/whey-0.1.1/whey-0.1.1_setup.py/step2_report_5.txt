  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The script is a standard Python setup script that:\n  - Reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt'.\n  - Imports package metadata from '__pkginfo__' via a wildcard import.\n  - Appends the current directory to sys.path.\n  - Calls setuptools.setup() with the gathered info.\n  - Cleans up the 'whey.egg-info' directory after setup.\n\n**Security considerations:**\n- The code performs typical package setup tasks.\n- The use of 'from __pkginfo__ import *' could be a minor concern if '__pkginfo__' contains malicious code, but in standard practice, this is a controlled local module.\n- Appending '.' to sys.path is common in local setup scripts.\n- No untrusted data processing, network activity, or code obfuscation is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- Deletion of egg-info directory is routine cleanup.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Key point: Wildcard import from '__pkginfo__' is a slight concern but likely safe.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious behavior detected; standard setup script.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- Key point: Same as above; no suspicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Safe, routine code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- Key point: No anomalies; straightforward setup script.\n- **Verdict:** No risks identified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Key point: Wildcard import and sys.path modification are typical but minor concerns.\n- **Verdict:** No malicious behavior; standard setup.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- Key point: Same as above; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Safe, typical setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and scoring justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The wildcard import from '__pkginfo__' is a potential concern but not inherently malicious, especially if '__pkginfo__' is a trusted local module. No evidence of malware or malicious code execution exists.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the overall benign nature, the risk scores are low (0.1–0.2). The only minor concern is the wildcard import and sys.path modification, but these are common in setup scripts and do not pose significant security risks.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided reports and code analysis:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, mainly due to import style, but not significant)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the consensus across reports, with no evidence to suggest any security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign Python package setup script. The wildcard import from '__pkginfo__' and sys.path modification are typical in such scripts and do not indicate malicious intent. No vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation are present. The low risk score is appropriate, and the overall security posture is sound.",
