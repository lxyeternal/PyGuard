{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package named 'whey' by reading dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and configuring package metadata for building a wheel distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'requirements.txt' file and the '__pkginfo__' module.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data by removing the 'whey.egg-info' directory with shutil.rmtree.",
  "flows": "The script reads 'requirements.txt' to get dependencies, then uses setup() to configure package info, and finally deletes the egg-info directory.",
  "anomalies": "The import of '__pkginfo__' with a wildcard import could potentially conceal imported objects, but is not inherently malicious. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup operations, including reading dependencies, configuring setup parameters, and cleaning up build artifacts. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The only minor concern is the wildcard import from '__pkginfo__', which could hide unintended code but is common in package setup scripts. The script appears to be straightforward and intended for packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads dependencies, sets up package info, and cleans build artifacts. No malicious or harmful behavior is detected.",
