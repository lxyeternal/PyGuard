  "purpose": "A command-line interface for building Python project distributions such as wheels, sdist, and binaries.",
  "sources": "Input from command-line arguments, environment variables, and project path.",
  "sinks": "Build methods within the Foreman class, print statements, sys.exit, and click.echo.",
  "flows": "User inputs/arguments → functions like parse_custom_builders, main execution flow → build methods or sys.exit.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code relies on external build functions and libraries, but nothing indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily orchestrates project building using external libraries. It accepts user inputs via command-line options and arguments, which are passed to various build functions within the Foreman class. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code uses standard patterns for CLI tools, including tracebacks handling and verbose output. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected. All dependencies and imported modules appear standard for a build tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI wrapper around build functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply manages build processes based on user input and external libraries, which are not suspicious.",
