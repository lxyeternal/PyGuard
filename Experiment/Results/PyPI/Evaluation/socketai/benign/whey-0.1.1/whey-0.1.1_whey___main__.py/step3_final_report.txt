{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for building Python distributions such as wheels, sdist, and binaries, orchestrating build processes via external modules.",
  "sources": "CLI arguments, environment variables, imported modules (e.g., whey, whey.foreman, whey.utils).",
  "sinks": "External build functions (`build_wheel`, `build_sdist`, `build_binary`, custom builders) which may execute system commands or scripts.",
  "flows": "CLI inputs and environment variables flow into the main function, which configures and calls build methods; external modules handle actual build execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected. The code is straightforward and delegates core functionality to external modules.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard CLI wrapper for build orchestration, relying on external modules for execution. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The build functions could execute arbitrary commands if maliciously modified, but as provided, there is no evidence of malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, mainly due to delegation to external modules, which is typical for build tools. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting very low inherent risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI for building Python packages. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
