  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the script as a CLI for building Python distributions, matching the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Mentions build methods and environment variables; consistent.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The code only orchestrates build commands.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states no malicious activity; confidence 1 is justified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (low risk).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The low security risk score is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate, describing the CLI and input sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identifies potential execution points in build functions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard build wrapper.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states no malicious intent; confidence 0.9.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid and consistent. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes build method calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious behavior; confidence 0.9.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate assessment; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Mentions build method invocation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard CLI orchestration.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity; confidence 0.9.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly describes the build process.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code; delegation to external modules is typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity; confidence 0.9.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—it's a CLI orchestrator for build processes, with no embedded malicious code or network activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varies between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting minimal security concern—mainly the potential for external build commands to be misused if the external modules are compromised, but no evidence of such here.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code or behavior.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk:** 0.1 — very low, considering the script is a build orchestrator, but with some minimal inherent risk if external modules are compromised.\n\n**Note:** The scores in the reports are consistent with the code and the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard CLI wrapper for project building, with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. The scores are justified and align with the analysis.",
