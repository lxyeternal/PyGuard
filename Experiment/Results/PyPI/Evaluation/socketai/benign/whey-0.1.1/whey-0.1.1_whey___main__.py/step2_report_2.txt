  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the script is a CLI wrapper around the whey build system.\n- No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is detected.\n- The code delegates core build actions to external modules/classes, which could, in theory, execute system commands, but this is standard in build tools.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), which aligns with the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code appears to be a standard CLI for build automation, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or network activity.\n- The build functions (`build_wheel`, `build_sdist`, `build_binary`, custom builders) could execute external commands, but this is typical for build tools and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The report mentions that build functions could execute arbitrary commands if maliciously modified, but as provided, there's no evidence of such modification.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, risk=0.1–0.2) seem reasonable given the code.\n\n### Scores review:\n- Malware score: 0 is appropriate; no malicious code present.\n- Obfuscated: 0, correct.\n- Security risk: Very low, given the code's nature and no suspicious activity.\n- The reports' scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is justified.\n- Given the code's role as a wrapper, the potential for risk exists only if external modules are malicious, but this is outside the scope of the script itself.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume external modules could contain malicious code. While possible, there's no evidence here.\n- The code itself is straightforward and safe; the risk lies in the external dependencies, which are standard for build tools.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a typical CLI wrapper with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just standard build orchestration)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured CLI tool for building Python packages. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
