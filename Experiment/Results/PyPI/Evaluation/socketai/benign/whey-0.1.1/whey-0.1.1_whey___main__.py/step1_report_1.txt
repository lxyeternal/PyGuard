{
  "purpose": "This script provides a command-line interface for building Python project distributions, including wheels, source distributions, and binary distributions.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line arguments, environment variables, and user inputs via click options and arguments.",
  "sinks": "Output includes build actions, print statements, and sys.exit calls; no data is written to untrusted destinations, but build functions may execute external processes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from command-line arguments to internal variables, then to build functions via foreman methods; environment variables influence options.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code utilizes standard libraries and third-party packages. No obfuscated code, malicious URLs, or suspicious behavior detected. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper around the whey build system, leveraging well-known libraries like click and consolekit. It handles user inputs, manages build directories, and calls build methods on the Foreman object. No suspicious code, malicious functions, or risky patterns are observed. The script primarily orchestrates build commands without executing untrusted code or external network requests. Use of environment variables and arguments appears safe and intended for normal operation. Overall, the code performs legitimate build orchestration with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical CLI wrapper for project build automation, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses common patterns and libraries without suspicious activity.",
