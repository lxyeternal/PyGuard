{
  "purpose": "The code is responsible for loading project configuration and orchestrating the build process for different distribution formats (sdist, binary, wheel).",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from 'pyproject.toml' files located in the project directory and its parent directories.",
  "sinks": "The code passes configuration data and paths to builder objects and calls their build methods, which could potentially be unsafe if the builders are malicious or poorly implemented.",
  "flows": "Source: 'load_toml' reads 'pyproject.toml'; flow to builder instantiation and calling 'build()' method, which generates distribution files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present. No network or suspicious data handling is visible.",
  "analysis": "The script loads configuration data from a 'pyproject.toml' file located by traversing upward from a specified project directory. It uses this configuration to select and instantiate builder classes for different distribution formats. The builder objects' 'build()' methods are called to generate distribution files. All data flow involves configuration and filesystem paths. There is no evident user input, network activity, or insecure data handling. The code relies on external, presumably safe, builder implementations. No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration-driven build orchestrator with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It operates on local files and external builder classes, which are assumed to be safe. Overall, it poses no security threat based on the provided code.",
