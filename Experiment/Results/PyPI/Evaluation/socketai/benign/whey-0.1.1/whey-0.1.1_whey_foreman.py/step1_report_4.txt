  "purpose": "The code is responsible for loading project configuration and orchestrating the build process for different distribution formats (sdist, binary, wheel) in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'project_dir' parameter during initialization, which is traversed to find 'pyproject.toml'; loads configuration data from this file; accepts parameters for build directories, output directories, verbosity, and color options in build methods.",
  "sinks": "Uses configuration data (potentially untrusted) to instantiate builder classes; calls the 'build()' method on these builder objects; potentially executes external build processes via these methods.",
  "flows": "Project directory traversal -> Loading 'pyproject.toml' -> Selecting builder based on configuration -> Calling builder's 'build()' method with parameters -> Returning build artifact filename.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious external network connections. The code dynamically loads configuration and executes build processes through external builder classes, which are not shown here; the actual behavior depends on those classes. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads configuration from a 'pyproject.toml' file by traversing directories. It retrieves builder classes from the configuration and executes their 'build()' methods with supplied parameters. The flow relies on external builder classes imported from 'whey.builder', which are not shown. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior is evident. The design appears standard for a build orchestration tool. Security depends on the trustworthiness of 'load_toml', 'traverse_to_file', and the builder implementations, but no malicious code is present here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical build orchestrator for Python projects, loading configurations and invoking external builder classes. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are apparent within this module. Its behavior is dependent on external components, but this snippet itself appears safe.",
