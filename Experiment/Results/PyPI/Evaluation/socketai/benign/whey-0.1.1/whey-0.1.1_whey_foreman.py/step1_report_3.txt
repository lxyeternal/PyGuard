{
  "purpose": "The code defines a 'Foreman' class responsible for loading project configuration and invoking specific build processes (sdist, binary, wheel) based on configuration data from 'pyproject.toml'.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from 'pyproject.toml' via 'load_toml'. It also traverses directories to locate 'pyproject.toml' using 'traverse_to_file'.",
  "sinks": "The code invokes methods on builder objects returned by 'get_builder', which are dynamically loaded based on configuration. These builder objects then perform the build process.",
  "flows": "Input source: 'load_toml' and 'traverse_to_file' load configuration; 'get_builder' retrieves a builder class; builder instance is created and 'build()' method is called, which returns a filename.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code. No usage of dynamic execution, eval, or exec. The only potentially sensitive operation is reading configuration files, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code responsibly loads configuration data from a 'pyproject.toml' file located by traversing directories upward. It then retrieves builder classes from configuration and invokes their 'build()' methods to produce distributions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard for their functions. All operations are typical of a build automation script.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard build automation class without malicious or suspicious activity. It handles configuration loading, dynamic class retrieval, and build invocation safely, based on the provided code. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
