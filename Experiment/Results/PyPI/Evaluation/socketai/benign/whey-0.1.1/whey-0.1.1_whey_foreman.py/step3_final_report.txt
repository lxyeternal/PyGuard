{
  "purpose": "The code orchestrates the build process for a Python project by loading configuration from 'pyproject.toml' and invoking specified builder classes for different distribution formats (sdist, binary, wheel).",
  "sources": "Directory traversal to locate 'pyproject.toml', loading configuration via 'load_toml', and retrieving builder classes based on configuration entries.",
  "sinks": "Calling the 'build()' method on builder instances, which perform the actual distribution creation.",
  "flows": "Traverse directory -> load configuration -> retrieve builder class -> instantiate builder -> invoke 'build()' method.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution. Usage of external modules and builder classes appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward build orchestrator that loads configuration from a 'pyproject.toml' file, locates builder classes based on configuration, and executes their 'build()' methods. It relies on external modules and classes, which are assumed to be safe. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The main risk lies in trusting external builder implementations and configuration data, but within this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe build orchestration component with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Its security posture is high, with minimal risk primarily associated with external dependencies and configuration trustworthiness. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting reliance on external components but no direct vulnerabilities.",
