{
  "purpose": "The code provides a framework for building Python package distributions, including source (sdist) and wheel (bdist) formats. It manages source copying, metadata generation, archive creation, and handles environment variables for reproducibility.",
  "sources": "Configuration files (pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, README), environment variables (SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH), source code files, license files, and metadata.",
  "sinks": "File writes for archives, metadata, README, LICENSE, and source files; environment variables for timestamps; archive creation via tarfile and zipfile modules.",
  "flows": "Source files and configuration data are read; metadata and files are processed; archives are created; environment variables influence timestamps; files are written to build directories and archives.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Usage of SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is standard for reproducibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard build system for Python packages. It performs typical tasks such as copying source files, generating metadata, creating source and wheel archives, and handling build metadata. No suspicious patterns, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are present. External libraries used are common for packaging tasks. Environment variables are used appropriately for reproducibility. The logic aligns with best practices for Python packaging, and no anomalies or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Python packaging utility with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. It employs common practices and external libraries suitable for its purpose. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting routine build operations without security concerns.",
