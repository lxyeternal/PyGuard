{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to build Python distribution packages, including source distributions (sdist) and wheel binary distributions, using metadata from pyproject.toml.",
  "sources": "Data read from pyproject.toml, project directory, and configuration attributes such as 'authors', 'dependencies', 'scripts', etc.",
  "sinks": "File writes for source code, metadata, license, README, and archive files. Also, directory operations like copy and delete, and environment variables for timestamps.",
  "flows": "Configuration and metadata are read from pyproject.toml and config attributes (sources). Files are copied or written to build directory and archives are created (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, network connections, or obfuscation detected. Use of standard libraries and third-party modules appears legitimate and relevant to package building.",
  "analysis": "The script implements a structured process for building source and wheel distributions, including copying source files, generating metadata, and writing archive files. No signs of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. All file operations are related to packaging. Environment variables are used for reproducible timestamps, which is standard practice. External libraries are used appropriately for their purpose. No anomalous code patterns, malicious logic, or obfuscation observed. The code appears to be a legitimate package build tool with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive package builder with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard packaging operations securely and transparently. Overall security risk is very low.",
