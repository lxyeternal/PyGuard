  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard, well-structured Python package build system.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The use of environment variables like `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` aligns with best practices for reproducible builds.\n- File operations, metadata handling, and archive creation are typical for such build scripts.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present.\n- The third-party modules used are common and appropriate for the task.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk is low, generally around 0.1–0.2.\n- Confidence levels are high (~0.9–0.95), reflecting strong agreement on the benign nature.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no claims are based on assumptions or misinterpretations.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is designed for legitimate packaging, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| **0**          | **0**             | **0.1–0.2**  |\n\n**Justification:**\n- The code performs typical build tasks, with no evidence of malicious activity.\n- Environment variables used are standard for reproducibility, not malicious purposes.\n- No suspicious code or network activity detected.\n- The consistent low scores across reports reinforce that the code is benign.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, standard build script risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe overall security assessment indicates this is a legitimate, safe build system for Python packages with no malicious or obfuscated components.",
