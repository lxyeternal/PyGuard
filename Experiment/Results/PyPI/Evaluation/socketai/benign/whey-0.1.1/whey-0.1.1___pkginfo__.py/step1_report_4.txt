  "purpose": "Define dependency groups for package setup, specifying optional requirements.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it solely defines static data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets static variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module defining an __all__ list and a dictionary of optional dependencies. It contains no external input handling, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. All dependencies are typical for Python projects, and there are no signs of malicious intent. The comments indicate management by a helper tool, suggesting this is a maintained configuration file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency specification with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be a normal, safely written configuration module.",
