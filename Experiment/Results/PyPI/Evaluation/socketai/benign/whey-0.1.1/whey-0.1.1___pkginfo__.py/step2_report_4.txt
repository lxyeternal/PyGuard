  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the corresponding code to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**Overall code review:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward Python module defining a list `__all__` and a dictionary `extras_require` with dependency groups.\n- The code contains only static data assignments, no dynamic execution, no external input handling.\n- The comments indicate management by 'repo_helper', suggesting automated or controlled updates.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The dependencies listed are standard Python packages with version constraints.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None detected.\n- **External data handling:** None.\n- **Dynamic code execution:** None.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with straightforward static data.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code is benign and only specifies dependencies.\n- **Confidence:** 1, high confidence in the benign nature.\n\n### Critical observations:\n\n- All reports are consistent in their assessments.\n- The dependency specifications and comments are standard practice.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified here.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:** The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and should be maintained.\n- **Potential for higher risk:** None; the code is benign.\n- **Potential for malicious activity:** None; no evidence supports any malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is a typical, safe dependency declaration.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated content, and assign appropriate scores. No changes are necessary.",
