  "purpose": "Define optional dependencies for the Python project, specifying groups like 'readme', 'editable', and 'all'.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of dependency lists within the extras_require dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static data used only for dependency specification.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code is purely static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python module declaring dependency groups, managed by 'repo_helper'. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, or external data processing. The dependency specifications are standard, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and clarity support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static dependency declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent; no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
