  "purpose": "Define optional dependencies for a Python project, managed by 'repo_helper'.",
  "sources": "Assignment of dependencies lists to 'extras_require' dictionary.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external effects.",
  "flows": "None; static data assignment without external input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated content. Usage of version specifiers is standard for dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of optional dependency groups for a Python package, with clear structure and no dynamic code execution or external data inputs. The comment indicates automated management, which is typical and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign configuration file specifying dependencies. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
