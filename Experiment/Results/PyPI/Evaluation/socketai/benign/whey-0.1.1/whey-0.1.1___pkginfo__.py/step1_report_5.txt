  "purpose": "Define optional dependencies for a Python project, likely for documentation and editing features.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements that assign data to variables (__all__, extras_require). No input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The comment indicates automatic management but does not affect security.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a list of modules and dependencies with version specifications for optional features. It is a standard dependency declaration in Python setup/configuration files. No malicious code, external data reading, or dangerous logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dependency declaration snippet without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only specifies dependencies for optional features in a package setup.",
