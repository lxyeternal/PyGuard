  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, and no unusual code behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple declaration of a dictionary named extras_require, listing optional dependencies. It includes a comment indicating the file is managed and should not be edited directly. There are no input, output, or dynamic behaviors. No code injection, malicious commands, or suspicious activity is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet used for dependency management. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
