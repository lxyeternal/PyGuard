  "purpose": "Defines optional dependencies for a Python project, managed automatically by 'repo_helper'.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own static configuration data; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static data configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains standard dependency specification with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a list of publicly available dependencies with specific version constraints. It is a straightforward configuration file with no dynamic execution, no input handling, and no code that interacts with the system or network. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet for dependency management, with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
