  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration script.\n- The only notable external dependency is the import of `binaryornot` to retrieve version info.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of untrusted input is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is static, configuration-oriented, and benign in nature.\n\n**Specific points per report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Malware score: 0**\n- **Risk score: 0**\n- Justified: No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same as above, consistent and justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same assessment, consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same as above, consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Security risk score: 0.1**\n- **Malware score: 0**\n- The only difference is a slightly elevated security risk score, but still no evidence of actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- Justification: Since no actual security issues are present, this score seems marginally inflated.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n  The risk scores are mostly 0, with one at 0.1, which is still very low. Given the absence of any suspicious activity, these scores are justified.\n\n- **Are there any signs of obfuscation or malicious intent?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward configuration code, importing a known package for version info.\n\n- **Are any claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 or very close to it; 0.1 in one report is slightly high but still acceptable considering the context.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration script with no malicious or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with the minor exception of a 0.1 risk score which I would consider as effectively 0.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as safe and non-malicious. The scores are consistent with the analysis. No further action or concern is warranted.",
