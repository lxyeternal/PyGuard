  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data read from code files, environment variables, network connections, or user inputs within the package.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs to network, file system, environment variables, or system commands that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network transmissions or file writes, potentially enabling malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are absent or contain no suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the lack of malicious code, with scores reflecting minimal risk. Malware scores are 0, obfuscated scores are 0, and risk scores are low (around 0.1 to 0.2), justified by the absence of concrete evidence. Confidence levels are appropriate, especially when no code is present. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The reasoning is consistent across reports, and the scoring aligns with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and confidence levels are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
