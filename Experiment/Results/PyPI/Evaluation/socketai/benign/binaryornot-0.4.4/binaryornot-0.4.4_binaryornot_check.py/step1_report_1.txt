{
  "purpose": "To determine whether a given file is binary or text based on its extension and content.",
  "sources": "The function reads the filename input and retrieves the starting chunk of the file via get_starting_chunk.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or process untrusted data beyond reading the file content; no direct sinks for sensitive data or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> Check extension -> Retrieve starting chunk -> Analyze chunk for binary content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. Usage of external helper functions is standard; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple file type check based on extension and content analysis. It imports logging but only uses it for debugging, with no other suspicious operations. Helper functions are imported but not provided; their behavior appears standard for file content analysis. The logic is straightforward and does not include any malicious or malicious-looking constructs. No external network access, data exfiltration, or code injection mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for detecting binary files based on extension and content analysis. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
