{
  "purpose": "To check if a file is binary or text by examining its extension and content.",
  "sources": "The filename parameter passed to the is_binary function; the get_starting_chunk function call.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink that leads to data leakage or malicious actions; no untrusted data execution.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> extension check and get_starting_chunk -> is_binary_string -> return result.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to determine if a file is binary by first checking its extension against a whitelist, then inspecting the file content's starting bytes. The extension list is minimal, containing only '.pyc'. It calls helper functions get_starting_chunk and is_binary_string, whose implementations are not shown, to analyze file content. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious behavior. No malicious intent or malicious code patterns are evident. It functions as a utility to identify binary files, common in file analysis tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for binary file detection, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
