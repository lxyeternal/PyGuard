  "purpose": "Determine whether a given file is binary or text based on its extension and initial content.",
  "sources": "The filename parameter in is_binary function; get_starting_chunk function call.",
  "targets": "Potentially the get_starting_chunk and is_binary_string functions which process file data.",
  "flows": "Filename input -> extension check -> get_starting_chunk -> is_binary_string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. No obfuscation or unusual constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the file extension against a predefined list and then analyzes the initial file chunk if the extension does not match. Uses external helper functions to read file content and assess whether it's binary. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is evident. The module appears to perform a straightforward utility function with no network activity, data exfiltration, or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility to identify binary files, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on helper functions for core functionality but does not contain malicious patterns itself.",
