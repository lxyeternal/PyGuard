  "purpose": "Check if a file is binary based on extension and content analysis.",
  "sources": "File extension check, get_starting_chunk() helper, is_binary_string() helper",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external effects",
  "flows": "Filename extension check -> get_starting_chunk() -> is_binary_string()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; minimal extension list, reliance on external helpers presumed benign",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility that determines if a file is binary by checking its extension against a small whitelist and analyzing its initial bytes. The helper functions' implementations are not provided but are assumed to perform standard content analysis. No malicious or suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code's logic is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The reliance on external helpers introduces a minimal dependency risk, but their naming suggests benign behavior. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscated score as 0, and security risk as approximately 0.1, reflecting the benign nature of the code and minimal external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for detecting binary files, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
