{
  "purpose": "Determine whether a given file is binary or text based on its extension and content.",
  "sources": "filename parameter passed to is_binary(), get_starting_chunk() function, and the filename string itself.",
  "targets": "No clear untrusted input sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; the code only performs checks.",
  "flows": "Input filename → extension check or get_starting_chunk() → is_binary_string() → output boolean",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed; the code relies on helper functions not shown here.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the filename extension against a known list and then inspects the file content via helper functions. There are no indications of malicious intent or malware. The only potential concern is the reliance on external helper functions which are not provided, but their names suggest benign behavior. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data leaks are evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility for file type detection with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates safely within its scope.",
