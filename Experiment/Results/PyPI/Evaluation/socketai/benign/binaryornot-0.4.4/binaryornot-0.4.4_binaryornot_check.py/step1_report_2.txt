{
  "purpose": "To determine whether a given file is binary or text by checking its extension and initial content.",
  "sources": "The filename parameter, specifically the filename string and the get_starting_chunk function which reads file content.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leakage points; the code only performs checks and returns boolean results.",
  "flows": "Filename string is checked for extension; if not binary by extension, the file content is read and analyzed for binary signature.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a static list of binary file extensions; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports logging and helper functions, then defines a function to check if a file is binary. It logs a debug message, checks the filename extension against a known list, and if not matched, reads the starting chunk of the file to analyze if it is binary. The approach is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign utility function for file type checking with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard and secure in the context of its purpose.",
