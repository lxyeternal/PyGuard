  "purpose": "Utility functions for identifying binary files, printing hex representations, and reading file chunks, used by BinaryOrNot.",
  "sources": "Reading filenames, file contents, and environment data for encoding detection.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; print statements and file reads are present, but no external data is sent or stored.",
  "flows": "File input flows into functions like get_starting_chunk and is_binary_string; no flow leads to external network or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of logger.debug for internal diagnostics, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; conditionally importing chr() for Python 2, which is standard compatibility code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for binary detection and file chunk reading. It reads files in binary mode, analyzes byte patterns, and uses chardet for encoding detection. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. The code performs straightforward file analysis with no external network communication or malicious payloads. It mainly uses standard libraries and debugging logs for internal diagnostics. The conditional for Python 2/3 compatibility is normal. No hardcoded credentials or malicious obfuscation are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for binary detection and file reading. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It functions as intended for file analysis without security risks.",
