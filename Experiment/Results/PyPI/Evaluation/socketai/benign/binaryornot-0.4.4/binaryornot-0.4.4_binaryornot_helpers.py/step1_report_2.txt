  "purpose": "Helper utilities for analyzing file content, including reading files, printing data in hex, and detecting if a byte sequence is binary or text.",
  "sources": "Reading files with open(filename, 'rb'), data checks on byte sequences, chardet detection results.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data for effects; functions mainly analyze and print data or return boolean results.",
  "flows": "File reading leads to binary detection logic; data flows from file read to analysis functions and logging.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses `bytes is str` check, which is a Python 2/3 compatibility pattern; no other suspicious or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign operations: reading files, printing hex, and detecting binary vs. text content. It uses established methods for detection, including chardet for encoding detection. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. The only notable aspect is the Python version compatibility handling, which is standard. No suspicious data exfiltration, network operations, or obfuscated code features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for file analysis and binary detection, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
