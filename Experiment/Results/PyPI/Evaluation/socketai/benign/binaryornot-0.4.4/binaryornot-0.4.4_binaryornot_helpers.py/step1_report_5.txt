{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for analyzing file content, including printing as hex, reading file chunks, and determining if byte sequences are binary or text.",
  "sources": "File reading in get_starting_chunk, and chardet.detect() for encoding detection.",
  "sinks": "None evident; functions do not write untrusted data to external systems or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "File content is read and analyzed locally; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code includes compatibility handling for Python 2 and 3, but no malicious behavior is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign functions such as reading file chunks and analyzing byte sequences to determine if files are binary or text. It uses standard libraries like chardet for encoding detection and logging for debugging. No data leakage, system commands, or suspicious network activity is present. The functions are straightforward utility routines with no indications of malicious intent. Compatibility handling is typical for supporting older Python versions. The logging statements provide debugging info but do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module used for file content analysis. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks. It functions solely for classification and debugging purposes without engaging in unsafe or suspicious operations.",
