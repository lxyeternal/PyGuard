  "purpose": "Utility functions for reading file chunks, printing hex, and detecting if a byte sequence is binary or text.",
  "sources": "File reading functions, chardet detection, and internal heuristics for binary detection.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications; purely analytical functions.",
  "flows": "Reads file data -> analyzes control characters and encoding -> determines binary or text.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'if bytes is str' check, which is invalid in Python 3 and suggests a bug or leftover from Python 2.",
  "analysis": "The code provides benign utility functions for file analysis. The only notable issue is the 'if bytes is str' line, which would cause a runtime error in Python 3 but does not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The scoring across reports correctly assigns malware and obfuscation scores as 0, with low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2) reflecting the syntax bug rather than security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for file detection with a minor syntax bug that could cause runtime errors but no malicious or security threat. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
