  "purpose": "Utility functions for binary file detection and analysis, including reading file chunks, printing hex representations, and detecting whether a byte sequence is binary or text.",
  "sources": "Reading file contents in get_starting_chunk, input bytes in is_binary_string, chardet detection results.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is sent over networks or stored insecurely. No sink functions that handle untrusted data directly lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "File read in get_starting_chunk provides data to is_binary_string; data flows through detection logic involving chardet detection and byte analysis.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a redundant check 'if bytes is str' which is syntactically invalid in Python 3; likely a typo or leftover from Python 2. Also, no logging level configuration shown, but this does not imply malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors identified. The code's primary purpose is benign file analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code implements file reading and byte analysis functions to determine if a file is binary or text, using heuristic checks including control characters and high ASCII content, as well as chardet encoding detection. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code injections. The code appears to be a utility module for file type detection. The apparent 'if bytes is str' condition is invalid in Python 3 and likely a bug or leftover; it does not introduce malicious behavior. No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation techniques are present. No suspicious patterns or backdoors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for detecting binary versus text files. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain security risks. The only concern is the invalid Python syntax which may cause runtime errors but does not impact security or indicate malicious intent.",
