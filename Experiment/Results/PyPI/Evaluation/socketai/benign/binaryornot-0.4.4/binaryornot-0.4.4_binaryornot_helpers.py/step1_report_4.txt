{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for handling and analyzing binary and text files, including printing in hex, reading file chunks, and detecting if a byte sequence is binary or text.",
  "sources": "File reading in get_starting_chunk function, input data passed to is_binary_string function, and data from chardet detection.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; functions process data internally without writing or transmitting untrusted data.",
  "flows": "File data is read in get_starting_chunk and passed to is_binary_string; detection involves analyzing byte patterns and encoding detection, with no external network or file modification involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. The code only performs file I/O, data analysis, and logging. The use of chardet for encoding detection is standard and does not introduce risk. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper utilities to read files, print data as hex, and analyze byte sequences to determine if they are binary or text. It employs standard methods such as file reading in binary mode, translation of bytes for ASCII control characters, and encoding detection via chardet. Logging is used for debugging purposes. No potentially malicious behaviors such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration are present. The code appears to be straightforward and solely focused on file analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed for file type detection and utility functions without any malicious intent. It uses standard libraries and methods, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
