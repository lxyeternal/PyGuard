  "purpose": "A simple Python script that outputs 'hello world' with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "N/A (no input or data reading operations present).",
  "sinks": "N/A (no untrusted data handling or external data sinks).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from sources to sinks, as there are no sources or sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a basic print statement with no inputs, data flows, external dependencies, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or security concerns are evident. The code poses no threat, and the analysis confirms its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
