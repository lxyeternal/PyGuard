  "purpose": "This code defines metadata variables for a Python package, including author, email, and version information.",
  "sources": "None; the code only assigns static string values to metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows, inputs, or outputs.",
  "flows": "None; no dynamic data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, functions, or logic; only metadata assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only metadata declarations, which are standard in Python package setup files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, data leakage, or obfuscation. No external inputs, data processing, or potentially dangerous operations are present. This pattern is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple metadata header for a Python package with no malicious intent or security concerns. It serves informational purposes only.",
