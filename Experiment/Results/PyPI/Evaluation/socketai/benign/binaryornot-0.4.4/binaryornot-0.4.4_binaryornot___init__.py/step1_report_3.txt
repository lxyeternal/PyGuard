  "purpose": "Metadata declaration for a Python package or module, specifying author, email, and version information.",
  "sources": "Code reads hardcoded strings for author, email, and version attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static metadata assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; simple attribute assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments to metadata variables. No input reading, no data processing, and no external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be standard package metadata declaration typical in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as standard metadata for a Python package. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
