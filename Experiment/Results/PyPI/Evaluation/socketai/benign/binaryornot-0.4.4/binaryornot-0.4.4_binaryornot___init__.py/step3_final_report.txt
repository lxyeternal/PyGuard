  "purpose": "Declare package metadata such as author, email, and version information.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments (__author__, __email__, __version__).",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignments do not involve untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and contains no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments for package metadata. There are no input/output operations, dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code is typical for package setup files and does not pose any security risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless package metadata declaration with no malicious or suspicious activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring reflects this. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
