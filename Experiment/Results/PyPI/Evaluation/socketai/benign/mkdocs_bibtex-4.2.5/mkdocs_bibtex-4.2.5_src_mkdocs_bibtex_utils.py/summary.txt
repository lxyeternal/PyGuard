  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign downloader utility for bibliographic data, including Zotero API support. It does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The primary security concern is handling untrusted sources, which is typical for such utilities but does not indicate malicious intent. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified."
