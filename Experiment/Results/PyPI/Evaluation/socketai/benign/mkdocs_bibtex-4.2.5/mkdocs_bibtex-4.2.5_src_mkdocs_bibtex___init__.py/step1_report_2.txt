  "purpose": "Import necessary modules and determine the version of the package or module, likely for configuration or compatibility purposes.",
  "sources": "sys module for Python version info, importlib_metadata or importlib.metadata for retrieving package version.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info is used to determine import path; metadata.version retrieves package/module version information.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward check of Python version to decide which metadata import to use, then retrieves the version of the current package or module. It uses standard library modules and common practices for version handling. No data leaks, obfuscated code, or malicious intent detected. The code is minimal and appears to be for configuration or environment setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for managing package versioning with compatibility considerations. No malicious or security risks are present.",
