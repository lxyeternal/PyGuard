  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies that the code retrieves package version info with compatibility handling. No anomalies, malicious activity, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Verdict:** The analysis is accurate; the code is standard, safe, and straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. These are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it correctly describes the code's purpose and safety. No suspicious behavior or anomalies.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; the code is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, it describes standard compatibility and version retrieval logic. No anomalies or malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, correctly notes the standard pattern of conditional import and version retrieval. No suspicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Valid assessment.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. Also appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, but notes a slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk (0.1). The reasoning is still consistent with benign code, but perhaps the lower confidence and risk score are overly cautious.\n- **Verdict:** The code is standard; the small risk score might be an overestimation unless there's context not visible here.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1. This seems slightly high given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence:** The code in all reports is consistent, standard, and benign.\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign malware=0.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign obfuscated=0, which is correct.\n- **Risk scores:** The risk scores are mostly 0, except report 5, which assigns 0.1. Given the code's simplicity and safety, even 0.1 seems unjustified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements.\n- The minor risk score in report 5 should be reduced to 0, aligning with the others.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores are correct at 0 across all reports.\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, benign pattern for version compatibility and metadata retrieval, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
