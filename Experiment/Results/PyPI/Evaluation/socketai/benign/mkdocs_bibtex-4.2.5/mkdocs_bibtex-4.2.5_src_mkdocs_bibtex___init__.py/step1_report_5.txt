  "purpose": "This code imports and sets up version retrieval for a Python plugin, specifically for mkdocs_bibtex.",
  "sources": "Reads the Python version info from sys.version_info and the package version using importlib.metadata or fallback.",
  "sinks": "Uses metadata.version to retrieve package version; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> retrieves package version via metadata.version.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected. The use of version_info for compatibility is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version compatibility, imports the correct metadata module accordingly, and retrieves the package version. No malicious intent or suspicious patterns are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version compatibility setup and package version retrieval without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
