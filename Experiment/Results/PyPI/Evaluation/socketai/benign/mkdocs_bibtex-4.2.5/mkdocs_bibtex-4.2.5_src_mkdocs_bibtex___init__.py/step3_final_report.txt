  "purpose": "Retrieve the package or module version information with compatibility support for different Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version info from sys.version_info and the package/module name from __package__ or __name__, then calls metadata.version() to get version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only accesses system and package metadata.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info check → conditional import → metadata.version(__package__ or __name__)",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version retrieval pattern with no suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard compatibility check for Python versions >= 3.8, importing 'metadata' from the appropriate module, then retrieves the version of the current package or module. It uses well-established practices without obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. No external network activity, data leaks, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is simple, clear, and intended solely for version information retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for obtaining package version info with compatibility support. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The previously noted minor security risk score of 0.1 is unjustified; the correct risk score is 0.",
