{
  "purpose": "The code determines the Python version and imports the appropriate module for metadata retrieval, then fetches the package version.",
  "sources": "Reading Python version info from sys.version_info; importing modules; reading package metadata with metadata.version()",
  "sinks": "metadata.version() potentially accessing package metadata, which is safe; no external sinks present",
  "flows": "sys.version_info used for conditional import; metadata.version() retrieves package version info",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; conditional import based on Python version is standard; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'importlib.metadata' for Python >= 3.8 and falls back to 'importlib_metadata' for older versions, which is standard practice. It then retrieves the version of the current package or module using 'metadata.version()'. All operations are typical and do not exhibit malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard version detection and package metadata retrieval without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for a Python package setup.",
