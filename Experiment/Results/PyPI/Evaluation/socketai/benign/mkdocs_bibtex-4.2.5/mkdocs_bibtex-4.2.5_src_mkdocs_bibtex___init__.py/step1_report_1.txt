  "purpose": "The code retrieves the version information of the current package or module, primarily for compatibility handling between different Python versions.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, __package__, __name__",
  "targets": "metadata.version() call",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> conditional import -> metadata.version(__package__ or __name__)",
  "anomalies": "None observed; standard pattern for version retrieval with compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The script imports system modules and a third-party plugin. It conditionally imports 'metadata' from 'importlib' or 'importlib_metadata' based on Python version, then retrieves the package version. The logic is straightforward and uses standard practices for compatibility across Python versions. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious imports, or suspicious behavior. No data leaks or malicious sinks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version retrieval pattern with compatibility support. No malicious activity, malware, or security risks detected.",
