{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration options for the BibTex plugin in mkdocs, including file paths, commands, and formatting flags.",
  "sources": "User-supplied paths or URLs for bib_file, bib_dir, csl_file; configuration options for commands and flags.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or execute these inputs, only stores them.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static assignment of configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "None; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static class defining configuration options with default values and types. It contains no dynamic code, external data fetching, or execution. The URLs and paths are user-configurable but not processed within this code. The structure is straightforward, schema-like, and serves as a configuration schema. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal security risk arises only if the plugin later processes these inputs insecurely, but that is outside this static definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, declarative configuration class with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1) for potential misuse of user inputs, which is acceptable given the static nature of the code.",
