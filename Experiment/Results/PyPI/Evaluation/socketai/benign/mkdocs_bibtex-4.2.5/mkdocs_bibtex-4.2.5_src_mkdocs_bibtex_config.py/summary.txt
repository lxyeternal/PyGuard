  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, declarative configuration class with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1) for potential misuse of user inputs, which is acceptable given the static nature of the code."
