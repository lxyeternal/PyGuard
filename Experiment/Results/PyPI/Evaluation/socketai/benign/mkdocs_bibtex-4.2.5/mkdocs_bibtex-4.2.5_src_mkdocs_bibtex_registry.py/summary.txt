  "conclusion": "The code appears secure, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified by external file handling and regex parsing, which are typical in citation processing tools. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly zero. Overall, the implementation is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
