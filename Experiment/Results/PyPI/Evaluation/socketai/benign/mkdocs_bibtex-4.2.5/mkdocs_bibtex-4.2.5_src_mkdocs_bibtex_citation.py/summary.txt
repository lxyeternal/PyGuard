  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign markdown citation parser with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minor logging in exception handling is acceptable and does not impact security. The current scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are 0, and the security risk is negligible (around 0.1 due to logging)."
