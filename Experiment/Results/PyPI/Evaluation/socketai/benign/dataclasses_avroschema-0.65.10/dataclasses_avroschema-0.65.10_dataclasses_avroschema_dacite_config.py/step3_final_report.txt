  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing common data types (datetime, date, time, bytes, UUID) from strings or other inputs, and generating a dacite configuration with custom type hooks based on a model schema.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to parsing functions (strings, datetime, date, time, bytes, UUID), and attributes accessed within generate_dacite_config (model.generate_schema(), model._parser.metadata.dacite_config, model._parser.dataclass).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; the code performs in-memory data conversions and configuration setup without external effects.",
  "flows": "Input data (strings) flow through parsing functions to produce typed data; model.generate_schema() and attribute access occur during configuration setup, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; reliance on model attributes assumes trusted models; no obfuscation, code injection, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides safe, standard utility functions for data parsing, using well-known libraries. The generate_dacite_config function constructs a configuration object for the dacite library, incorporating user-specified and default type hooks. It calls model.generate_schema() and accesses model attributes, which are typical in schema-based deserialization. No external network, file I/O, or obfuscated code is involved. The functions do not handle untrusted external data directly in a risky manner. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code. The only potential concern is the trustworthiness of the model object, but this is outside static analysis scope. Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility module for data parsing and configuration generation, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware score is zero, obfuscation is zero, and security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2) due to reliance on external model objects but no actual vulnerabilities. It can be considered safe for use in supply chain contexts.",
