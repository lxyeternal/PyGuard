  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility module for data parsing and configuration generation, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware score is zero, obfuscation is zero, and security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2) due to reliance on external model objects but no actual vulnerabilities. It can be considered safe for use in supply chain contexts."
