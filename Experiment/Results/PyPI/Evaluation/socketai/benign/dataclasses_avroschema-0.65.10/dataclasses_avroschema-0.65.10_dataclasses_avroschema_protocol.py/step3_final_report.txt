  "purpose": "Define protocols for parsing and representing data schemas, especially for Avro.",
  "sources": "Method signatures and class definitions; no external data input or runtime data handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process or output external data.",
  "flows": "Method calls are purely structural; no data flow from sources to sinks occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Python protocol classes, type annotations, and method signatures for schema parsing and serialization. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code is a standard interface layer for a larger system, with no indications of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and poses no security threat. All signals indicate a safe, standard implementation of schema interfaces.",
