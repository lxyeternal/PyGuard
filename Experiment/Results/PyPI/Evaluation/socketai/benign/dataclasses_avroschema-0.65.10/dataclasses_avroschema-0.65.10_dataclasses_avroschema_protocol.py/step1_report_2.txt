  "purpose": "Define protocols for parsing and representing Python data models as Avro schemas, including serialization and deserialization methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries and local modules; class method and function definitions; type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None observed that process untrusted input directly; no explicit data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flow involves class methods converting data between Python objects and serialized formats, but no untrusted data sources or sinks are evident in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code uses standard type hints and protocol classes without dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Protocol classes (ParserProtocol and ModelProtocol) for data modeling and schema generation. It employs type annotations, optional class attributes, and class methods for serialization logic. There are no external data sources, network interactions, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be a standard framework for data modeling and schema management, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It is purely structural and interface-oriented, intended for use in larger, secure systems.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard and safe abstraction layer for data schema handling, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain obfuscated code. Overall, it poses no security threat based on this review.",
