{
  "purpose": "Define protocols for parsing and modeling data schemas, particularly for Avro serialization.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard and internal modules; class and method definitions; type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or external communication found.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no data processing or transformations involving external input identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; no unusual or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of protocol class definitions for data schema parsing and serialization, with type annotations and method signatures. There are no operations involving external data input, network communication, or data leakage points. The code does not perform any computations, file manipulations, or environment interactions that could be malicious. It appears to be a standard, well-structured interface definition intended for use in a larger data serialization framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. It is a set of interface protocols defining data parsing and serialization schemas, with no evident malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
