{
  "purpose": "Import the Faker library for generating fake data, or provide a stub that raises an error if Faker is not installed.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'faker' module when attempting to import Faker.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or security issues are present.",
  "flows": "If Faker is available, the code proceeds normally; if not, it uses the FakeStub which raises an error upon attribute access.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a fallback stub class that raises a RuntimeError if Faker is missing, which is standard for handling optional dependencies. No unusual code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import the 'Faker' class from the 'faker' library. If the import fails due to ModuleNotFoundError, it defines a stub class 'FakeStub' that raises an error when any attribute is accessed, instructing the user to install the 'faker' package with optional features. This pattern is common for optional dependency handling and does not introduce malicious behavior. There are no obfuscated elements, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors. The fallback mechanism ensures the program fails fast if 'faker' is not installed, but does not execute any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for optional dependency management, with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply handles missing dependencies gracefully by raising informative errors. No malware or security concerns are detected.",
