  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The report correctly identifies that the code attempts to import 'faker' and defines a stub if unavailable.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No errors or logical flaws are evident. The fallback class raises a RuntimeError when methods are invoked, which is appropriate.\n- **Scores:** The malware score is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. The security risk is 0, and the obfuscated score is 0, all consistent.\n- **Justification:** The code is a standard pattern for optional dependencies; no malicious activity or obfuscation. The confidence is high (1).\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Correctly notes the import attempt and fallback behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues. The code handles missing dependencies gracefully.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0 matches the lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious or malicious activity is detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Accurately describes the import and fallback.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No flaws identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, consistent with the code.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Correctly describes the import and fallback.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, aligns with the code.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Correctly identifies the import and fallback pattern.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware score 0, consistent.\n- **Justification:** The code is a typical dependency handler with no malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- All reports correctly interpret the code.\n- The code pattern is a standard approach for optional dependencies.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The malware scores are appropriately set to 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk scores are also appropriately low.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly dependency management, but not entirely zero due to potential for misuse if the stub is called in untrusted contexts)\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, well-understood, and contains no malware or obfuscation. The scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary.",
