{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import and instantiate the Faker library for generating fake data; if not installed, it defines a stub class to raise an error when faker methods are invoked.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'faker' module when attempting to import it and when accessing fake.fake() methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of 'fake' object methods (e.g., fake.name(), fake.address()) could lead to data generation, but no data is sent externally in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data flow is minimal; the only flow is through method calls on 'fake' which may be dynamically invoked but are controlled within the code context.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a fallback stub that raises a RuntimeError if Faker is not installed, which is normal. No suspicious or malicious code such as network activity, file access, or data leaks is present.",
  "analysis": "The code safely handles the absence of the 'faker' library by providing a stub that raises an error if its methods are called. There are no malicious or suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. It simply manages optional dependency loading with proper error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for optional dependencies, providing a fallback that prevents malicious behavior. It does not exhibit any malware or security risks.",
