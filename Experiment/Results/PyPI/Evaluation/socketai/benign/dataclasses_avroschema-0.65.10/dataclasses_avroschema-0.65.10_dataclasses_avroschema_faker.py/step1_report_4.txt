{
  "purpose": "Import and provide a fallback stub for the Faker library to generate fake data, used for testing or data anonymization.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Faker module from the environment and checks for its availability. No other input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that could lead to data leaks or security issues. It only raises an error if Faker is not installed.",
  "flows": "Import attempt from Faker -> fallback to FakeStub class if ModuleNotFoundError occurs -> access to fake object or method.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior are present. The fallback class only raises a RuntimeError.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import the Faker library. If unavailable, it defines a stub class that raises a RuntimeError on attribute access, guiding the user to install Faker. The fallback does not execute any malicious code or hidden behaviors. No external data flows or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard pattern for optional dependencies with a clear fallback. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It serves as a safeguard against missing dependencies and provides a user guidance message.",
