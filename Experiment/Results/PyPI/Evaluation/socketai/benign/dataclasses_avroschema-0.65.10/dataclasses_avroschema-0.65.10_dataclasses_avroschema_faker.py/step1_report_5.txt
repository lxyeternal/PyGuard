{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import the Faker library to generate fake data, and provides a fallback stub class if Faker is not installed.",
  "sources": "The code reads the import statement for 'faker' and attempts to instantiate Faker() if available.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data flows; no input/output handling beyond the import and instantiation.",
  "flows": "The primary flow is from importing 'faker' to creating an instance of Faker() or, if unavailable, using the FakeStub class.",
  "anomalies": "The fallback class FakeStub raises a RuntimeError if its .fake() method is called when Faker is not installed, which is a standard error handling pattern; no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it tries to import the 'faker' library, which is used for generating fake data for testing or development purposes. If the import fails (ModuleNotFoundError), it defines a stub class that raises a RuntimeError when its .fake() method is invoked, instructing the user to install Faker. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behavior. The fallback mechanism ensures the code fails gracefully if Faker is missing. The code does not process untrusted input, write data, or perform any network or system operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe pattern for optional dependency handling with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It mainly ensures the program can handle missing 'faker' dependency gracefully.",
