  "purpose": "Handle optional dependency on 'faker' library; provide fallback that raises error if 'faker' is missing.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'faker'; instantiation of Faker(); attribute access on 'fake' object.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external effects.",
  "flows": "Import -> Faker() instantiation -> attribute access on 'fake' triggers error if 'faker' is missing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fallback class 'FakeStub' that raises RuntimeError on method calls; no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'faker' and instantiate it; if unavailable, defines a stub class that raises an error upon method invocation. This pattern is standard for optional dependencies and does not involve any malicious or suspicious behavior. No network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The fallback's error message guides users to install the missing package. All reports correctly identify this pattern as benign, with malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores set to 0. Confidence in the benign nature is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe pattern for optional dependencies with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
