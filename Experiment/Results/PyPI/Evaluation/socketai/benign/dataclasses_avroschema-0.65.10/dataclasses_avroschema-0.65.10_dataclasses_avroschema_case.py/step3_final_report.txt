  "purpose": "Utility functions for transforming nested dictionary fields' 'name' attributes into various case formats, primarily for schema normalization.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries and nested structures, especially 'name' keys, 'fields' lists, and nested dicts/lists.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is transformed in-memory without external system calls or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Source data (dicts/lists) -> case functions applied to 'name' fields -> transformed data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs recursive data transformations using safe string functions and a third-party library 'casefy'. It manipulates nested data structures for schema normalization without external system interaction or malicious intent. No obfuscation or security vulnerabilities are present. Reliance on 'casefy' is noted but not inherently malicious. The logic is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or code injection points.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for case normalization within nested data structures. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, reflecting minimal external dependency reliance but no actual threat.",
