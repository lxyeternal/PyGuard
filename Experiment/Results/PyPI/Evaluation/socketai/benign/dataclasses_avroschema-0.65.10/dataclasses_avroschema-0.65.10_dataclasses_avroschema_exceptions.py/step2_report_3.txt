  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines two custom exception classes: `InvalidMap` and `InvalidSymbol`.\n   - Each class has an `__init__` method to store relevant error information and `__repr__`/`__str__` methods to produce descriptive messages.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, input handling, external data processing, or network activity.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Security Implications:**\n   - The code serves as validation error handling, likely used within a larger application.\n   - The exception classes do not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The string representations are static and controlled; they do not process untrusted data beyond the provided arguments, which are assumed to be controlled by the application.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1), and no anomalies or obfuscation are detected.\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — The code is purely for validation exception handling, with no security risk.\n   \n   Since the code is purely utility and does not process untrusted data in a risky way, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is standard, benign, and does not pose security risks.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo further action needed. The code is safe and well-understood in its context.",
