  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Presence of Issues:**\n   - The code defines two custom exception classes, `InvalidMap` and `InvalidSymbol`, with constructors and string representations.\n   - The code is straightforward, standard for validation error handling.\n   - No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations are present.\n   - No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns are evident.\n   - The code appears benign and intended solely for validation purposes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is simple exception class definitions with no external data flow.\n   - No flaws or mistakes are apparent in their reasoning; their analysis aligns with the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious or obfuscated content.\n   - The `risk` scores are not explicitly listed but implied to be low or zero, which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores:**\n   - Since no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected, scores higher than 0.5 are unjustified.\n   - The code is purely utility, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume that exception classes are harmless, which is correct.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the code's content.\n   - No external inputs or data are involved, so injection or data-driven attacks are impossible here.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment.\n   - All scores align with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for validation. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current analysis and the nature of the code.",
