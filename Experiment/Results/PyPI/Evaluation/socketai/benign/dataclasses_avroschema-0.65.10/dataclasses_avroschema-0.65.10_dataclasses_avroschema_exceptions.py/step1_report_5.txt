  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for invalid map and symbol validation errors.",
  "sources": "No input sources; only class and method definitions for raising exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow to external systems or outputs present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or input/output processing in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exceptions, InvalidMap and InvalidSymbol, each with initialization and string representation methods. These classes are meant for validation purposes within a larger application. No input/output handling, external calls, or dynamic execution occurs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security vulnerabilities.",
