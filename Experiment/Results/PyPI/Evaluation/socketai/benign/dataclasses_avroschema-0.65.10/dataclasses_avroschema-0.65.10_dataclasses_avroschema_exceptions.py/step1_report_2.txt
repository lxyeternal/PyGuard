{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for invalid map structures and symbols, likely used for validation in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; code only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, no untrusted data handling or output that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as no data flow is present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions with standard methods.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two custom exception classes, InvalidMap and InvalidSymbol, used for validation errors. Both classes store information about the error (field name, key type, symbol) and provide string representations. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, input handling, or external data processing. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be standard validation utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of exception class definitions for validation purposes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.",
