  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for invalid map and symbol validation errors",
  "sources": "Exception initialization methods and string representations",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or inputs are involved; exceptions are used internally",
  "flows": "Exception creation and string conversion methods, not involving untrusted data flow",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; standard exception class definitions with no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, InvalidMap and InvalidSymbol, each with initialization and string representation methods. The classes are straightforward, used for validation error handling, and contain no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The __str__ methods provide formatted messages but do not involve untrusted data beyond provided arguments, which are typically controlled by the program logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions for validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security issues. It serves to provide descriptive errors for validation failures. There is no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
