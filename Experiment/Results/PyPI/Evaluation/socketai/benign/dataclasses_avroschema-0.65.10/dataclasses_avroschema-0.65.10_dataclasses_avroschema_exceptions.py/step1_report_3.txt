  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for invalid map and symbol validation errors.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; code only defines exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involved; classes only raise exceptions with descriptive messages.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely implements two custom exception classes, with constructors and string representations for error messages. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations. The use of __repr__ and __str__ methods for exception messages is standard. No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign implementation of custom exceptions for validation purposes. No malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
