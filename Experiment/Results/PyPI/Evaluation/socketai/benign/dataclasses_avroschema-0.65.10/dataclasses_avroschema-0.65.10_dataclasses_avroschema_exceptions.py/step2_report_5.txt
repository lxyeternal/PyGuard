  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:\n   - The code consists solely of two custom exception classes (`InvalidMap` and `InvalidSymbol`) with straightforward `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__str__` methods.\n   - No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations are present.\n   - The exception classes are standard and benign, used for validation error reporting.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is standard, benign, and intended for validation purposes.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n   - The reports do not miss any potential security issues because there are none.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No changes are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could pose a security risk, such as executing untrusted input, handling sensitive data, or including obfuscated/malicious payloads.\n   - Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score**:\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This aligns with the analysis that the code is purely for validation error reporting and contains no malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent.\n   - They acknowledge the code's purpose as validation utility classes.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is entirely benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's nature.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is standard, straightforward exception class definitions used for validation. There are no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements present. The current scores are justified and accurate.",
