  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of each report:**\n\n- All five reports uniformly state that the code defines two custom exception classes, `InvalidMap` and `InvalidSymbol`. They emphasize that the code is straightforward, with no external data handling, no dynamic or obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior. The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and obfuscated score of 0, indicating benign intent.\n\n**Confirming the code's behavior:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions, with constructors and string methods that format error messages. There are no external data inputs, no code execution beyond class initialization, and no network or file operations. The string representations use only provided arguments, which are presumably controlled by the application logic.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- The code is standard for validation error handling, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities.\n- No dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted data, and no external dependencies are involved.\n- The exception classes are simple and serve as part of validation logic, which is common and safe.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Any discrepancies or reasons to adjust scores?**\n\n- Since the code is unremarkable and standard, no adjustments are necessary. The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n\n- The reports assume the code is only for validation and contains no malicious behavior. Given the simplicity and lack of suspicious constructs, this seems justified.\n- No hidden or obfuscated malicious code is evident, and the code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The overall assessment aligns with the reports: the code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for validation purposes. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive elements are present. The provided reports are accurate and consistent with this assessment.",
