{
  "purpose": "The code defines two custom exception classes, InvalidMap and InvalidSymbol, used for validation error handling within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the arguments provided to the exception constructors (__init__ methods). No external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "The string representations (__str__ methods) generate messages based on internal state; no untrusted data is processed or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the constructor arguments into the __repr__ and __str__ methods to produce error messages; no external data flow or untrusted input processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, with standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two simple exception classes with no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity. The classes serve as validation error indicators. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The string methods use controlled data, and the code's purpose is purely for validation. The reports uniformly recognize this benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of validation exception classes with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
