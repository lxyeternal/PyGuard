{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for invalid map structures and invalid symbols, likely for input validation.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present, as the code only defines classes and methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code strictly defines exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two custom exception classes, InvalidMap and InvalidSymbol, each with initialization and string representation methods. There are no external data reads, no data processing, no network activity, or any other potentially malicious behavior. It appears to be part of a validation framework, possibly used elsewhere in a larger project. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payload, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and only defines custom exceptions for validation purposes. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
