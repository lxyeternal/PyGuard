  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines two custom exception classes, `InvalidMap` and `InvalidSymbol`.\n   - Each class has an `__init__` method to store relevant information and `__repr__` / `__str__` methods to produce descriptive error messages.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity.\n   - The classes are intended for validation error handling within a larger application.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n   - No external data inputs or outputs are involved.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data directly; it only formats messages based on provided arguments.\n   - The `__str__` methods produce messages that include variable data, but this data is controlled by the application, not external untrusted sources.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All five reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and intended for validation error handling.\n   - They consistently note the absence of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.\n   - The reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), indicating strong agreement.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — no security risk or vulnerabilities are present.\n   \n   These scores are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Misinterpretations**:\n   - The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions mean there's no hidden malicious behavior.\n   - The only possible concern might be if these exception classes are misused in a way that could cause information leakage, but nothing in the code suggests that.\n\n6. **Final Assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes.\n   - No adjustments needed for the scores.\n   - The detailed analysis supports the conclusion that this code poses no security threat.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's actual behavior. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
