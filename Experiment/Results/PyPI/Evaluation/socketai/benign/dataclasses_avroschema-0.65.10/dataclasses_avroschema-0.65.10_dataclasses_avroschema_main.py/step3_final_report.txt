{
  "purpose": "Provides schema management, serialization, deserialization, validation, and object instantiation for Avro data models.",
  "sources": "Class attributes, metadata, external libraries (dacite, fastavro), input data for deserialization.",
  "sinks": "Serialized bytes or JSON output, validation functions, object creation from dicts.",
  "flows": "Input data -> deserialization -> validation -> object instantiation or dict -> serialization -> output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard patterns for schema handling, caching, and data serialization. It uses external libraries appropriately and maintains clear data flow. No external network calls, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors are present. Cache mechanisms and class methods are typical for such utilities. The redundant json.loads(json.dumps()) pattern is benign. Overall, the implementation appears legitimate and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured data modeling utility for Avro schemas with no malicious or suspicious elements. It poses minimal security risk, and the current scores are appropriate.",
