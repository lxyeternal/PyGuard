{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility module for type introspection, model identification, and schema metadata management in a Python project, likely related to data validation or serialization frameworks.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes (e.g., 'schema_name', 'schema_doc') via getattr, imports modules like pydantic and faust, and accesses type annotations and special attributes within functions and class methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks that process untrusted external input; the code primarily performs type checks, attribute inspections, and data structure manipulations internally.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing optional modules, defining utility functions for type checking and annotation rebuilding, and creating schema/field metadata objects based on class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code structure is typical for type and schema handling. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or code injection. The use of optional imports and attribute-based logic is standard for flexible schema validation frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The module performs static introspection of types, classes, and annotations, using caching for performance. It checks for specific typing constructs and external libraries (pydantic, faust). The functions manage schema metadata and convert custom types, which are common in schema-based data validation. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity is detected. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for type and schema handling within a data modeling or validation framework. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The use of optional imports and introspection methods is typical and does not pose a security threat.",
