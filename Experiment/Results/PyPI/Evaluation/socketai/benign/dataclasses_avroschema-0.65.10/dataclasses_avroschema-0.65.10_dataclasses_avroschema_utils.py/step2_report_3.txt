  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a utility module for data modeling, with no evident malicious activity. It performs safe type checks, data normalization, and metadata management.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no external data leaks, no dynamic code execution, and no backdoors. The use of dynamic attribute access and type inspection is standard and safe here.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score aligns with the analysis. The malware score is correctly zero, given no malicious activity. The confidence is high.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on type introspection and schema metadata. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Findings:** No network calls, data leaks, or malicious code. The functions operate on class/type attributes safely.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0, Confidence: 0.95\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the benign nature. The risk score is minimal, and malware score is zero.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on type handling, including recursive data processing, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Findings:** The recursive `standardize_custom_type()` function processes data structures safely. No network or code injection observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1, Confidence: 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The very low risk score and zero malware score are justified. The potential concern about dynamic attribute access is mitigated by the context.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for type inspection and schema management, with no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** Uses standard Python practices, optional dependencies, and safe attribute access.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0, Confidence: 0.95\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar utility functions for type and schema handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No network activity, data leaks, or code injection. The code relies on static introspection.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The low risk and malware scores are justified. Slightly higher risk score may reflect the dynamic attribute access, but in this context, it's safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Presence of issues:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Malware scores:** Correctly set to 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Correctly 0; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, justified by the benign nature of the code.\n- **Confidence levels:** High, given the thorough analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores consistency:** All scores are consistent with the code's benign behavior.\n- **Potential improvements:** None needed; the analysis aligns well with the code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and standard)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, due to dynamic attribute access but within safe bounds)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears to be a standard, safe utility module for data modeling with no security concerns.",
