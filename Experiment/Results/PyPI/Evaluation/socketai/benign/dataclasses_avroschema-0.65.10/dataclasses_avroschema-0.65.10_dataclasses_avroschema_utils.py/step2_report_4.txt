  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code's actual behavior, and then synthesize an overall security stance.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Finds no malicious intent, safe use of dynamic attribute access, no code execution, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** Correct; the code is mainly type introspection and data handling with no evident malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; no malicious activity, standard practices, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** Correct; the code is benign utility functions.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes potential risks from dynamic attribute access and recursive data transformation, but finds no actual malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk due to recursive data handling and use of `getattr`, which could be misused if misapplied externally. However, within this code, it appears safe.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; the risk score is appropriately low, acknowledging potential misuses but not evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes the absence of dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** Correct; the code is standard utility code.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; no malicious behavior, standard practices, no signs of obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk score, perhaps due to the same reasons as Report 3, but still no evidence of actual malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0; the code contains no malicious code, no network activity, no code injection, no backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports are 0; the code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard Python idioms.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are very low (0 to 0.2). The slight elevation in some reports reflects awareness that dynamic attribute access and recursive data handling could be misused if misapplied externally, but in this context, they are safe.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the potential for misuse if the functions are misapplied outside their intended context, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe utility module for type inspection, schema metadata, and data normalization. No malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the consensus and the actual code behavior.",
