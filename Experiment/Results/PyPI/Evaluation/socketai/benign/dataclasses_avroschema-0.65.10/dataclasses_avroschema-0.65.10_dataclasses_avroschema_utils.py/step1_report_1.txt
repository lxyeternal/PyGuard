{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions, data structures, and type checks for a serialization/deserialization framework, likely related to data modeling with pydantic, faust, and typing annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes (e.g., schema_name, schema_doc, default) for creating schema metadata, and also reads type annotations and module attributes for type checking and dynamic behavior.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks that could process untrusted input directly; the code primarily manipulates internal data structures and type information. The standardize_custom_type function processes nested data but does not execute code or evaluate untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Type and attribute checks flow from class and type attribute retrieval into conditional logic; data serialization in standardize_custom_type flows from data inputs (dicts, lists, enums, custom objects) to normalized representations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors detected. The code does include dynamic attribute access and type checks that could be misused if combined with external untrusted data, but there is no evidence of malicious code injection. The presence of optional imports (pydantic, faust) appears safe and conditional.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly comprises utility functions for type introspection, object validation, and data normalization, as well as dataclass definitions for schema and field metadata. It uses standard Python practices with no suspicious code patterns. The functions perform safe operations like attribute retrieval, type checking, and data transformation. No network calls, file I/O, or code execution based on external input is present. The only concern could be the use of dynamic attribute access and type handling which, if misused externally, could lead to security issues, but in this code, they are used safely.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard part of a data modeling or serialization framework with no evident malicious intent. It includes safe type introspection, data transformation, and metadata management. No malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
