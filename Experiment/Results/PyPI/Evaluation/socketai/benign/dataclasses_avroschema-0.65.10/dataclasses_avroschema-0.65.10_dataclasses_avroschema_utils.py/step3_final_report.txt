  "purpose": "Utility module for data modeling, type introspection, and schema metadata management, with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Type inspection functions, class attribute access, recursive data normalization, optional dependency imports.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no external data leaks, network activity, or code execution points.",
  "flows": "Type checks and attribute retrieval flow into data transformation functions, with recursive handling of nested structures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'getattr' for dynamic attribute access; recursive data processing functions. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static type checks, data serialization, and schema metadata management using standard Python idioms. No network calls, code injection, or secret handling are present. Recursive functions process data safely within context. Use of optional dependencies and dynamic attribute access is controlled and typical for such utility modules. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for data modeling and schema handling, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. Security risk is minimal, primarily due to dynamic attribute access, which is safe within this context. Malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.1.",
