  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the code as an __init__ or aggregation module importing classes/constants/functions related to Avro schemas.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies that the code only imports and re-exports symbols, with no runtime data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. These are appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely static, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static import nature.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes the absence of dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or risky behavior detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, focusing on the module's role.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is a standard module aggregator with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with previous reports.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as static import/export logic, with no data flow or security issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Suitable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious or risky behavior.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately describes the code as a benign module setup.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is a straightforward module that imports and re-exports symbols. It does not contain any executable logic, dynamic code, or data handling that could be malicious.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Security Risk:** Zero, as the code is purely structural and static.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, benign module aggregator typical for a Python package's __init__.py or central module. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior.",
