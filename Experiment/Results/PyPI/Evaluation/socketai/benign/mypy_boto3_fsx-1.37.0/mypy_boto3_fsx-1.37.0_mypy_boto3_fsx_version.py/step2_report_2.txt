  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe a minimal, static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No input/output, external data, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- The code is straightforward, typical for Python package versioning.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future year (2025) in the copyright comment, which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n**1. Confirming issues in the code:**\n- The code matches the description: a simple string assignment with no external interactions.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code itself.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- They note the future year as a possible typo but do not treat it as a security concern, which is appropriate.\n- No misinterpretations or logical flaws are evident.\n\n**3. Scores given to each issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0 or 1 (mostly 0)\n  - `confidence`: 1\n- These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n- No issues warrant a higher risk score; the code is purely declarative.\n- The reports' scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**\n- No malicious activity is described or implied.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they correctly state the code is benign.\n- The only questionable point is the future year, which is not a security concern.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as benign. The only minor note is the future year in the comment, which is not a security issue but could be corrected for accuracy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a standard, safe version declaration with no security concerns.",
