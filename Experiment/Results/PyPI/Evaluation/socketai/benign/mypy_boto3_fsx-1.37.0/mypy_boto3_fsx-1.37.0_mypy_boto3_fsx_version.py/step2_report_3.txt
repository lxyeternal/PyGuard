  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a simple assignment of a version string (`\"1.37.0\"`) to the `__version__` variable.\n   - It includes only a comment about the source of truth and a copyright notice.\n   - There are no input/output operations, no external data handling, no network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The code is static, minimal, and typical for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n   - The mention of a future year (2025) in the copyright notice is benign, likely a typo or placeholder.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n   - The reports' confidence levels are all at 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate. There is no evidence of malicious intent or payload.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and readable.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The only minor point is the future year (2025), which might be a typo but does not impact security.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code does not process external data or perform any risky operations.\n\n5. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard version declaration with no signs of malicious activity.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, and the reports correctly reflect that.",
