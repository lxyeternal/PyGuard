  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the underlying code:\n\n**Code Analysis:**\n- The code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- Contains only a comment, a copyright notice, and the version assignment.\n- No input/output, external data, dynamic code, or network activity.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious code.\n\n**Review of Reports:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**\n   - Correctly identifies the code as a straightforward version declaration.\n   - No issues with the logic or security.\n   - Confidence is high; no anomalies.\n   - Malware score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n2. **Report 2:**\n   - Also correctly notes the benign nature.\n   - Mentions the future year (2025) in the copyright—likely a typo, but not malicious.\n   - No security concerns.\n   - Malware score remains 0.\n\n3. **Report 3:**\n   - Similar conclusion; standard version assignment.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n   - Malware score is 0.\n\n4. **Report 4:**\n   - Highlights the same straightforward assignment.\n   - Notes the copyright year inconsistency.\n   - No malicious activity.\n   - Malware score is 0.\n\n5. **Report 5:**\n   - Same assessment; simple static assignment.\n   - No input/output or external interactions.\n   - Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a minimal, standard version declaration.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future year (2025), which is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0 for all, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0, the code poses no security risk.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The current scores are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a typical, benign version declaration with no security concerns.",
