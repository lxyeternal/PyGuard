  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string for source of truth.",
  "sources": "Assignment of '__version__' variable with a string literal.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data or untrusted input processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment with no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Future year '2025' in comment, likely a typo or placeholder; no malicious anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string to '__version__'. It contains only a comment and a copyright notice, with no input/output, dynamic code, or external data handling. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, and confidence=1. The only minor anomaly is the future year, which does not impact security. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
