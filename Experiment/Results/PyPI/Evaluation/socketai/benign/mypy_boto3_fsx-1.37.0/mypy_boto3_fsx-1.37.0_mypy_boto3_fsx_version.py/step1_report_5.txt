  "purpose": "Defines the version string for the package or module.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the __version__ variable with a string value.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flow or untrusted input sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials (beyond version info), or suspicious behaviors. The copyright year appears inconsistent with the code version, but this is likely a benign typo or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment, a copyright notice, and a variable assignment for __version__ with a static string. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no potential sink points. The code appears typical for a version identifier and contains no malicious or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward version declaration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any actions beyond defining a string variable.",
