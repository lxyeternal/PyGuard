  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright year that may be inconsistent with current date, but not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to the __version__ variable and includes a copyright notice. No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a standard practice for Python modules to specify their version.",
