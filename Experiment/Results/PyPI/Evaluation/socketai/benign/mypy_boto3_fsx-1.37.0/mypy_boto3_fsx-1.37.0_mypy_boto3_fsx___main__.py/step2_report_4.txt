  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details.\n- It processes command-line arguments (`sys.argv`) to check for `--version`.\n- It outputs to `sys.stdout` via `sys.stdout.write`.\n- No external data sources, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- No secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n- **Confirmed:** The code is straightforward, benign, and performs only static output based on command-line input.\n- **No issues found** in the code logic or behavior.\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**\n- The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious activity.\n- They correctly identify that the code only outputs static information and checks for a specific argument.\n- **No errors or flaws** are evident in the reasoning.\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0 or 0.0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **No adjustments needed**; the scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is justified.\n- The code does not perform any actions that could introduce security risks.\n- **No justification for higher scores** is necessary.\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Consideration**\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`.\n- This is accurate because:\n  - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n  - No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.\n  - No external data or network activity is involved.\n\n### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- They avoid speculative claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n- The scores are consistent across all reports.\n- Given the code's simplicity and safety, the scores of zero for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n## Final Assessment:\n\n### **Malware Score:** **0**\n- The code is entirely benign; no malicious activity detected.\n\n### **Obfuscated Score:** **0**\n- The code is clear, straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n### **Risk Score:** **0**\n- No security risks are present; the code only outputs static info.\n\n---\n\n## **Overall Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign CLI utility with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as safe.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
