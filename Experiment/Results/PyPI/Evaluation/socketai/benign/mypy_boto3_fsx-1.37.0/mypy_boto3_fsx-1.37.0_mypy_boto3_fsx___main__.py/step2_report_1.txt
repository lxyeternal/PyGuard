  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step and compare them to the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a straightforward CLI utility.\n- It imports sys, checks for \"--version\" in sys.argv.\n- If \"--version\" is present, it outputs \"1.37.0\".\n- Otherwise, it outputs static package info, including links and version details.\n- No external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- The code is simple, with clear control flow, and serves only informational purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. They consistently describe the code as straightforward and safe.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are accurate. They correctly identify that the code only outputs static information based on command-line input, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n  These are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation of Scores and Claims:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct. No malicious payloads or behavior are present.\n\n- **Obfuscated:**  \n  All assign 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security Risk:**  \n  All assign 0, which is justified. The code does not handle sensitive data, perform network operations, or have any vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Confidence Level:**  \n  All reports have high confidence (1.0), which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:\n\n- **Any assumptions or claims?**  \n  All reports avoid assumptions and correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n- **Are any scores higher than justified?**  \n  No. All scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the code and the reports:\n\n- The code does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior.\n- The purpose is purely informational.\n- No external dependencies or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- The code is simple, clean, and safe.\n\n**Therefore, I would assign the following scores:**\n\n| Category        | Score |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| malware         | 0     |\n| obfuscated      | 0     |\n| securityRisk    | 0     |\n\n**Overall, the assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code.**\n\n---\n\n### Final Summary:\n\n- The code is a benign CLI utility with no security issues.\n- The reports correctly identify the code's nature.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's simplicity.",
