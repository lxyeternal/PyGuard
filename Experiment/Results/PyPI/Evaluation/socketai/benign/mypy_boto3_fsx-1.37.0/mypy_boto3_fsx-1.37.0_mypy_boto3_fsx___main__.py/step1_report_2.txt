  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint script for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv (specifically '--version') flows to print_version() and then to stdout; otherwise, info is printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. No obfuscated or malicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and serves only informational output.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for '--version' in command-line arguments and conditionally outputs version info or package info. All data output is static, and no untrusted input influences the behavior beyond the argument check. There are no external data fetches, network activity, or suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be a standard CLI utility with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI entrypoint providing static information about a package. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks identified in this code snippet.",
