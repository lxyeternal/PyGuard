  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about the package, including version details and documentation links.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write outputs data to stdout; no untrusted data sources are used",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) leading to output functions (print_version, print_info)",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors, straightforward control flow",
  "analysis": "The script reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and outputs static information to stdout. No external data sources, no data manipulation, and no dynamic code execution. The output is static and controlled. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads. The code's purpose is solely to display package info and version details.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package information and version details. There are no indicators of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
