  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface that outputs static package information or version details based on user input.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to sys.stdout",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (sys.argv) to output functions (print_info or print_version) to stdout",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static output with no dynamic or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line input. It reads sys.argv to determine if '--version' is present, then outputs either the version number or package info. There are no external data sources, network calls, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or secrets. The control flow is clear and standard, with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent. The code's purpose is purely informational, and it does not handle sensitive data or perform any operations that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and serves only to display static information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and justified.",
