  "purpose": "CLI script providing package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv; outputs package info and version to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument as a source, then directs flow to print version or package info, which are outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution. Uses only standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward CLI operations: it reads command-line input and outputs static information. There are no inputs from untrusted sources beyond command-line args, and outputs are only informational. No network operations, no file manipulations, no secret handling, and no obfuscated logic. The code structure is simple and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package info and version. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. It is safe and straightforward.",
