  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review**:\n   - The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n   - It reads `sys.argv` to check for `--version`.\n   - It writes output to `sys.stdout`.\n   - No dynamic data, external data sources, network activity, or user input beyond the command-line argument.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns.\n   - The functions are simple, and control flow is clear.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity**:\n   - All reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and solely informational.\n   - They identify no suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no secrets, and no malicious payloads.\n   - The analysis aligns with the code content.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - **Malware Score**:\n     - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**:\n     - All reports assign 0 or 0.0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n   - **Security Risk Score**:\n     - All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are reported or detected.\n   - The code is simple and safe; no reason to adjust scores.\n\n5. **Final Justification**:\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The confidence is high (1.0) in all reports, which is justified.\n\n6. **My Own Estimate**:\n   - Based on the code and reports, I concur with the provided scores.\n   - **Malware score**: 0\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0\n   - **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a benign CLI utility with no malicious intent.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- Confirm that the scores remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n- The code poses no security threat based on current analysis.",
