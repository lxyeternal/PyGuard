{
  "purpose": "Define detailed type annotations for various FSx service data structures to facilitate type-safe API interactions and data handling.",
  "sources": "Reading of imported modules, type definitions, and constants; access to module attributes; type annotations for dicts, lists, and other data structures.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage via string or list data; no direct data sinks like network connections, file writes, or eval calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows are primarily confined within type definitions, describing data structures; no executable data flow or untrusted input handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic; purely declarative type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of type definitions using TypedDict, Union, and Literal to specify data schemas for FSx SDK responses and requests. It imports standard and extension modules for typing, and defines numerous data structures reflecting the FSx API. No runtime logic, data processing, network communication, or code execution occurs. The code is well-structured, adheres to standard typing practices, and contains no signs of malicious activity. Its sole purpose is to facilitate static type checking and documentation for FSx API data structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of type annotations and data schemas for FSx SDK interactions. It contains no executable logic or network activity and shows no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code appears safe, intended solely for type safety and documentation.",
