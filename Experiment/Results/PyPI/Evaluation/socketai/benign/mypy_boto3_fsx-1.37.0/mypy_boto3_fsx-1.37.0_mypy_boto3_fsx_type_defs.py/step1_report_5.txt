{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for fsx service data structures to facilitate type checking and improve code clarity.",
  "sources": "Reads from external modules (.literals), standard libraries (sys, datetime, typing), and within the file via class and variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code primarily defines data types and does not perform data handling or processing actions.",
  "flows": "Type definitions and annotations are static; no runtime data flow or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic observed. No suspicious data leakage or privacy violations. Usage of standard type annotations and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive collection of TypedDict class definitions, type aliases, and Union types to specify data structures for AWS FSx service interactions. It employs conditional imports based on Python version to maintain compatibility, and it strictly adheres to type annotation standards without executing or manipulating data at runtime. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be auto-generated or structured as a schema for type safety and documentation purposes. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are detected. Overall, the code is a safe, static definition module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-executable, static set of type definitions for AWS FSx SDK. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is used solely for type checking and clarity in codebases that interact with FSx services.",
