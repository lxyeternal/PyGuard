  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a large collection of static type definitions, primarily using TypedDict, Union, and Literal to model AWS FSx API request and response data structures.\n- They emphasize that the code is purely declarative, with no executable logic, data processing, or runtime data handling.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The purpose is for static type checking, documentation, and API schema enforcement.\n- Confidence in these assessments is 1, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- The code contains only static type definitions; no runtime logic, no data processing, no external I/O beyond type annotations.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- Conditional imports based on Python version are standard for compatibility.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious code are present.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as purely declarative.\n- No logical errors or inconsistencies are evident.\n- The type annotations and structure definitions are comprehensive and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:** No logical flaws or mistakes.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- The purpose and analysis align with the static, safe nature of the code.\n- No adjustments needed; scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- All scores are 0, which is justified given the static, non-executable nature.\n- No reason to elevate risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score:\n- The code is purely type definitions with no runtime or external interactions.\n- No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n### Obfuscated score:\n- No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward type annotations.\n- Obfuscated score remains at 0.\n\n### Security risk:\n- No evident vulnerabilities, secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- Security risk remains at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as static type definitions, not involving untrusted data or dynamic code.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are necessary; the static nature makes the code inherently safe.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All assessments are consistent with the static, safe nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign, well-structured set of static type definitions for AWS FSx SDK.**\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate after thorough review:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| 0 | 0 | 0 |\n\n**Justification:**  \n- No executable code, no runtime logic, no external data handling.  \n- Static type annotations only.  \n- No suspicious patterns or malicious intent.  \n- All evidence supports a safe, purely declarative schema module.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate. The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It serves solely for type safety and API schema validation.",
