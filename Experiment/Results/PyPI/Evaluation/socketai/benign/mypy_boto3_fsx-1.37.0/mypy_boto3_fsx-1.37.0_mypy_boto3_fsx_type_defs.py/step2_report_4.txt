  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the details provided and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely static type definitions for FSx service entities, with no runtime logic or data processing. It notes the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code consists solely of TypedDict, Union, and Literal annotations, used for static type checking. No executable code, data flow, or external I/O is present. The use of conditional imports for Python version compatibility is standard practice.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** The report assigns malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, purely declarative, and intended for type safety and API schema validation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a comprehensive set of type annotations for FSx, with no executable logic or malicious patterns. It highlights the extensive use of TypedDicts and Union types.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is static, with no runtime behavior. The use of conditional imports based on Python version is standard for compatibility.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Scores of 0 are justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign, purely for static analysis and documentation purposes.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report notes that the code defines data structures for FSx, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It mentions the extensive use of TypedDict and type annotations, with no dynamic code or external data handling.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is entirely declarative, modeling API request and response schemas. No runtime or executable logic is present.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Zero scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, intended solely for static type checking.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the focus is on the static, declarative nature of the code. It emphasizes the absence of untrusted data handling, dynamic execution, or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a schema of data models, with no executable or data-processing code.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Scores of 0 are justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign and purely for type safety.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report confirms that the code is a static collection of type definitions for AWS FSx SDK, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is consistent with auto-generated SDK type stubs, designed for static analysis and IDE support.\n\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Zero scores are appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code is safe, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Synthesis:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify any issues with the code. All agree that it is purely declarative, static type definitions with no executable or malicious code.\n\n- **Scores Justification:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 across all reports, as no malicious patterns are present.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0, since the code is straightforward type annotations.\n  - **Risk:** 0, given the absence of executable logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n\n- **Additional Justification:** The code is typical of auto-generated SDK stubs, which are safe and serve as static type hints for IDEs and static analyzers.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0.0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.0** — Clear, straightforward type annotations.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.0** — No security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is entirely benign, static, and intended for type checking and API schema validation.
