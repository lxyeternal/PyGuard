{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and data structures for FSx service type definitions in Python, primarily for static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, typing, and local module literals; class and variable definitions including TypedDicts, Unions, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution functions; primarily data structure definitions with no data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code strictly defines data types and structures without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be purely declarative with extensive type annotations, interface definitions, and no executable logic, scripts, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of TypedDict and Union definitions for various FSx service components, including configurations, responses, requests, and metadata. It uses conditional imports based on Python version, employs standard type annotations, and references external literals. The absence of any executable code, data handling, or external network interactions suggests it is purely for type hinting and static analysis purposes. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detectable within this static definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a large schema of type definitions for FSx service interactions, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a benign, well-structured, purely declarative module intended for static type checking and documentation.",
