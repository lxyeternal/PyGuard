  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Summary of findings from reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a static, comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS FSx SDK interactions.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or external data handling is present.\n- The code employs standard typing practices: TypedDict, Union, Literal, conditional imports based on Python version.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are identified.\n- The purpose is clearly to facilitate static type checking, API schema validation, and documentation.\n- Confidence levels are all at 1, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The code contains no runtime logic, no data flows involving untrusted sources, and no external I/O beyond type annotations.\n- The extensive use of type annotations and data schemas aligns with best practices for SDK stub generation.\n- The conditional imports for Python version compatibility are standard and safe.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or signs of malicious intent are evident.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is clear, declarative, and well-structured.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — Purely static type definitions, no runtime or external interaction that could pose a security risk.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a well-structured, purely declarative set of type definitions for AWS FSx SDK, used for static analysis, type safety, and documentation.\n- It is safe, non-obfuscated, and free from malware or malicious patterns.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- The current scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and reasonable.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is benign, intended solely for static type checking, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. It is safe and well-structured.",
