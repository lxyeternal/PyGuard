{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type definitions for AWS FSx service data structures, request and response schemas, and related configurations, primarily for static type checking, documentation, and API validation.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and data structure definitions, including TypedDict, Union, and Literal, used for modeling API schemas without runtime data handling.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data sources or untrusted data inputs; no external I/O or dynamic code execution; purely static type definitions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only defines data schemas and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type definitions using Python's typing system, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It models AWS FSx API request and response structures, employing TypedDict, Union, and Literal. No executable logic, data processing, or external data handling exists. The code is typical of SDK stub files, intended for static analysis, IDE support, and documentation. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of static type definitions for AWS FSx SDK, serving purely for type safety and API schema validation. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements.",
