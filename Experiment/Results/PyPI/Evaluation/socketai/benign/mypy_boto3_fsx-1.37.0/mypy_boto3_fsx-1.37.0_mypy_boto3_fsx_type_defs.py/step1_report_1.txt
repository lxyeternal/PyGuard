  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for FSx service type definitions, used for type checking and API contract enforcement.",
  "sources": "No direct data input sources; these are static type definitions and class annotations intended for API schema modeling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; code consists solely of TypedDict and Union class definitions, with no runtime data processing or external I/O.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing logic; the code only declares data schemas without executable flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, dynamic code execution, or runtime data handling; all constructs are static type definitions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides comprehensive type definitions for FSx service entities, including request and response data structures, all implemented as TypedDict or Union types. It employs conditional imports based on Python version for type hinting compatibility. There are no functions, no runtime logic, and no dynamic code execution. All type annotations are static and serve to enforce API schema correctness during development or static analysis. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident. The code appears to be purely declarative, with the intent to facilitate type safety and API contract validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-executable, purely declarative set of type definitions for AWS FSx service. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. It is safe and intended solely for type checking and schema validation purposes.",
