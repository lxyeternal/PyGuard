{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations and data structures for AWS FSx service SDK, specifically for use with boto3 stubs, providing type safety and clarity for API interactions.",
  "sources": "The code primarily sources data from function parameters, external type literals, and AWS service responses, with no evident untrusted input handling. It imports sys for version checks and predefined type literals.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of input parameters in function signatures, environment variables, or external data, but none are explicitly shown. The code constructs typed dictionaries and data models, which are safe by design.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (such as ResourceARN, FileSystemId, etc.) into typed dictionaries that define API requests and responses. No dynamic execution or untrusted data manipulation is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code strictly defines data models, uses safe type annotations, and employs version checks for importing typing modules. No obfuscated code or malicious constructs are identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for a Python SDK interacting with AWS FSx. It uses TypedDict, Union, and type literals to model API request and response structures. The use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard. No signs of code injection, unsafe data handling, or malicious behavior are detected. The code is purely declarative, focusing on data modeling without execution logic or external data processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, well-structured set of type annotations and data models for AWS FSx SDK. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations. Its purpose is to provide type safety and clarity for SDK users.",
