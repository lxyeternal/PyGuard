  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging mypy-boto3-fsx, defining package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; no data leaks or network calls.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from local file and hardcoded strings into setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup script that reads a local README.md for description and supplies fixed metadata to setuptools.setup(). No dynamic inputs, external data, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code detected. The code's purpose is to configure package installation; it does not perform any runtime operations beyond reading a local file. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All signals indicate safe, well-understood packaging practices.",
