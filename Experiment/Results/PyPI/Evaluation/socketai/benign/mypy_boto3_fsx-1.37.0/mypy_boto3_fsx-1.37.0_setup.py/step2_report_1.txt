  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll five reports describe the same code—a standard Python setup script for the package `mypy-boto3-fsx`. Each report concludes that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code reads a local README.md file for the long description and passes static metadata to `setuptools.setup()`. No untrusted inputs, external network calls, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code Presence:** The code matches the description; it is a typical setup script.\n- **Malicious Behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security Risks:** None detected.\n- **Malware:** None detected.\n- **Data flows:** Static, with no untrusted data or external inputs.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent; the code is straightforward and standard.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning are evident.\n- The code's purpose and behavior are well-understood and align with common packaging practices.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0, consistent with the absence of security issues.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- The reports are uniform and accurate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a typical, static setup script with no dynamic or malicious elements. The reading of a local README.md file is standard practice, and no external data or untrusted inputs are involved. All indicators point to a safe, benign package configuration script.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis supply chain report accurately assesses the code as benign. No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary. The code poses no security threat and follows standard practices.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores and conclusions. The code is safe and free from malicious or obfuscated content.",
