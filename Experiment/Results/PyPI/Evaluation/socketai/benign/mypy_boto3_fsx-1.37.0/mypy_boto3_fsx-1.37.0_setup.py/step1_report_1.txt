  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-fsx package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of the README.md file for the long description; gathers package metadata and dependencies from static strings and file content.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output to external systems; setup parameters are static or derived from local files.",
  "flows": "Reads file content for long_description, then passes static data to setup(). No dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. No use of untrusted input, no code injection, and no obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and setuptools for package setup. It reads the README.md file for the long description, which is standard practice. The setup() function is called with static package metadata, dependencies, URLs, and classifiers. No dynamic or user input data is processed. No external network calls or sensitive data handling occurs. The code appears to be a typical, benign setup script for Python packaging without malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script used for packaging a Python library. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. The script solely manages package metadata and dependencies in a conventional manner.",
