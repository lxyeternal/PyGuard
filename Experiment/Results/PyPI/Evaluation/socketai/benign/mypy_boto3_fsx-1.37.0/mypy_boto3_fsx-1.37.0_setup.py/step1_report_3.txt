  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-fsx package to configure package installation and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file for long_description; importing setup from setuptools; hardcoded package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or user inputs; no data leakage or external connections.",
  "flows": "No external data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static package configuration with no dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or hidden behaviors detected. The script performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports standard modules and calls setup() with static, well-known parameters. No input validation, no code execution based on external input, and no network activity or environment variable use. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical package setup conventions. No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs expected package configuration tasks without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
