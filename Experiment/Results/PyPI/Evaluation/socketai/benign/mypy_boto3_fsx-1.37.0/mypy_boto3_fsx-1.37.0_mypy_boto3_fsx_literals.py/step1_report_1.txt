{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various FSx service-related string constants to be used with type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions; hardcoded string literals in variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted input handling, data output, or network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to critical sinks; only static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Usage of conditional import based on Python version is standard. The code is purely declarative with no executable logic or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily provides string literal type definitions for use elsewhere, with a conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version. There are no functions, no data processing, no external data inputs, nor any code execution or network activity. The licensing and documentation comments are benign. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static type declaration module that defines string literals for various constants related to the FSx service. It does not perform any operations, data handling, or network communication, and there are no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
