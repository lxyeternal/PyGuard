  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS FSx service parameters and other AWS services for type checking in Python.",
  "sources": "Type annotations for AWS FSx and other AWS service literals, imported conditionally based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data input or output handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code primarily consists of static literal definitions and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version, which is standard practice. It then defines multiple type aliases as string Literal types for AWS service parameters, including FSx-specific types, resource names, regions, etc. All definitions are static and do not execute any runtime logic or data handling. There are no external inputs, network activity, or executable payloads. The purpose appears solely to provide type hints for static analysis tools. No signs of obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for static type checking, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It contains no dynamic or unsafe code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It serves as a type annotation module for AWS SDK usage.",
