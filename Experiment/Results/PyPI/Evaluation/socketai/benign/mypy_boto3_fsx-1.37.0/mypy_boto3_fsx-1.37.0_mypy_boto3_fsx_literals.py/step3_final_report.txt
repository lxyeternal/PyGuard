{
  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for AWS FSx service constants and related AWS resource identifiers, serving as static type annotations for SDKs or documentation.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; static constants only, no runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard conditional import for compatibility; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using Literal, with conditional import for Python version compatibility. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or network activity. The purpose is to facilitate type checking and documentation for AWS SDKs. No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and intended solely for type annotations. There are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The minimal risk score assigned in the original reports (0.1 in report 4) is unwarranted; a score of 0 is more appropriate across all reports.",
