{
  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for various AWS FSx service parameters and other AWS service identifiers to facilitate type annotations and validation in Python code.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, and typing_extensions; string literals assigned to variables for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external data handling, or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only establishes static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic. The code is purely declarative for type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions using Literal types for AWS service parameters. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is a standard practice for compatibility. No input handling, data processing, or external communication occurs. The content is static and intended for type checking. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden functionalities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions for AWS FSx and other AWS services, serving as a type safety aid. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign and purely for development tooling.",
