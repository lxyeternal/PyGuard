  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, potential security issues, or signs of malicious activity.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is purely static, defining string literal types for AWS FSx and other AWS service constants.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or external data input/output.\n- Conditional import of 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' based on Python version is standard.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious payloads.\n- No network activity, file I/O, or runtime logic.\n- The purpose is for type safety and documentation, which is typical for SDK or API client libraries.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across all reports. No malicious activity is indicated.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 or very close to 0, with no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- **Anomalies or Suspicious Behavior:** None detected; the code is static and declarative.\n\n**Potential concerns or points of clarification:**\n\n- The only minor anomaly is the conditional import for 'Literal', which is a common pattern for compatibility and not suspicious.\n- The code does not perform any operations, so it cannot be exploited or used maliciously on its own.\n- The purpose is to aid static type checking, which is benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports agree that this is a benign, static type declaration module with no security issues, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no operational or security risk.\n\nThis module is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS SDKs, with no indication of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n**Final note:** No changes needed to the reported scores or conclusions. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
