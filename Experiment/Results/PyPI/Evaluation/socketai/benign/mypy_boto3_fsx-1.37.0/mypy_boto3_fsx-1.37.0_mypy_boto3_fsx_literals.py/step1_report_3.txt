{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS FSx service and related AWS services, regions, and paginator names for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module; conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions; definitions of string literal types with hardcoded string values.",
  "sinks": "None. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily defines type annotations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable. This module only defines constants and types without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. Code consists of static string literals and type annotations only; no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for various AWS FSx and related resource literals, with conditional import to support Python versions prior to 3.12. It uses Literal types to restrict values to predefined strings for better type safety and documentation. There are no runtime computations, data processing, or external interactions. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward and intended for type hinting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, type annotation module defining string literal types for AWS SDK usage. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. No suspicious activity or malware indicators are present.",
