{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS FSx service string constants and related resources to enable type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "All literal definitions and the import statement for 'sys'.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code only defines type aliases without data processing or untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow or input/output operations; solely type annotations and static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, or obfuscated code. The only noteworthy aspect is the conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of type alias definitions using 'Literal' for AWS FSx-related constants, with conditional import to maintain compatibility with older Python versions. No input reading, network communication, or data handling is present. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code is purely declarative and static, serving as a type interface for other code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS service constants. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are evident. It appears to be a standard, open-source type definition file with no signs of sabotage.",
