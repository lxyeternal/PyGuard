  "purpose": "Define paginators for the AWS FSx service client with type annotations for better static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type definitions, and method signatures for paginate functions, including the use of type definitions from '.type_defs'.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods that accept arbitrary keyword arguments and return PageIterator objects. No direct untrusted data processing or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "Not explicitly applicable; the code sets up class structures and method signatures without processing or passing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code consists mainly of class definitions, type annotations, and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for the FSx AWS service, inheriting from generic Paginator classes and overriding 'paginate' methods with specific type annotations. It conditionally imports 'Unpack' based on Python version, which is a standard compatibility pattern. The 'paginate' methods only declare signature and docstrings, with no embedded logic or external data handling. No obfuscated code, malicious instructions, or suspicious behaviors are identified. The overall structure is consistent with standard AWS SDK stub patterns and static typing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of class definitions for AWS SDK paginators with type annotations, intended to enhance static analysis and IDE features. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this module.",
