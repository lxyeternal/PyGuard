  "purpose": "Defines type-safe paginator classes for the FSx service client, providing structured pagination support with type annotations.",
  "sources": "The 'paginate' methods accept **kwargs** which are passed to the underlying boto3 paginator methods.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods pass untrusted kwargs directly to boto3's paginator, which could be misused if untrusted input is provided, but this is standard SDK behavior.",
  "flows": "Source: **kwargs** in 'paginate' methods; Sink: passing kwargs to boto3 paginator methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code is boilerplate for static typing support.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for paginators with type annotations, conditional imports for compatibility, and documentation links. No dynamic code execution, external data leaks, or obfuscated code are present. The use of **kwargs** is standard in SDK wrappers and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward, serving as static support for boto3's paginators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK boilerplate with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated content. The scores should be malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to passing kwargs but no actual security concerns.",
