  "purpose": "Define typed paginator classes for the FSx service client to facilitate pagination of various API calls in a type-safe manner.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class method parameters via **kwargs with Unpack.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods accept untrusted input via **kwargs, which are passed to the underlying paginator's 'paginate' method.",
  "flows": "Input data (kwargs) flows from 'paginate' method parameters into the underlying Paginator's 'paginate' method, potentially affecting data returned to callers.",
  "anomalies": "The code is primarily boilerplate class definitions with type annotations; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs observed. The use of type hints and conditional imports is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with method 'paginate' that accept flexible kwargs unpacked into type-defined request parameters, and return PageIterator objects. There is careful handling of type checking via 'TYPE_CHECKING' and version-specific imports. No dynamic code execution, data leaks, network connections, or suspicious behaviors are present. All components appear standard and intended for proper SDK usage. The code is consistent, well-structured, and adheres to typical type-safe SDK patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard SDK boilerplate for paginators with proper type annotations. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It facilitates pagination with no evident security concerns or backdoors.",
