  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for the AWS FSx service client in boto3, enabling typed pagination over various FSx resources.",
  "sources": "Code reads type definitions from 'type_defs' module, and interacts with boto3 paginators. No external untrusted input is read within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "Paginator.paginate methods accept kwargs unpacked from type definitions, which are likely used for request parameters; no direct data sinks or untrusted data processing evident.",
  "flows": "Type definitions flow into paginate method parameters; paginator objects invoke paginate with these parameters, with no evidence of data flow from external sources within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and consistent with standard boto3 paginator implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for AWS FSx, utilizing type annotations for request and response types. It conditionally imports 'Unpack' for Python >=3.12, but otherwise uses 'typing_extensions'. The paginator classes inherit from generic Paginator, overriding 'paginate' to accept parameters unpacked from specific request type definitions. All classes are documented with links to boto3 and stub documentation. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or security misuses; the code is static, documentation-oriented, and primarily focuses on type safety and structured access to boto3 paginator methods.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, type-safe wrapper for boto3 FSx paginators with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be well-constructed for type annotations and documentation purposes, with no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
