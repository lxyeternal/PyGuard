  "purpose": "Provides a main interface and documentation for the fsx service, including imports and type definitions.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator). No external data sources or untrusted input handling present.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; only internal imports and assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward, mainly setup and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports local modules, defines a client alias, and specifies an export list. It contains documentation with example usage. There are no external input sources, no execution of dynamic code, no hardcoded credentials, or other suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard module setup for a Python SDK interface with no malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured interface module for fsx service. No malicious behavior, no malware, and no security risks detected.",
