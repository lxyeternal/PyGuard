{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for AWS FSx service, importing client and paginator classes, and exporting them for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator), documentation string, and the module's own definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external outputs beyond module exports.",
  "flows": "Import statements and module exports; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with a future-dated copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports classes and functions related to AWS FSx, sets up an alias, and defines an export list. It contains documentation with usage examples. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing is present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is benign and purely structural, serving as an SDK interface. The future-dated copyright is noted but not problematic. All signals indicate no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions solely as an interface module for AWS FSx SDK components. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
