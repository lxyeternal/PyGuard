  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, consisting of imports, class definitions, documentation, and module exports.\n- No external data sources, user input, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The copyright date is 2025, which is future-dated but not inherently malicious.\n- The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or contain any sink points.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**Security Risk Scores:**\n- All reports assign securityRisk = 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- The code is purely an interface module with no processing logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n- The consistent assessment across reports indicates a solid understanding.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are evident.\n- The code does not warrant a higher malware or risk score.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores across all reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the thorough analysis and the reports' conclusions.\n\n**Final note:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. No adjustments needed.",
