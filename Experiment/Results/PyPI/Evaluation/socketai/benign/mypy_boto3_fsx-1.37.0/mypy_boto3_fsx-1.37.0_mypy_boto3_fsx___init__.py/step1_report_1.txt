  "purpose": "Provides the main interface for the fsx service, including imports and exposing classes and paginators for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports modules and defines constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are detected. The copyright year is 2025, which is in the future but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing classes and defining an API surface. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling. It appears to be a standard module setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign interface setup for the fsx service, with no signs of malware or security risks. It primarily consists of imports and module exports with no malicious intent.",
