{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for the FSx service, importing classes and functions for interacting with AWS FSx via boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), and standard library (__all__). No external data input or environment variables are read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; code primarily imports and defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code does not process user input or external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The comment mentions copyright year 2025, which is future-dated but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes and functions related to the FSx service and defines an alias and an export list. It includes documentation and an example usage. There are no dynamic code execution, environment variable reads, or external data handling. No suspicious patterns or malicious code indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple interface module for AWS FSx, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is a benign, well-structured import/export setup with no signs of malware or security threats.",
