  "purpose": "Type annotations and SDK stub for AWS FSx client, providing method signatures, properties, and exception classes for static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Imports of type definitions, method signatures with kwargs unpacking, exception class definitions, and property methods.",
  "sinks": "Unpacking of kwargs into request type definitions; no runtime data processing or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Method calls unpack kwargs into predefined request types; no dynamic or external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated SDK interface with extensive type annotations. It uses kwargs unpacking for request parameters, which is standard for SDK stubs. There is no runtime logic, network activity, or data leaks. The absence of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors indicates a benign purpose. The minimal risk score reflects the potential for misuse of kwargs if external untrusted data is passed, but this is inherent to SDK design and not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard SDK stub for AWS FSx with no signs of sabotage, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with its static, interface-only nature, and no further security action is necessary.",
