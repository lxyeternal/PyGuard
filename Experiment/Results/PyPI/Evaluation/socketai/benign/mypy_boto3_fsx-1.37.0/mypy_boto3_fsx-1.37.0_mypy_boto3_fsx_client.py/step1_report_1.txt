{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for AWS FSx service, providing type hints and method signatures for SDK usage.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class method parameters and properties.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters with **kwargs unpacked from type definitions; generate_presigned_url parameters; tagging/untagging resource methods.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input via **kwargs is unpacked into method calls, and some parameters like ClientMethod, Params, HttpMethod are used in generate_presigned_url, potentially influenced by external data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. Code follows typical SDK stub patterns; no unusual or obfuscated code present. No network activity, file modifications, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured client interface for AWS FSx with detailed type annotations and method signatures. It imports standard and third-party libraries appropriately, with conditional imports based on Python version. No suspicious behavior, hidden code, or malicious logic detected. The unpacking of kwargs into API calls is standard for SDKs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code were found. The overall design aligns with typical SDK stub files, focused solely on type safety and API structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK stub with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It solely provides type annotations and method signatures for the FSx client, with no suspicious or harmful logic present.",
