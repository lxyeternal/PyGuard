{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for making HTTP requests to the Sailthru API, including data flattening and request handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the function arguments 'data', 'headers', 'file_data', and URL parameter.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can be sent via the 'data' and 'headers' parameters in the HTTP request; response handling occurs but does not write or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into the request, potentially including user-controlled 'headers' and 'data'. The data is flattened and sent via the 'requests' library, and the response is wrapped into a SailthruResponse object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no unusual dynamic code execution. The only potential concern is the use of user-provided 'headers' without validation, but this is typical for request customization.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data flattening for API requests, ensuring nested structures are converted to key-value pairs suitable for URL-encoded forms. It constructs headers, including a fixed 'User-Agent', and combines user-provided headers with default ones. HTTP requests are made via the 'requests' library, with exception handling converting network errors into custom exceptions. No malicious or suspicious code, such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft, is present. The request parameters are derived directly from input arguments, which could be manipulated but are expected in typical API client behavior. Overall, the implementation appears standard and does not exhibit malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an HTTP client wrapper for the Sailthru API, with standard data handling and request logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The only potential concern is unvalidated headers, which is typical in request customization but not inherently malicious.",
