{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for flattening nested dictionaries and performing HTTP requests to the Sailthru API, with error handling and response wrapping.",
  "sources": "Input data 'data', optional 'headers', and 'file_data' for file uploads.",
  "sinks": "Network request via 'requests.request' with untrusted 'data' and 'headers'.",
  "flows": "Input data and headers flow into the 'requests.request' call, with headers potentially extended with default headers.",
  "anomalies": "Headers are extended directly without copying, which could mutate caller data; exception handling for 'requests.HTTPError' is ineffective unless 'raise_for_status()' is called.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data flattening and HTTP request operations with proper error handling. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present. The header extension logic may unintentionally mutate input headers, and the exception handling for HTTP errors is flawed because 'requests.request' does not raise 'HTTPError' unless explicitly invoked via 'raise_for_status()'. These are functional issues but do not indicate malicious intent. The overall behavior is typical for an API client, with no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The untrusted data usage is standard, and no suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API utility module performing data flattening and network requests. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. Minor functional issues exist but do not impact security. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score remains at 0.",
