{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for flattening nested data structures and performing HTTP requests to the Sailthru API",
  "sources": "Data input to 'flatten_nested_hash' and 'sailthru_http_request' functions, especially 'data', 'headers', 'file_data'",
  "sinks": "HTTP request via 'requests.request' using untrusted input data, headers, or files; response handling via 'SailthruResponse'",
  "flows": "Input data and headers flow into 'flatten_nested_hash' and 'sailthru_http_request', which then use 'requests.request' to send network data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code patterns; proper use of try-except blocks; no obfuscation or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data flattening and HTTP requests to an external API. It constructs headers dynamically and allows for untrusted data to be sent over the network. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. Error handling is appropriate. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code follows standard practices and only interacts with external requests within expected bounds.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for API communication, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It handles data sanitization and network requests responsibly, with proper error handling. There are no signs of malware or supply chain attacks.",
