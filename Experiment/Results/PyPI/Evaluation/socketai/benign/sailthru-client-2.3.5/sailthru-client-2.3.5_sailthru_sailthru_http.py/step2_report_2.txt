  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets. The code performs standard data flattening and HTTP requests with proper error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** The logic is sound, and no suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard API client functions. Slight concern about unvalidated headers, but this is typical in API clients.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; the code is straightforward.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard utility functions, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem justified.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard API client code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are consistent.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others, standard functions, no malicious signals.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, indicating no malicious activity detected. This aligns with the code's functionality.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated at 0.1-0.2, reflecting typical API client usage without evident vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code performs data flattening and network requests with proper exception handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The network activity is standard for an API client.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- The untrusted data handling is typical and does not suggest malicious intent.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to potential misuse of unvalidated headers, but this is common in API clients and not inherently malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, with no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware/obfuscated scores should remain at zero.",
