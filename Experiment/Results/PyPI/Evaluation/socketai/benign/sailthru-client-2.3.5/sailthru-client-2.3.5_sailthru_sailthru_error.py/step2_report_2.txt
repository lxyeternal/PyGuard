  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:  \nAll reports describe the code as a simple class definition inheriting from Exception, with no data processing, input/output, or complex logic. This matches the original code provided, which is just a class declaration.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no suspicious or malicious features.  \n- No sources, sinks, or data flows are present, consistent with the code snippet.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.  \n- They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.  \n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n4. **Scores Review**:  \n- All reports assign confidence = 1, obfuscated = 0, malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.  \n- These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.  \n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n- Since the code is just a class definition with no malicious features, the risk score should remain at 0.  \n- The malware score is correctly set to 0, reflecting no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n- The reports correctly assign malware = 0, consistent with the code's nature.  \n- No suspicious behavior or code patterns are present.\n\n7. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n- The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.  \n- No unwarranted security concerns are raised.\n\n8. **Score Consistency**:  \n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class.  \n- The scores are appropriate and justified.  \n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores reflect this accurately.",
