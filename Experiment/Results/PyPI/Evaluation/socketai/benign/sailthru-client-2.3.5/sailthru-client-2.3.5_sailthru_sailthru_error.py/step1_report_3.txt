  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to Sailthru client operations.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths as there are no operational code or data processing statements.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; the class is a straightforward exception subclass with no additional logic. No anomalies or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple class definition for a custom exception, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. It contains no methods, attributes, or complex logic. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The minimal code indicates it's likely part of a larger codebase to handle specific error types related to Sailthru integrations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard custom exception class with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is a benign, straightforward class definition.",
