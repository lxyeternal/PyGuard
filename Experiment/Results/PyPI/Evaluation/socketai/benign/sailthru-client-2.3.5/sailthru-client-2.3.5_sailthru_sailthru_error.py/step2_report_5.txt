  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Presence and Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition inheriting from Exception.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and serves as a custom exception class.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:\n   - There are no logical errors or flaws in the code.\n   - The reports correctly note the absence of anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscation.\n   - No mistakes in reasoning are apparent.\n\n3. **Score Justification and Adjustments**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the code's simplicity.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No claims of vulnerabilities are made; the reasoning dismisses any suspicion.\n   - The code does not contain any malicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - The conclusions are justified based on the code's content.\n\n**Summary of my assessment**:\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or security issues.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should be 0.\n- The security risk score should be 0.\n- The overall risk is negligible.\n\n**Final estimated scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
