{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling specific errors related to Sailthru client operations.",
  "sources": "No data inputs or external data sources; the code is a class definition with no data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the class is a simple inheritance with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single class inheriting from Exception, serving as a custom error type. It contains no data handling, no external interactions, and no complex logic. The code is minimal and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's content. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
