  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named SailthruClientError for handling specific client errors related to Sailthru integration or usage.",
  "sources": "No data sources or input reading; the code only defines a class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling occurs; there is no data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as the code only defines an exception class without any execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and minimal; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines a custom exception class inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. There are no data inputs, external calls, or suspicious behaviors. The class is likely intended for clearer exception handling in a larger codebase. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic class definition for a custom exception with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It serves as part of a larger application for handling specific errors.",
