  "purpose": "API response handler that parses JSON content, manages errors, and reads rate limit headers.",
  "sources": "response.content, response.headers",
  "sinks": "json.loads, response.headers access",
  "flows": "response.content -> json.loads -> self.json; response.headers -> get_rate_limit_headers",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward JSON parsing and header access.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API response wrapper that safely parses JSON, handles JSON errors, and reads specific headers. It does not perform any dangerous operations, code injection, or data exfiltration. The error handling is appropriate, though the 'is_ok' method could be slightly more robust by checking key presence rather than set equality. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API response handler with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate; minor improvements could be made for robustness but are not necessary.",
