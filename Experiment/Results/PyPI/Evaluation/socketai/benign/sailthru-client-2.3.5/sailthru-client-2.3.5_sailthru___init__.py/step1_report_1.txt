  "purpose": "To provide Python bindings for the Sailthru API, facilitating interaction with Sailthru services.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .sailthru_client, .sailthru_error, .sailthru_response",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or security-critical operations are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable as this code only includes import statements and metadata definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior observed. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and module metadata such as author, documentation, copyright, license, and version. It does not perform any data processing, external network access, or system modifications. There are no apparent source-to-sink flows, and the code appears straightforward and standard for a Python package's initial module. The imported modules are local (relative imports), indicating internal structure. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard module setup with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It mainly declares metadata and imports internal components necessary for the package functionality.",
