  "purpose": "Unit testing for sailthru_client functions, including signature generation, parameter extraction, and HTTP response handling.",
  "sources": "Test data variables, mock HTTP responses, signature functions.",
  "sinks": "None; data flows are within controlled test environment.",
  "flows": "Test inputs -> mock responses -> function calls -> assertions.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual sys.path modification (`sys.path[0:0] = ['']`), but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite employing mocks to simulate HTTP responses and signature computations. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets beyond test credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The sys.path modification is unconventional but benign. The test secrets are typical for testing environments. The overall structure and content indicate a benign testing script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit testing suite with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor anomalies are typical in test setups and do not indicate security issues.",
