{
  "purpose": "The code defines a base class for unit tests, with no specific testing logic implemented.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'unittest2' or 'unittest', and class attribute 'maxDiff'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data output points.",
  "flows": "Import statements lead to class definition; no data flow involving untrusted input or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or dynamic code execution. The 'maxDiff' value is unusually large but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'unittest2' with a fallback to 'unittest', which is common for compatibility. It then defines a test base class with a large 'maxDiff' value. There are no functions, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity detected. The structure is straightforward and aligns with standard testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test base class setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
