  "purpose": "Define a base test case class for unit testing, with compatibility for unittest2 if available.",
  "sources": "Import statements for unittest2 or unittest",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or data leakage points",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Use of import fallback is normal; no suspicious code or hidden behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'unittest2' as 'unittest' for enhanced testing features if available, otherwise defaults to standard 'unittest'. It defines a 'TestCase' class extending 'unittest.TestCase' with a large 'maxDiff' value. There are no input sources, data flows, or malicious constructs. The code is straightforward and typical for test setup. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test base class setup with no malicious or suspicious behaviors. It primarily facilitates testing and does not pose security risks.",
