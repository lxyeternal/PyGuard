  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports a testing library, which is a common practice for compatibility. It defines a subclass of unittest.TestCase with an overridden maxDiff value. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test class setup with no malicious or security-risk behavior.",
