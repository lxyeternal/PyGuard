{
  "purpose": "The code conditionally imports 'unittest2' or 'unittest' and defines a TestCase subclass with an unusually large maxDiff value, serving as a base class for tests.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'unittest2' or 'unittest', class definition setting 'maxDiff'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows, external data handling, or untrusted input/output.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; static code with no dynamic execution or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The 'maxDiff' is set to an extremely high value (10^10), which is unusual but not malicious or insecure.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing a conditional import for compatibility and defining a test class with a large diff threshold. No untrusted data, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The large 'maxDiff' is a configuration choice, not a security concern. The code is static and standard for test setup, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The high 'maxDiff' value is unusual but harmless. All signals indicate a safe, standard test class setup.",
