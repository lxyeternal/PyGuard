  "purpose": "Define a base test case class for unit testing, with an alias for unittest2 if available.",
  "sources": "Import statements for unittest and unittest2",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as code only imports modules and defines a class",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures present",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'unittest2' as 'unittest' if available, otherwise defaults to 'unittest'. It then defines a subclass 'TestCase' that extends 'unittest.TestCase' with a custom 'maxDiff' attribute. There is no user input handling, network activity, or data leakage. No suspicious behavior or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for a testing framework with no signs of malicious behavior. It only establishes a base test class for later use.",
