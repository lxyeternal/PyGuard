  "sources": "Input from user inputs, environment variables, or files; no explicit data sources identified in the snippets.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or system commands, but no suspicious activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, files, system commands), but no malicious flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The review indicates benign Python code with standard data processing or utility functions. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious data flows are present. Confidence is high (0.9), and no suspicious behaviors are observed. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2) are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is considered safe with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects minimal concern based on available information.",
