{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script intended for data processing or transformation, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'input_data' variable or from files/readers, if present.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs or external communications occur through print statements, file writes, or network connections, if any are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source variables or input functions to processing functions, then potentially to output or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or hidden code segments detected. No unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation patterns found.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python constructs such as variable assignments, function definitions, and control flow statements. There are no signs of malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries is typical; no suspicious imports. The code does not contain any embedded obfuscation techniques, nor does it perform dangerous operations like executing shell commands or modifying system files.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign, standard Python code without any signs of malware, malicious data flows, or security vulnerabilities.",
