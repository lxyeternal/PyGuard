  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code is present.\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** Correctly states that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard setup script, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no external input processing, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Correct; standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity, static file reads, no network or dynamic code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports; consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0; no security risks identified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a typical, well-structured setup.py script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All dependencies are read from static files, and no dynamic or external inputs are processed insecurely.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The scores are appropriate given the code. No changes are necessary.",
