  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a standard setup script with no suspicious behavior. It reads static files, no dynamic code execution, no external input processing, no obfuscation, and no malware indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. **These are appropriate.**\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, it describes standard setup operations with no signs of malicious activity. No dynamic input, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. **Appropriate.**\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard package setup with static file reads, no suspicious code, no external inputs, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. **Appropriate.**\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same conclusion—standard setup script, no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. **Appropriate.**\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous reports—benign, static file reads, no external data processing, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior. Given the code's nature, malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores should stay at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is a straightforward setup script with no external inputs, no network activity, and no suspicious logic, the overall security risk remains negligible. The highest score among the reports is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard `setup.py` script for packaging a Python library.\n- It only reads static files and defines package metadata.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- No signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### **My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
