{
  "purpose": "Import statements for croniter module components and a line to satisfy the linter, with no operational logic.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local croniter module, access to croniter.__name__ for linter workaround.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow or external output.",
  "flows": "None; the code only imports and accesses an attribute without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The line 'croniter.__name__' is unusual but benign, used solely for linter compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static import statements and a benign attribute access intended as a linter workaround. No dynamic execution, user input, or external data handling is present. The attribute access does not perform any malicious action. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns. All signals point to benign behavior, and the pattern is common in Python modules to prevent linter warnings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The only unusual line is a benign linter workaround. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.",
