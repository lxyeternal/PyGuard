{
  "purpose": "This code implements a cron expression parser and iterator, allowing the calculation of next/previous scheduled times based on cron syntax, with support for complex expressions, timezone handling, and optional hash-based expansions.",
  "sources": "Input data includes cron expression strings, start times, hash IDs, and date/time objects provided to methods such as expand(), get_next(), get_prev(), and match_range(). Data flows from these input points into internal parsing and calculation functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include methods that generate timestamps and datetime objects, which can be used to schedule tasks. There are no evident data leaks or unsafe outputs; the code primarily processes and returns date/time values.",
  "flows": "Sources like user-provided cron strings and start times flow into expansion and validation functions. Parsed expressions are expanded into value ranges, which are then used in date calculations within _get_next/_calc. Hash-based expansions can influence the generated schedule. Data flows from parsing into calculation and timestamp/datetime conversion functions, then outputs are generated by get_next(), get_prev(), or iteration methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials or backdoors are present. The use of 'random.randint' in HashExpander could be viewed as non-deterministic, but it is used for hash/random range generation, not malicious purposes. No obfuscated code or malicious system commands are detected. The code uses standard libraries for date/time processing, and optional imports are handled safely. No suspicious network, file, or privacy-violating operations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a complex cron expression parsing and iteration library, including multiple validation, expansion, and time calculation functions. The hash expansion component generates pseudo-random or hashed schedule components but does not perform external communications or data exfiltration. The timestamp and datetime conversions are standard. There are no signs of malicious data flow, injection, or system sabotage. The code appears to be a legitimate cron scheduling utility with optional hash-based features for pseudo-random schedules.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard cron expression parser and scheduler with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs date/time calculations and supports hash-based expansion for schedule variation, but these features are not malicious. No malware signals are detected. The overall security risk is low.",
