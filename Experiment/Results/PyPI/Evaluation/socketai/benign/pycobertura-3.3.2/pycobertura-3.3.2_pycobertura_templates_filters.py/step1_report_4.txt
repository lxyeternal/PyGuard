{
  "purpose": "Define Jinja2 filters for use in templates related to line status and reasons, mainly for rendering HTML elements and styling.",
  "sources": "Input data includes line objects with attributes 'status' and 'reason'. No external data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Returns HTML-safe strings and style indicators; no direct data leaks or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Input attributes (line.status, line.reason) are mapped through dictionaries and functions to produce HTML snippets and style strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. Functions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple dictionary lookups and conditional functions to generate style and icon strings for templates. No input is processed from untrusted sources other than object attributes, which are used for display purposes. No external calls, network activity, or file operations are observed. The code does not perform any dynamic execution or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign template filter definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply maps object attributes to display strings. No malware or security issues are detected.",
