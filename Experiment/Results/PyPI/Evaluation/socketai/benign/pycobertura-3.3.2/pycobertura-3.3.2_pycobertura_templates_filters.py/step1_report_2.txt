  "purpose": "Define Jinja2 filters for use in templates related to line status and reasons.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'line' objects with attributes 'status' and 'reason'; string arguments like 'arg'.",
  "sinks": "Return values for HTML rendering, no external data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Input attributes are mapped via dictionaries or conditionals to HTML or style strings for rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. The dictionaries and functions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple dictionaries for mapping status and reason icons. Functions process input data, primarily 'line' objects with 'status' and 'reason' attributes, or string arguments, to produce HTML or style strings. No external data, network calls, or sensitive operations are present. The logic appears standard for template rendering, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for template rendering. No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are evident.",
