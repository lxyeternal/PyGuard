  "purpose": "Define Jinja2 filters for template rendering, including styling and icons based on line status and reason.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read external input or untrusted data; the code appears to process data passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions write to external systems or cause side effects; primarily return style or icon strings based on input.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are processed to determine output styles/icons, with no external data flows or malicious manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. The code uses simple mappings and straightforward functions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple mappings from input parameters to style or icon strings, used in templates. It lacks any external data handling, network communication, or obfuscated logic. Functions like 'line_status' and 'line_reason_icon' rely on passed objects' attributes, but there are no signs of malicious data flow or behavior. The logic is clear and standard for template filter definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as template filters with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be straightforward UI-related code with no security concerns.",
