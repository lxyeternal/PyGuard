  "purpose": "Define Jinja2 filter functions and mappings for template rendering, related to line status and reasons.",
  "sources": "None of the functions or mappings read input or external data; all data are either parameters or predefined constants.",
  "sinks": "None identified; functions return values based on input parameters without external effects or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through simple logic and mappings; no external data flow or untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines dictionaries for styling and icons, along with straightforward functions that map input data to output values. The functions handle status and reason mappings, with simple conditionals and lookups. There is no data injection, network activity, or unsafe code usage. The logic is clear, limited to data mapping and simple conditions, with no external dependencies or dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, primarily defining mappings and simple functions for template rendering purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
