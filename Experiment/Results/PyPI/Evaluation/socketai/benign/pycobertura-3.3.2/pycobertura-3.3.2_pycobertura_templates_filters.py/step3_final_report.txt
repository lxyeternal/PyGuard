{
  "purpose": "The code provides template filters for rendering line status styles and icons based on object attributes, primarily for UI presentation.",
  "sources": "The functions read object attributes such as 'status' and 'reason', and string arguments passed to functions like 'misses_color'.",
  "sinks": "The code returns static strings and HTML snippets; no untrusted data is used to influence external systems or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input attributes (status, reason) flow through functions to produce style or icon strings; no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static mappings and simple functions for rendering UI elements based on object attributes. No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are involved. The functions process object attributes to return predefined style or icon strings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and static nature strongly suggest benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward template filters with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are accurate and justified.",
