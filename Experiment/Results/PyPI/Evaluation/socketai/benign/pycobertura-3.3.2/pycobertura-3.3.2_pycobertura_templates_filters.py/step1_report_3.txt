{
  "purpose": "Provide Jinja2 filter functions and data mappings for use in templates to represent line status, reasons, and colors.",
  "sources": "None; all data is static or derived from input arguments.",
  "sinks": "None; functions return simple string values based on input, no data leakage or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are processed through straightforward conditional logic and dictionary lookups, with no complex data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of static mappings and simple functions is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static mappings for visual representations and simple functions to determine style and icon based on input objects. No external inputs, network calls, or data manipulations suggest malicious intent. The functions rely on properties of 'line' objects but do not perform unsafe operations. The logic appears to serve a purely presentation purpose without side effects or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, focusing on template rendering support with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
