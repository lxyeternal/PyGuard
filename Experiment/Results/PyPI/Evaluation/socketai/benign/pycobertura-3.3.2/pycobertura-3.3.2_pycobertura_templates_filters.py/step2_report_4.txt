  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is straightforward, consisting of mappings and simple functions for rendering templates.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- The functions process object attributes or arguments to produce style or icon strings.\n- All reports conclude benign intent, with confidence levels of 0.9 or 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** No issues, benign code, simple mappings.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No changes needed.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious activity, straightforward logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent. No changes needed.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent. No changes needed.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** Same benign assessment, straightforward mappings.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent. No changes needed.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Same as others, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malware (0). Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior, this is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly set to 0; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**However,** considering the overall context, the code is very simple, and the reports are consistent. The scores align well with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate (Post-Review):**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always remain vigilant for future code that might look similar but could contain hidden malicious logic. For now, this code and the reports are aligned with a benign assessment.",
