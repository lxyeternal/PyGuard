  "purpose": "Minimal Python setup script for package configuration using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it imports setup from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or data leaks; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code simply calls setup() with no parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; the script is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python packaging script that imports setup from setuptools and calls setup() with default parameters. It contains no external inputs, data flows, or malicious behaviors. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features support these conclusions. No anomalies or signs of malicious intent are present, and the code is consistent with best practices for a basic setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, minimal Python setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
