  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call, which may include reading configuration files or metadata (not shown here).",
  "sinks": "Potentially any functions within setup() that could execute code if extended, but in this minimal form, no such sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks in this minimal script.",
  "anomalies": "The script contains only a standard import and setup call with no parameters, no hardcoded secrets, and no unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "This is a minimal setup script importing 'setuptools' and calling setup() with default parameters. No code execution, input reading, or data processing occurs beyond the basic package setup call. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard minimal setup script with no malicious intent or security issues identified. It appears safe and typical for Python packaging.",
