  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks or points where untrusted data could cause harm.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; setup() is invoked with no arguments.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal and standard; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the setuptools library and calls setup() with default parameters. There is no user input, no dynamic code execution, and no data handling beyond this. It appears to be a typical minimal package setup script with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
