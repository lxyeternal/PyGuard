  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the script simply calls setup() without parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for Python packaging; no unusual or suspicious activity observed.",
