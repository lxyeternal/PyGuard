  "conclusion": "The code itself is straightforward and does not contain malicious payloads or obfuscation. However, the use of subprocess with unsanitized inputs and shell=True introduces a high potential for command injection if inputs are untrusted. The overall security risk is substantial, and best practices would involve sanitizing inputs or avoiding shell=True with string interpolation. The malware and obfuscation scores are correct; the risk score should be set to 0.75 to accurately reflect the vulnerability."
