{
  "purpose": "Import statements for local modules 'cobertura' and 'reporters' used to include classes and functions within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules, no external data or input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports classes and functions without executing or passing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard import syntax and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from internal modules, with no dynamic code execution, external communication, or data processing. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of '# noqa' is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module import pattern with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The current assessment and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
