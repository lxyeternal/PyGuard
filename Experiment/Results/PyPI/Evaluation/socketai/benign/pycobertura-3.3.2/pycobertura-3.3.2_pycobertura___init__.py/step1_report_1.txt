  "purpose": "Importing classes and functions from local modules 'cobertura' and 'reporters' for code functionality, likely related to reporting or coverage analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules within the package",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling observed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; only module imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for local modules, importing specific classes and functions. There are no input handling, data processing, or external communication actions. This is a typical module import pattern used for organizing code functionality. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in these statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of straightforward import statements. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are present.",
