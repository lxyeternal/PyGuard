  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, cross-check with the provided code, and assess the validity of their conclusions, the appropriateness of their scores, and any potential overlooked risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code defines type aliases for AWS Snowball and other AWS services, with conditional import of `Literal` based on Python version. Recognizes the code as static type definitions with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that the code is benign and purely for type annotations is accurate. Confidence is high (1).\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0. These are appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, it notes the static nature of the code, the conditional import, and the lack of external data handling or dynamic code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is a standard static type annotation module with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same pattern: static definitions, conditional import, no dynamic behavior, no external data flow.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the code as safe and purely declarative.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above; the code is straightforward type aliasing with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly states the code defines string literal types for static type checking, with conditional import for compatibility. No external or dynamic behavior.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate and consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0. Appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a benign, static set of type alias definitions for AWS service identifiers, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The scores assigned (malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0) are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured static type definitions module with no security concerns.",
