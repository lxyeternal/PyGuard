{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for Snowball service literals used in the boto3_stubs documentation, aiding static type checking.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external input handling present; no data leakage or external effect points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code merely declares constants and type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a standard pattern for conditional import of Literal, and extensive static string literal definitions. No suspicious or malicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines string literal types for use in type annotations, including conditional import for compatibility. No dynamic execution, code injection, or external communication mechanisms are present. The extensive list of string constants and their assignment as type literals appear to be normal and safe. The code lacks any executable logic, input handling, or side-effects that could be exploited maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward, safe definition of string literal types for static type checking purposes. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign module intended for type annotations in a larger codebase.",
