  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for AWS Snowball literals; sources are constants with Literal types.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report states the code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The code only defines string literal types and does not perform any runtime operations or data processing. The analysis is accurate; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining type annotations with Literal types, with conditional import for Python compatibility.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity, just static type definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is purely static and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type literals for AWS services, with conditional import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No external input, dynamic code, or malicious behavior; purely declarative.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type definitions, with no runtime logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No external data handling or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for static type checking, with conditional import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic execution, input handling, or external communication; purely static.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence & Functionality:** All reports correctly identify that the code only declares static string literal types and does not perform any runtime operations, data processing, or external communication.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscation & Anomalies:** No obfuscation or anomalies are detected; the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code's static, declarative nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, since there's no indication of security risk or malicious intent.\n\n**Additional notes:** The only dynamic aspect is the conditional import for Python version compatibility, which is standard practice and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign, static type definition module with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n**My personal estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is safe and purely serves as a type annotation aid for static analysis.",
