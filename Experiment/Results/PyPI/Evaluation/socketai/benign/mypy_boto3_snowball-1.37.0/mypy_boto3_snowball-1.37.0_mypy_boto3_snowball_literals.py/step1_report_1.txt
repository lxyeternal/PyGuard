  "purpose": "Define type annotations for AWS Snowball service literals and other AWS service identifiers for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned with Literal types; imports of sys and typing for conditional imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A – No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and consists solely of type alias definitions and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up string literal type aliases for various AWS Snowball and other AWS service identifiers, with conditional imports of the 'Literal' type based on Python version. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious or malicious behavior, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or external data handling. The only dynamic aspect is the conditional import of 'Literal' for Python versions earlier than 3.12, which is standard practice. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign module providing type annotations for AWS SDK usage, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
