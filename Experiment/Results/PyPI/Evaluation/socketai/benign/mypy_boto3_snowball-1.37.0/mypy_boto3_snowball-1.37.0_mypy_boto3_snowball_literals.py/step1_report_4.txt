  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various Snowball service literals used in type annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads system version info from sys.version_info and imports Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the code primarily defines constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; this code only sets type annotations and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior. The code is straightforward and purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports Literal based on Python version, then defines multiple Literal type aliases for various string constants used for type safety in other modules. No external input handling, network communication, or malicious code logic is present. The entire file is a static definition of types and constants, which poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "This module only provides static type definitions and constants for the Snowball service, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is a benign, purely declarative file used for type safety.",
