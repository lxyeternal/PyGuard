  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for AWS Snowball literals; sources are constants with Literal types.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report states the code is static, benign, with no suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is straightforward, defining string literal types for AWS Snowball and other AWS services. No dynamic code, no external data, no signs of malicious activity. The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, defines Literal types for AWS Snowball and other services.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or suspicious activity; purely static type annotations.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Same as above. The code is static, safe, and serves as type hints. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type literals for Snowball and AWS services; conditional import of Literal.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No external input, dynamic code, or malicious activity. Only static definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static type definitions with conditional import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No external data, no dynamic behavior, purely declarative.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment is correct; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for AWS Snowball, with conditional import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, no dynamic code, only static constants.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is benign and purely for type annotations.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Justification:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static, defining type aliases for AWS service identifiers.\n- **Malware & Security Risks:** All reports assign malware=0 and securityRisk=0, which is appropriate. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Confidence:** All reports show high confidence (1), which is justified given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — static definitions pose no security risk.\n\n**Final note:** The code is a benign, static type alias module used for type safety in Python projects interacting with AWS SDKs. The scores in all reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** No changes needed. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code's nature.",
