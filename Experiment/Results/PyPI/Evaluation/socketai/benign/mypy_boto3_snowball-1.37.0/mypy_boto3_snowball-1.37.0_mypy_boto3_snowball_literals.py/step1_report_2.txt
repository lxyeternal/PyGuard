  "purpose": "Define and provide type annotations for string literal types used in boto3 snowball service.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and conditionally imports Literal; defines several Literal types with hardcoded string values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted data or external data sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; mainly static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; code is straightforward type aliasing with literals, no unusual or suspicious code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type annotations for various string literals representing AWS Snowball service parameters. It conditionally imports Literal for compatibility with Python versions before 3.12. The literals are static and hardcoded, serving as type constraints for other code. No external input, dynamic code execution, or data manipulation is present. The code appears solely as a static type definition module, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard static type annotation module for AWS Snowball literals. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. Its purpose is purely for type safety and code clarity in type-checked Python code.",
