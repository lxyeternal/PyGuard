  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type annotations for AWS Snowball literals; no external or untrusted data involved.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is static, straightforward, with no malicious behavior. It uses conditional import for Python compatibility.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is appropriate. No obfuscation or security issues detected.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully benign, purely for static type annotations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—type annotations for AWS Snowball and other AWS services.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic code, no external data, no suspicious constructs. It’s a static type alias module.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** Also benign, standard static type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines literals for Snowball and AWS services; uses conditional import for Python version compatibility.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic or malicious behavior; purely static definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, aligned with the content.\n\n**Assessment:** Safe, straightforward, no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—type annotations with conditional import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No external input, no dynamic code, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Benign static type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for AWS Snowball and other services, with conditional import.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No executable logic, no external data, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** Safe, purely declarative.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports describe a module that defines string literal types for AWS services and Snowball, primarily for static type checking.\n- **Behavior:** No dynamic code, no external data handling, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** All scores are 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Potential Concerns:** No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or vulnerabilities. The code is standard for type annotation modules.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Confirmed as 0 across all reports; appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, since there are no security issues.\n\n**However,** considering the nature of this code (static type definitions), I would assign an even lower risk score, possibly 0, as it poses no threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**The code is a benign, static type annotation module for AWS services, with no malicious or security concerns.** The current scores are appropriate and should remain at 0 for malware and security risk. The obfuscated score is correctly 0.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
