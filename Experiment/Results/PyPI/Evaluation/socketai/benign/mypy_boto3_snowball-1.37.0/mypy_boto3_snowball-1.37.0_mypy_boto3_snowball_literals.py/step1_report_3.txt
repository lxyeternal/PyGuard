  "purpose": "Define type literals for Snowball service and other AWS services, likely for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Type alias definitions using Literal, imported from typing or typing_extensions depending on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into vulnerable functions; the code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external inputs to sensitive operations; only static definitions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is purely declarative with type annotations; no dynamic code, eval, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides Python type annotations for various string literals used in AWS Snowball and other AWS services. It conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines multiple Literal type aliases. The purpose appears to be for static type checking and validation within a larger codebase. No user input, external data sources, or runtime behaviors are involved. The structure is straightforward and standard for type definitions, with no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code does not perform any operations, network access, or data manipulation; it only declares constants for type safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static definition of type aliases for AWS service literals with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
