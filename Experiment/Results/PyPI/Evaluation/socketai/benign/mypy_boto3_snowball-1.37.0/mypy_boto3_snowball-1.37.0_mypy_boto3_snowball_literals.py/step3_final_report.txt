  "purpose": "Defines static type aliases for AWS Snowball and other AWS service identifiers using Literal types for static type checking.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments for each Literal type, with conditional import of Literal based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or handle external input or data.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static type alias definitions with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Literal conditionally for Python compatibility, then declares multiple type aliases as string literals. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The structure is simple and intended solely for static type annotations. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module for type annotations with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals and reports correctly identify its safe, declarative nature. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores are appropriate and should remain at 0.",
