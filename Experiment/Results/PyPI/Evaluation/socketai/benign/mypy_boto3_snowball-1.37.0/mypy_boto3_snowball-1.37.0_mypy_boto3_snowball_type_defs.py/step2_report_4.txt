  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the claims and ensure consistency with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as type annotations for Snowball API definitions, sourced from type definitions, imports, and sys.version_info checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or execution; purely static type hints.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is purely declarative.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the code as safe, with high confidence (1).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion that the code is safe and purely static is accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines type annotations for AWS Snowball interactions, with no external data sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or data processing, only static type annotations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No dynamic code, secrets, or obfuscation. The code is a set of type definitions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid conclusion; the code is safe and static.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's nature. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, describes type annotations for Snowball SDK.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious logic or obfuscation. The code is static and purely declarative.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct, the code is safe.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code defines data structures for API interactions, with no external data inputs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external effects.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or dynamic code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; the code is a standard schema definition.\n\n**Assessment:** The assessment is appropriate; no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as static type definitions for boto3 Snowball.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data flow or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, the code is benign.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify the code as static type definitions.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected. No dynamic code, external calls, or obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Essentially zero, as the code only defines data schemas.\n- **Obfuscation:** Absent.\n- **Scores:** The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores assigned (all zero or very low) are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a set of static type annotations using Python's `TypedDict`, `Union`, and conditional imports for compatibility.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- The purpose is purely to provide type hints for API request/response schemas, which is a standard practice in SDKs or type-annotated codebases.\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (No malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (Clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (No security risk in static type definitions)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe.
