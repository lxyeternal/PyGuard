  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for potential issues, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Content:** Describes static type definitions for AWS Snowball API, with no runtime logic.  \n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no data processing, no external input handling.  \n- **Conclusion:** Purely declarative, safe, and standard.  \n- **Malware & Risk Scores:** Both at 0, consistent with the analysis.  \n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Content:** Similar to Report 1, defining type annotations for Snowball API.  \n- **Findings:** No dynamic code, no external data handling, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** Static type definitions, safe and benign.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0, matching the analysis.  \n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Content:** Same as above, with detailed description of type annotations and data schemas.  \n- **Findings:** No executable code, no external interactions, purely static type hints.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or security risk.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0, consistent.  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Content:** Type annotations for Snowball API, similar structure.  \n- **Findings:** No data flow, no external data processing, no obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Static, safe, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.1 (slightly above zero, but justified given the nature).  \n**Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk score is acceptable due to the nature of the code being purely declarative. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Content:** Same as others—type definitions for SDK.  \n- **Findings:** No dynamic logic, no external data handling, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely for static type checking.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that this code is a set of static type definitions using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.  \n- **Behavior & Flow:** No runtime logic, no data processing, no external interactions, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.  \n- **Malicious Indicators:** None detected. No hardcoded secrets, no code injection, no suspicious imports or behaviors.  \n- **Security Risks:** Essentially none; the code is purely declarative.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0** — code is straightforward and transparent.  \n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any dynamic or executable code, a **risk score of 0** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of static type definitions for AWS Snowball SDK interactions. It poses no security threat, contains no obfuscation, and is consistent across all reports. The current scores are appropriate, and I concur with the assessments.\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
