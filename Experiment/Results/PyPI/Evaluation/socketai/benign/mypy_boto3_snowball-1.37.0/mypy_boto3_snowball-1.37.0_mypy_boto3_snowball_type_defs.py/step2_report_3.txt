  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes type annotations for AWS Snowball API data models.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or execution, just static type definitions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no dynamic code, no external data handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, purely declarative, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature of the code and absence of runtime logic.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the static, schema-defining purpose.\n- No runtime code, no external interactions, no dynamic behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Focuses on the lack of data processing, external effects, or suspicious patterns.\n- No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.\n- Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), but justified as minimal uncertainty due to the nature of supply chain code (type definitions).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar conclusions: static type definitions, no runtime logic, no external effects.\n- No malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** All reports agree that this code is purely static type annotations for AWS SDK (boto3) Snowball API interactions.\n- **Malicious Activity:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- **Security Risks:** Minimal; mainly the potential for supply chain issues if the source package is compromised, but the code itself is benign.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Confidence Level:** 1 (high), as all reports concur.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated or manually written set of Python type definitions.\n- No dynamic code, no external data handling, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- The minimal security risk score (0.1) in one report is justified as a conservative measure acknowledging supply chain attack possibilities, but the code itself remains safe.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, straightforward type definitions.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — the code itself is safe; supply chain risk is external and not evidenced here.\n\n**Summary:** This code is a safe, static set of type annotations for AWS Snowball SDK, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The overall security posture is benign.",
