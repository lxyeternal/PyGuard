  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS Snowball service interactions.",
  "sources": "Constants, imports, and type definitions. No input reading or external data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data leak points; code is mainly type definitions and data structures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily static type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive set of TypedDict classes and type aliases for Snowball service API data structures. It imports standard and third-party typing modules conditionally based on Python version, ensuring compatibility. There are no functions executing runtime code, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The code appears to be purely static type annotations for API request/response schemas, which poses no direct security threat. No suspicious logic, data exfiltration, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward collection of type definitions for AWS Snowball service, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is purely static and intended for type checking, with no executable or dynamic code involved.",
