{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for Snowball service type definitions, used for API interactions and data validation.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, conditional type imports based on Python version, and defines numerous TypedDict classes with fields possibly derived from external API responses.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data processing; no code that executes external commands, writes to files, or performs network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to data structures initialization and type annotations; no active data processing or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code contains standard type definitions with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of structured type definitions (TypedDict) for API request and response payloads, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. No executable logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. It is a straightforward, well-organized schema definition module, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, defining data structures for the Snowball service API. It does not contain malicious logic, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be standard, safe type annotation code with no indicators of supply chain attacks.",
