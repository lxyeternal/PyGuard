{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for Snowball service API requests and responses, facilitating type safety and clarity in SDKs or codebases.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (sys, datetime, typing), local modules (literals), and data definitions within this module (TypedDicts, Union types). No external data inputs or untrusted sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute system commands. Data structures are purely declarative, used for type checking and documentation.",
  "flows": "Not applicable—this code does not process or execute data flows; it only defines data types and structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior observed. The code contains only type annotations, class definitions, and conditional imports based on Python version compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of Python type definitions for a Snowball service SDK, including TypedDicts and Union types. It uses conditional imports to support multiple Python versions and only imports standard or local modules. No runtime logic, code execution, or data handling occurs, reducing risk of malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or external command calls are present. The primary purpose is static type hinting and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, non-malicious set of type definitions intended for SDK or API client development. It shows no signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks. It strictly serves to define data structures with no executable or unsafe behaviors.",
