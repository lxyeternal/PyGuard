  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, examining the details and reasoning to determine if the assessments are accurate and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is purely static type definitions for AWS Snowball API interactions, with no runtime logic, input handling, or malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the absence of dynamic code, external data processing, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate; the code is a standard static type annotation module.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid assessment, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a collection of type annotations and data structures without any malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is static, with no data flow from untrusted sources, no code execution, and no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid and well-founded.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is just type definitions, with no runtime logic or external data handling.\n- **Analysis:** Appropriately notes the absence of dynamic code, external interactions, or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0 — fitting.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a set of type annotations for API payloads, with no active data processing.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the code is purely declarative, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0.1 — slightly above zero, but given the nature of the code, this is acceptable as a conservative estimate. The minor security risk score might reflect a generic caution but isn't evidence of actual risk.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides static type definitions for boto3's Snowball SDK, with no runtime effects.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly observes that the code is only type annotations, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, SecurityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Well justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is purely static type annotations with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All malware and obfuscation scores are zero, with minimal or zero security risk scores, which aligns with the nature of the code.\n- **Logic and reasoning:** Consistent, well-justified, and based on the code's static, declarative nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should stay at 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Should be very low (0 or close to 0), as this is purely type annotation code.\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, auto-generated set of Python type definitions for AWS Snowball SDK interactions. It contains no executable logic, no data handling, no network or file operations, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis analysis confirms that the supply chain security risk from this code is negligible.",
