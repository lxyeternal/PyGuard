  "purpose": "Static type definitions for AWS Snowball SDK interactions, providing type annotations for request and response schemas using TypedDict and related constructs.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class definitions, and conditional imports based on Python version; no runtime data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, external data handling, or dynamic code execution; purely declarative type definitions.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks as there is no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type annotations defining data schemas for AWS Snowball API interactions. It uses standard Python typing constructs, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. There are no functions, runtime logic, external data processing, or network interactions. The code is straightforward, transparent, and designed for type checking, not execution. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's static, declarative nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of type definitions with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It poses no threat in the supply chain context and is safe for use.",
