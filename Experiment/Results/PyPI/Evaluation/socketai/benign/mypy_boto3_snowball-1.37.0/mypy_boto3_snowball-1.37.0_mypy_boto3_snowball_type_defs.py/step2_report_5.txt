  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code to determine if there are any security concerns, anomalies, or inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code consists solely of static type definitions (`TypedDict`, `Union`, `Literal`, etc.) for AWS Snowball API interactions.\n- There are no functions, runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling.\n- Conditional imports based on Python version are standard practice for compatibility.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code patterns are present.\n- No external network calls, file operations, or code execution occurs within this module.\n- The purpose appears to be providing type annotations for SDK or API client development, not executing any logic.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations for Snowball API data models.  \n- Findings: No untrusted data processing, no suspicious behavior, purely static type definitions.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Conclusion: Safe, standard, non-malicious.  \n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations for Snowball interactions.  \n- Findings: No data flow from untrusted sources, no dynamic code, no obfuscation.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Conclusion: No malicious activity detected.  \n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Type definitions for API requests/responses.  \n- Findings: No external data handling, no code execution, purely static.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Conclusion: Safe, non-malicious.  \n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Type annotations for Snowball in boto3 SDK.  \n- Findings: No active data processing, no external interactions, no obfuscation.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Conclusion: No malicious intent or security risks.  \n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Type definitions for boto3 Snowball API.  \n- Findings: No runtime logic, no external effects, purely declarative.  \n- Malware score: 0  \n- Conclusion: Benign, safe, purely for static type checking.  \n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Summary:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** Entirely static type definitions; no runtime code, no data processing, no external calls.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None detected. No obfuscated code, no hidden behaviors.\n- **Security Risks:** None apparent; no secrets, no external dependencies affecting runtime security.\n- **Consistency of Scores:** All reports correctly assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as 0.\n\n### **My Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — clear, straightforward type definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — purely static, safe code with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of static type annotations for AWS Snowball SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No action needed. This code is safe and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
