{
  "purpose": "Type annotations for snowball service type definitions, providing structured data models for AWS Snowball related API interactions.",
  "sources": "Type definitions and data structure declarations, including imported literals, sys.version_info checks, and module-level type declarations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed; no input handling, network operations, or code execution present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines data schemas without dynamic data flows or runtime logic, serving as static type hints for API payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are detected. The use of type annotations and sys.version_info checks are standard and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of TypedDict class definitions for structured data used in AWS Snowball API interactions, with conditional imports based on Python version. It includes no executable code, input handling, or data processing that could be malicious. All patterns are consistent with static type definitions, and there are no suspicious behaviors or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of Python type definitions for a specific AWS service, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely declarative and safe.",
