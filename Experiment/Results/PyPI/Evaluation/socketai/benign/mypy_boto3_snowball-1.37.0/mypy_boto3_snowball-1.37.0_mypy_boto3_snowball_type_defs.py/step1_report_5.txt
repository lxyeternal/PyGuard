{
  "purpose": "This code provides type definitions for the Snowball service in the boto3 AWS SDK, primarily used for type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations, imported constants, and system version info; it also defines various TypedDict structures for request/response objects.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks for untrusted data or external effects such as network, file, or environment modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to type definitions and data structures; no runtime data flow or untrusted data processing is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated logic, or suspicious imports are present. The code is straightforward and purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type definitions using TypedDict, conditional imports based on Python version, and no executable logic or external calls. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are identified. It uses standard Python typing features and appears to be an autogenerated or library code meant for static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static type definitions for the Snowball service API in boto3, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is benign and intended for type safety.",
