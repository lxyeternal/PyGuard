  "purpose": "Setup script for mypy-boto3-snowball package, used to configure package installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports setup from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "Reads file content into LONG_DESCRIPTION, then passes configuration data to setup() without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads the README.md file, and calls setup() with static package configuration data. No dynamic execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted data. The only external file read is a static README.md, which is typical for setup scripts. No code injections, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
