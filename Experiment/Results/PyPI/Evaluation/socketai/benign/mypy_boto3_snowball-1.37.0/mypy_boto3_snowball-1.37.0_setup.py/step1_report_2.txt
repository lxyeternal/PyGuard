{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the package 'mypy-boto3-snowball' for distribution using setuptools, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, and static package metadata from variables and setup arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data or external inputs; the script is purely for package setup.",
  "flows": "N/A – no dynamic data flows or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard setup procedures, no obfuscated or suspicious code features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Path from pathlib and setup from setuptools, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with static metadata and dependencies. There are no external inputs, user inputs, or untrusted data sources. The dependencies are version-specific but not malicious. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious logic are present. The script is a typical setup.py for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard, benign setup script for Python package distribution, with no indications of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
