{
  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the Python package 'mypy-boto3-snowball'.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata; no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from local files and hardcoded parameters into setup(), with no dynamic or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports standard modules, reads a local README.md for description, and calls setup() with fixed parameters. It does not perform any dynamic execution, network activity, or handle untrusted input. No obfuscation or secrets are present. All signals indicate benign behavior. The code's simplicity and static nature mean there are no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign package setup file with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All provided reports correctly identify it as safe, with scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are justified given the code's static and straightforward nature.",
