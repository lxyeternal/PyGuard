{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-snowball package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the __file__ attribute to locate README.md, imports Path and setuptools, and uses hardcoded strings for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no user input or external data sources are processed or used to influence behavior.",
  "flows": "The script reads a static README file and passes static parameters to the setup() function without any data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and defines package metadata with static values. It reads the README.md file to set the long description, which is common practice. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources influence the setup process. There are no signs of malicious code, suspicious behaviors, or obfuscation. All actions are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
