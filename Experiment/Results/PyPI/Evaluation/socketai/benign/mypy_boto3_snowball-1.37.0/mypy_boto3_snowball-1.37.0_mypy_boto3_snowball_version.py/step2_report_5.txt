  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency, correctness, and to identify any overlooked risks.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple static assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- No dynamic inputs, external data, or complex logic are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are detected.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future year \"2025\" in the copyright comment, which is likely a typo or oversight but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Verdict:** No issues, straightforward version declaration.\n- **Score justification:** Malware and security risk scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 1, appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Verdict:** Same as above, benign code.\n- **Anomaly:** Future year (2025) in the comment—potential typo, but not security relevant.\n- **Score justification:** No malware, obfuscation, or risk; scores seem appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, slightly lower due to the unusual year.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Verdict:** Clear, standard version assignment.\n- **Scores:** All zeros for malware/security risk; consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 1, fitting given the code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Verdict:** Same as above.\n- **Anomaly:** Future year (2025), same as previous.\n- **Scores:** All zeros; appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Verdict:** Same conclusion.\n- **Anomaly:** Future year, consistent with others.\n- **Scores:** Zero malware/security risk.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify that the code is just a static version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All are reasonable; no need to adjust scores. The malware and security risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n- **Justification for higher scores:**  \n  No reason to assign higher scores since there's no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Anomalies (future year 2025):**  \n  Slightly unusual but not malicious. It could be a typo or an oversight but doesn't impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the simplicity and the consensus, I agree with the existing scores. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, benign version declaration with no security concerns. The only minor anomaly is the future year in the comment, which does not affect security. The scores are appropriate and consistent across reports.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- Confirm that the code remains a safe, straightforward version string assignment.\n\n**End of review.**",
