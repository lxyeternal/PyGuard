  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine whether the issues identified are valid, whether the scores assigned are appropriate, and whether any inconsistencies or overestimations exist.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a simple assignment of a static version string to `__version__`.\n- No external input, dynamic code, or data flow exists.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Findings:** Straightforward version assignment, no anomalies, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, notes the future year as unusual but not suspicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. Slightly less than perfect confidence due to the unusual future year, but no actual security concern.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard version declaration, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, mentions the future year as a minor anomaly but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly conservative but acceptable. The future year is a minor anomaly but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All correctly assign 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n- **Confidence:** Mostly 1, with one at 0.9 due to the future year anomaly, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear, simple, and standard.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0** — no security risk, no dynamic behavior, no external inputs, and no vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Comments:\n\n- The only minor anomaly is the future year (2025), which is not a security concern but could be a typo or placeholder.\n- The scores across reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed unless future context suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and I concur with their assessments.\n\n**My final estimate:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0**  \n- Risk: **0**",
