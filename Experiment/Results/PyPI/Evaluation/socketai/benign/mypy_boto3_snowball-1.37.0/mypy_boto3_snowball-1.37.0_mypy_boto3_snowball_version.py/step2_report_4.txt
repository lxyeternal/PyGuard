  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple assignment of a static version string to `__version__`.\n- No dynamic code, user input, external data, or complex logic is present.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The only anomaly noted is the future year \"2025\" in the copyright comment, which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of the code itself:** The code matches the description; it is a straightforward static assignment.\n- **Malicious activity or security risks:** None are evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Suspicious patterns or anomalies:** The future year (2025) in the comment is unusual but not harmful.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard. No logical errors are apparent.\n- The mention of the future year as \"potentially suspicious\" is reasonable, but it does not constitute a security concern.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk score is 0 across all reports, also appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or 0.9), consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is static, contains no external inputs, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior, the overall risk is negligible.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future year, which does not elevate the risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The only potential point of contention could be the future year, but it does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a standard, benign version declaration.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The current scoring accurately reflects the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the overall analysis that the code is a typical version string assignment with no security concerns.",
