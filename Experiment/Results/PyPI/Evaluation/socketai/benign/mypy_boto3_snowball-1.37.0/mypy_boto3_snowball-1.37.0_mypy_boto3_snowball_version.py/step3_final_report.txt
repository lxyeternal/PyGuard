  "purpose": "Declare the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the string '__version__' to '1.37.0'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, input, or external data sources are used.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow, input, or output occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year is set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date, an unusual but benign anomaly.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string to '__version__'. It contains no dynamic code, user input, external data, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025), which could be a typo or placeholder but does not pose security risks. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The minor anomaly (future year) does not impact security assessment. No evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent. The only minor anomaly is the future year, which is not a security issue. No modifications are necessary.",
