  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully, focusing on the technical content, potential security issues, and consistency of scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward module that imports classes, defines an alias, and sets up exports.\n- No external input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The documentation and code structure appear standard for an SDK interface module.\n\n**Malware and obfuscation scores:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features, these scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Security risk scores:**\n- All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is consistent with the absence of any vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, execute external commands, or contain any exploitable logic.\n\n**Purpose and analysis:**\n- The purpose across reports is to serve as a main interface for the Snowball service, providing access to client and paginator classes.\n- The analysis confirms that the code is purely structural, with no malicious or security concern features.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- No issues are identified. The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n- The detailed reasoning in each report supports the conclusion that this is a benign, standard SDK interface module.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- Based on the code and reports, I agree with the assigned scores:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - SecurityRisk: 0\n\n- The code does not contain any hidden malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThis module is a benign, well-structured SDK interface with no security risks or malicious features. The reports are accurate and consistent. No further action or concern is necessary.",
