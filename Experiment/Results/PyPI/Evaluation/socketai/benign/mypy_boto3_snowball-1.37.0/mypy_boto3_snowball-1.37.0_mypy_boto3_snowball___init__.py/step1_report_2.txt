{
  "purpose": "To serve as a main interface for the Snowball service client, providing access to various paginators and the client object.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client and .paginator), and the module-level string docstring which includes usage examples.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; the code primarily defines imports, an alias, and an __all__ list without executing untrusted data or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions or outputs. The code does not process external inputs beyond module import statements and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, mainly importing classes and defining constants.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements, a documentation string, and an __all__ list, which are standard in Python modules. It does not include any user input handling, network communication, file I/O, or dynamic execution. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious patterns. The presence of a versioning and copyright notice is typical. Usage examples are contained within a docstring and do not execute during import. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module interface definition with no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks detected. It is a benign, well-structured Python module intended for providing client and paginator access to the Snowball service.",
