{
  "purpose": "Main interface for snowball service, providing access to client and paginator classes for AWS Snowball SDK.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client and .paginator), class aliasing, and documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no sinks such as network calls, file writes, or code execution points.",
  "flows": "Importing classes and defining exports; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes, defines an alias, and sets __all__ for exports. It contains only documentation and import statements, with no runtime data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. All indicators point to a benign, standard SDK interface setup with no malicious or security risk features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured SDK interface module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports' scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
