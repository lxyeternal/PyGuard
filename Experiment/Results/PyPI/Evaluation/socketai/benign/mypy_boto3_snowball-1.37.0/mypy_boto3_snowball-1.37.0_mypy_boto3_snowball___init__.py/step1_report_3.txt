{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for interacting with the AWS Snowball service, including client creation and paginator access.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client and .paginator), inline documentation, and code definitions.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted input processing or external data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks; the code mainly defines class aliases and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The licensing comment is standard. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary classes from local modules and assigns an alias to the SnowballClient class. It includes extensive inline documentation for usage. There are no input handling, data processing, or external connections beyond standard library imports. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward interface wrapper with documentation for AWS Snowball interactions. No malicious intent or security risks are apparent based on this code.",
