{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for Snowball service in boto3-stubs, providing type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports, class definitions, method signatures, property definitions, and docstrings throughout the code.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that could potentially handle untrusted data, but in this code, methods only define signatures, not execution logic.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows are visible; this code is solely type definitions and interface declarations without actual data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or logic; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code consists solely of interface/type definitions and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type annotations, class structures, and method signatures for a boto3 client wrapper for AWS Snowball. No executable logic or data processing is included that could be malicious. No suspicious imports or runtime behaviors are evident. The structure aligns with standard type stub files, including overloads for paginator creation. No signs of obfuscation, embedded malicious payloads, or data exfiltration code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured type stub definition for a boto3 Snowball client with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It serves as a static interface for type checking and documentation purposes only.",
