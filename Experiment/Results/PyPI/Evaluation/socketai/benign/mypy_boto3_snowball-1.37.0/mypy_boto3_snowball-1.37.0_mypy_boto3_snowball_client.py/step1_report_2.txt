{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for the Snowball service SDK, providing structured access to AWS Snowball API.",
  "sources": "The code primarily reads from imported modules, type definitions, and system version info. No user input, external data, or untrusted sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No direct data leaks, network transmissions, or sensitive data handling are present. No output to external systems is seen in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no evident source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the code mainly defines class structures, method signatures, and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes extensive type definitions and overloads for paginators, but no unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are detected. The license and copyright mention are standard. The code appears to be a straightforward SDK stub implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured SDK interface for AWS Snowball, defining a client class with methods, properties, and exception types. It does not execute any logic or perform any data processing. It relies on type hints and docstrings. No malicious patterns, code injection, or obfuscated constructs are present. No external data is read or written; no network operations are embedded in this code. The imports are standard, and the code adheres to typical SDK stub conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign SDK interface definition with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is a typical type-annotated client class for AWS SDK, with no suspicious anomalies.",
