  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the Snowball service client in boto3, providing type hints and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class definitions with properties and methods; method signatures with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No actual data processing or untrusted data handling present; methods are primarily interface definitions with no direct data flow or execution logic.",
  "flows": "Not applicable—this code defines interfaces, type hints, and documentation; it does not include runtime data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual constructs detected. Usage of standard boto3 and botocore interfaces without modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a type stub/interface layer for the Snowball AWS service client, providing detailed method signatures, type hints, and documentation links. It imports standard libraries and internal modules, defines an exception class, and specifies method signatures with appropriate type annotations. There is no executable code, data processing, or external data handling that could be malicious. The class and method structures align with typical AWS SDK patterns, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard interface and type annotation layer for the Snowball AWS client, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly defines method signatures and documentation references, serving as a type stub for static analysis or IDE support.",
