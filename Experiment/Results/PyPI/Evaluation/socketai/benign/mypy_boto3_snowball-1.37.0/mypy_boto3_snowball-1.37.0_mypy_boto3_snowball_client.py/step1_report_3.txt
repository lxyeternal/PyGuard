  "purpose": "Type annotations and interface definitions for the Snowball client in boto3, including exception classes, method signatures, and pagination support.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class definitions; method signatures; properties; overloads for get_paginator.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is processed or transmitted; no untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; methods accept parameters via kwargs, which are type-annotated but not used in a way that suggests malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed. Code is mostly standard interface declarations with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and class structures for a boto3 Snowball client, including exception classes, method signatures with type hints, and overloads for pagination. It imports standard modules and local modules, defining a class with properties and methods consistent with the boto3 interface. No dynamic code, network operations, or data handling that could indicate malicious activity are present. The structure appears to be standard for type stub definitions. The license and copyright statements do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type annotations and interface definitions for the boto3 Snowball client. It is well-structured, contains no suspicious or malicious logic, and is consistent with standard SDK stub implementations. There is no indication of malware or malicious behavior.",
