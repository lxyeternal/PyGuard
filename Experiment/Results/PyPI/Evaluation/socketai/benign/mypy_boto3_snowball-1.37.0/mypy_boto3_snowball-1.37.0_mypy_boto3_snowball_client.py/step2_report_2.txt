  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code provides type annotations and interface definitions for the Snowball client, based on imports, class definitions, and docstrings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime data handling or data flows are present; the code is purely static type definitions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. The code is a standard SDK stub with no embedded logic.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that the code is benign and serves as a static interface with no malicious intent is accurate. The confidence score of 1.0 is justified.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a structured SDK interface, with no indication of external data or untrusted input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or network activity; purely type annotations and class structures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The code aligns with typical SDK stub patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report's conclusion that the code is benign and standard is correct. Confidence 1.0 is justified.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports, it describes type annotations and interface definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or embedded malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the code as a benign SDK interface. Confidence score is appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a type stub/interface for the Snowball client, with no runtime logic.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation. The structure is typical for SDK type annotations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is accurate; the code is safe and legitimate.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, the code is a type stub/interface layer for the AWS Snowball client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No runtime logic or data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or embedded malicious code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The report correctly states the code is a standard SDK interface with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is purely a static, type-annotated interface for the AWS Snowball SDK client.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present in any report.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign a risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign malware score of 0.\n- **Confidence:** All reports have high confidence (1.0), which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Based on the detailed review, the code is a standard, well-structured SDK stub providing type annotations and interface definitions. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code contains no executable logic, no embedded data, no network operations, and no suspicious patterns. It serves solely as a static type interface for IDE support and static analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports' conclusions and scores are accurate and justified.",
