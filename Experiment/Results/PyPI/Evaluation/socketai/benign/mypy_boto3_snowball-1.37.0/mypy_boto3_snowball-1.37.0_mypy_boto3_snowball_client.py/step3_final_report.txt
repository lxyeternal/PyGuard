{
  "purpose": "The code provides static type annotations, class definitions, and method signatures for the AWS Snowball client SDK, serving primarily for static analysis, IDE support, and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports of modules, class and method definitions, type annotations, and documentation links.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data flows, no external data handling, no network calls, and no untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "None; the code is purely static type annotations and interface definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or embedded malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK stub with type annotations for the Snowball client, including exception classes, method signatures, and documentation links. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. The structure aligns with typical static SDK interface files intended for type checking and IDE support. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured static interface for the AWS Snowball SDK client. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate it is safe and intended solely for static analysis and documentation purposes.",
