{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and paginator class definitions for the snowball service client, aiding static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module; class method parameters for paginate functions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or executes untrusted data; no insecure data handling or external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Class methods receive keyword arguments for pagination; these are passed to the underlying Paginator's paginate method, with no complex data flow outside typical API usage.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic detected. The code strictly defines type annotations and class structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward type-annotated module defining paginator classes for the snowball service. It conditionally imports 'Unpack' based on Python version, uses type hints, and inherits from botocore Paginator classes. The classes include a paginate method with proper typing, referencing external documentation for clarity. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure and content are typical for a type stub module aimed at improving static analysis and IDE support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of type definitions and class wrappers for Snowball paginator functionalities. No malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks are present.",
