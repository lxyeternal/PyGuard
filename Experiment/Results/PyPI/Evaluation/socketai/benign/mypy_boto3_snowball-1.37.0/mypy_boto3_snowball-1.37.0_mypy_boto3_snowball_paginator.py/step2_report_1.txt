  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security implications, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code defines type annotations and paginator classes for the Snowball client, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It emphasizes that the code is standard, benign, and solely for static type checking.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity. It contains class definitions, type annotations, and documentation links, all consistent with typical boto3 stub files.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — correct, no malicious code.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct, code is clear and standard.  \n  - **Risk:** 0 — justified, no security issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard patterns, no suspicious code, and safe practices. It highlights proper use of conditional imports, type annotations, and class inheritance.\n\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies or malicious behavior. The code is a typical type stub for boto3 paginators.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — appropriate.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — appropriate.  \n  - **Risk:** 0 — justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the report confirms the code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It notes the code is purely for type annotations and documentation.\n\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns or dangerous operations. The code is consistent with typical SDK stub files.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — correct.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.  \n  - **Risk:** 0 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report finds no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and states the code is standard boilerplate for boto3 stubs, with proper use of conditional imports and type annotations.\n\n- **Assessment:** No evidence of malicious activity or security concerns. The code is purely for static type checking.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — appropriate.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — appropriate.  \n  - **Risk:** 0 — justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, confirming the code is benign, well-structured, and serves as a type definition module without malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — correct.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — correct.  \n  - **Risk:** 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:**  \n  The code is a standard set of boto3 stub classes for Snowball paginators, with no malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks. It strictly provides type annotations and documentation links, with no data processing, network calls, or secret handling.\n\n- **Scores Justification:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments needed.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:**  \n  Since the code is purely static type definitions, the only concern would be hidden malicious behavior, which is not evident here.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risks present.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, standard boto3 paginator stub module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
