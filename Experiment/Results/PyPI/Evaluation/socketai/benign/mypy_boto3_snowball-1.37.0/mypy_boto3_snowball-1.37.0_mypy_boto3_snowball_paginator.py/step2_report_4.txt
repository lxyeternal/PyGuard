  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as defining type annotations and paginator classes for the Snowball client.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks or dangerous data flows; the code is purely type definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard, benign, and aligned with boto3's patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code is for type annotations and paginator classes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data processing; just class definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is standard and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the code's role in type annotations and paginator classes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks or malicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward, benign type stub.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; defines paginator classes with type annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or dangerous processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly identifies the code as benign and standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; the code provides type annotations and class definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately describes the code as a benign type stub.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; set to 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; set to 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, all should be 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3's Snowball service. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
