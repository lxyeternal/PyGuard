{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginator classes for the snowball service client in boto3, facilitating type-checked pagination of API responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class methods that define paginate functions.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs that are unpacked from type definitions; no untrusted data sources or data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data could flow from **kwargs in paginate methods to the underlying Paginator classes, but these are strictly type annotations and method signatures; no actual data processing or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard boilerplate for boto3 stubs, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of sys.version_info for conditional imports is normal. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several paginator classes for the snowball service, each inheriting from a generic Paginator class with specific type annotations for requests and responses. The paginate methods accept keyword arguments typed via Unpack with specific type definitions, aligning with boto3 conventions. Conditional imports handle Python version differences. The code is well-structured, with clear documentation links and no signs of malicious behavior, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. It appears to be a legitimate stub file for static type checking of boto3's paginators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign type annotation and class definition file for boto3 snowball paginators. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. It primarily facilitates static type checking and code completion without executing any dangerous operations.",
