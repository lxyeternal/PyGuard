{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and paginator classes for the snowball service client in boto3, facilitating type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads type definitions from imported modules, system information (sys.version_info), and relies on class inheritance and method definitions. No external or untrusted input sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to class definitions and method signatures. No sensitive sinks like network connections, file writes, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from class definitions to method implementations, mainly involving type annotations and class inheritance. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code appears to be standard for type annotations and paginator class definitions. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines paginator classes with type annotations for the snowball service in boto3, utilizing standard Python typing practices and conditional imports based on Python version. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The structure adheres to common patterns for SDK type definitions, and the code serves as a type-safe wrapper around boto3's paginator functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious type annotation and class definition module for boto3 snowball paginators. It contains no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
