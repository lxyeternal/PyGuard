{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for the boto3 Snowball client, facilitating static type checking and documentation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, method signatures, and type annotations within the paginator classes, primarily reading input parameters for pagination requests.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data processing; the code only defines classes and methods for static typing.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are unpacked into request types; no data flows to external systems or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions inheriting from Paginator with specific type parameters, and paginate methods that accept request parameters. It includes conditional imports for compatibility. There are no runtime data manipulations, network operations, or security-sensitive actions. The purpose is solely for static type annotations and documentation support, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of boto3 stub classes for Snowball paginators, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The scores assigned by the initial reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and the overall security risk is also 0.",
