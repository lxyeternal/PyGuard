{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations and paginator classes for the Snowball service client in boto3, facilitating type-safe pagination.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type definitions; class method parameters accepting **kwargs with specific type annotations.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods accept **kwargs that are unpacked as specific request types, but do not process untrusted input directly; no external data sinks or network operations are performed within this code.",
  "flows": "The paginate methods pass unpacked **kwargs of specific request types to the parent class's method, which is standard in boto3 paginator implementations. No dangerous data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be standard boto3 paginator definitions with type annotations; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present. Use of sys.version_info to conditionally import Unpack is normal for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes with proper type annotations for boto3 Snowball service, leveraging conditional imports for compatibility. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The class structures and methods follow documented patterns. No suspicious imports or operations are observed. The code's purpose is to provide type-safe interfaces for paginating through AWS Snowball responses.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of boto3 paginator stubs with type annotations. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely to improve type safety and usability for the Snowball client's paginators.",
