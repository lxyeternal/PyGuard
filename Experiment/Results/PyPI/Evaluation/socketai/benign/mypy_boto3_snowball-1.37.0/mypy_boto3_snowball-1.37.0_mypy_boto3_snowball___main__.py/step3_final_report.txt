  "purpose": "Provides CLI commands to display static package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Outputs package info and version strings to stdout.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version(), otherwise print_info() executes, both outputting static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on a command-line argument. It uses sys.argv for input detection and sys.stdout.write for output. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The code structure is simple, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. All signals indicate benign behavior. The reports correctly identify the code as safe, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with full confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these scores, and no issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package information. It shows no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of zero are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
