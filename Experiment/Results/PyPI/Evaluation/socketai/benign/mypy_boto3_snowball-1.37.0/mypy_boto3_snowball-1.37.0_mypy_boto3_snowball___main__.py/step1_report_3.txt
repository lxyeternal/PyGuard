  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The script provides informational output based on command-line input. It reads input from sys.argv and outputs to sys.stdout, both standard methods. There are no external data sources, network connections, or credential handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed. The code is straightforward and serves only informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility that outputs package info and version. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
