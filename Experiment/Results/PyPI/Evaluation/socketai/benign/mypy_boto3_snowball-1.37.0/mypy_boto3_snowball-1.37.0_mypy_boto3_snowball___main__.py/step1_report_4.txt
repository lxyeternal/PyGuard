{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI entry point to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv and writes output to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via sys.stdout.write; no untrusted data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument parsing directs flow to print_version() or print_info(), both of which output static information.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and only outputs predefined strings.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and primarily outputs static package information based on command-line arguments. It does not process external data or user inputs beyond checking for '--version'. No data leakage, backdoors, or malicious commands are present. The use of sys.stdout.write is standard and safe. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard CLI operations without any malicious intent or security risks.",
