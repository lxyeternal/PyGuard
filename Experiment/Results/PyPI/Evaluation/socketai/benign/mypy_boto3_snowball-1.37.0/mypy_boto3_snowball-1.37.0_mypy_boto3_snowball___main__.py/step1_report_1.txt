  "purpose": "Provide CLI commands to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout.write for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for printing information",
  "flows": "Command-line argument (e.g., --version) → print_version() or print_info() → sys.stdout.write",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily offers simple CLI functions to output package metadata and version. It reads command-line input to determine behavior but does not process or execute untrusted data beyond printing predefined strings. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The structure is straightforward and typical for CLI scripts. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, serving only to display package information and version details. There are no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
