  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details.\n- It processes command-line arguments (specifically `--version`) and prints predefined strings.\n- It uses standard Python modules (`sys`) and straightforward logic.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** None. The code matches the description and performs only the intended static output functions.\n- **Malicious activity:** None observed.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risks:** None.\n- **Flow and data handling:** Standard and safe.\n\n### Review of each report:\nAll five reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and only outputs static information based on command-line input. They consistently note the absence of suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, which is justified.\n\n### Justification:\nSince the code is purely informational, with no dynamic or untrusted data processing, the risk scores should remain at zero.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No modifications needed; the scores are appropriate.\n- The code is benign and should not be flagged for any security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward CLI script providing static package info and version details. It is free of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of zero are justified.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nAll reports align with this assessment.",
