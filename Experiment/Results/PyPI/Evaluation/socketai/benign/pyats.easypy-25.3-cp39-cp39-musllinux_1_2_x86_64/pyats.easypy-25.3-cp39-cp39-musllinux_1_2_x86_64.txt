      "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and typical for package setup. The main security consideration is ensuring the integrity of runtime.__all__. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present. The scores are consistent with the code's nature, with a slight risk due to external control of runtime.__all__."

      "conclusion": "The selected reports are thorough and cautious, correctly identifying the benign nature of the code snippets. The scoring is consistent with the analysis, with all malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and low security risk scores. No immediate threats or anomalies are evident. The conservative scores reflect limited code context but are appropriate given the benign assessments. Overall, the reports are reliable, and no modifications are necessary unless new suspicious code emerges."

The main risk depends on the trustworthiness of the external 'reporter' object, not the code itself. Scores are appropriately low, and no modifications are necessary."
