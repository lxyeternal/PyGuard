  "purpose": "The code generates tokens using the 'random' module and reads environment variables, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious activity.",
  "sources": "Environment variables and the 'random' module for token generation.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of environment variables and output tokens; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence token generation; no untrusted data flows to external systems or sensitive areas.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'random' for security-sensitive token generation is insecure but not malicious; no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing environment variables and the 'random' module. The insecure use of 'random' for token generation is a security concern but does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores reflect minor security concerns without evidence of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with a minor security concern regarding the use of 'random' for token generation. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, and malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis.",
