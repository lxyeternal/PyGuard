  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some data processing or manipulation tasks.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include input() functions, environment variables, configuration files, or external libraries that read data from network or file sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, file writes, network transmissions, or subprocess calls that may handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network, file system), passing through various processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. No unusual or suspicious function calls or code structures are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard libraries and functions. There are no signs of malicious intent such as network communication with suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or hidden code execution. The structure and formatting do not indicate obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior was observed. All functions and methods seem to serve typical data processing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard script with no suspicious activity.",
