{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to a Python package, potentially involving data processing or utility functions, but no explicit purpose can be determined from the code snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules or APIs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file I/O, or subprocess calls, though none are explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input parameters through functions, possibly to output or external modules, but no concrete flow can be confirmed without additional code context.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are immediately evident. The code structure appears straightforward with no obfuscated patterns or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard Python constructs such as imports, function definitions, and conditional statements. No signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code does not perform unsafe operations like executing system commands, network communications, or handling sensitive data insecurely. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical. The absence of hidden or malicious patterns suggests this code is benign based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears normal and does not contain indicators of supply chain attacks or malware. However, this assessment is limited by the absence of a complete code context.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
