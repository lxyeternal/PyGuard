  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and typical for package setup. The main security consideration is ensuring the integrity of runtime.__all__. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present. The scores are consistent with the code's nature, with a slight risk due to external control of runtime.__all__."
