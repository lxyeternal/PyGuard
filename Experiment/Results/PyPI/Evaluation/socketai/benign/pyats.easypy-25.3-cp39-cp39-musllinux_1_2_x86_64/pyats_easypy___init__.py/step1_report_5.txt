  "purpose": "Define package metadata, import main functionality, and expose selected objects for external use.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __contact__, __copyright__), import statements, runtime.__all__ iteration.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted input handling or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Metadata and import data flow into package namespace; dynamic attribute getter (attrgetter) used to populate globals.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute access via _attrgetter with runtime.__all__, which could be risky if runtime.__all__ is manipulated externally. No explicit input validation, but unlikely malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets package metadata and dynamically populates the global namespace with attributes retrieved from a runtime object. It imports main functions and selectively exposes them. The use of attrgetter with runtime.__all__ creates a dynamic, potentially flexible structure but does not involve untrusted input or malicious behavior. No suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module setup for a Python package, handling metadata and dynamic imports. No malicious or malicious-sounding behavior is evident. It appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
