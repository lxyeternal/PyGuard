  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code and the reasoning, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines static metadata variables (__version__, __author__, etc.).\n- Imports `_default_runtime` as `runtime` and `main` from a sibling module.\n- Uses `attrgetter` to dynamically retrieve attributes listed in `runtime.__all__`.\n- Updates the module's global namespace with these attributes.\n- Extends `__all__` with the names of these attributes for export.\n\n**Security implications:**\n- The dynamic import via `attrgetter` depends entirely on the contents of `runtime.__all__`.\n- If `runtime.__all__` is controlled or manipulated, it could lead to importing malicious or unintended attributes.\n- The code itself does not contain malicious logic, obfuscation, or external system interactions.\n- The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the `runtime` module and its `__all__`.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Finds no malicious behavior; notes reliance on the trustworthiness of `runtime`.\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. No issues detected beyond standard dynamic import risk.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar conclusion; emphasizes that dynamic attribute assignment depends on `runtime.__all__`.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious activity, just a standard pattern.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also sees standard package setup; notes that dynamic assignment is typical but depends on `runtime.__all__`.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious intent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights that if `runtime.__all__` is manipulated, it could be risky.\n- Confidence: 0.8\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0.3\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate caution, as dynamic attribute import always carries this risk.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Calls it a typical package setup; no malicious behavior found.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n- **Assessment:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.3, depending on the perceived risk of `runtime.__all__` manipulation.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- The code is standard package initialization with dynamic attribute import based on a trusted module.\n- The only real risk is if `runtime.__all__` is compromised, which could lead to malicious attributes being imported.\n- Since there's no evidence of actual malicious behavior, and the code is not obfuscated, I would assign:\n\n  - **Malware score:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n  - **Risk score:** 0.2 (moderate, due to dependency on external module integrity)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\nThe code itself is benign and typical for a Python package setup. The primary security concern hinges on the trustworthiness of the `runtime` module and its `__all__`. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malware in this snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed reports and the code's nature.",
