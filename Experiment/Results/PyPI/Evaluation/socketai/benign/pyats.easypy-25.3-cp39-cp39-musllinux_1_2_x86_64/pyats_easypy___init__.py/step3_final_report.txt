  "purpose": "Package initialization and dynamic attribute import from a trusted runtime module.",
  "sources": "Reads metadata variables, imports runtime and main, accesses runtime.__all__ for attribute names.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic attribute assignment via globals().update() based on runtime.__all__.",
  "flows": "Retrieves attribute names from runtime.__all__, uses attrgetter to get attributes from runtime, updates globals with these attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Potential risk if runtime.__all__ is manipulated; no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static metadata, imports runtime and main, and dynamically imports attributes listed in runtime.__all__ using attrgetter. This pattern relies on the trustworthiness of runtime.__all__. No malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity is detected. The primary security concern is if runtime.__all__ is compromised, malicious attributes could be imported. All reports correctly assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, with low to moderate risk scores reflecting this dependency. The code is standard for plugin architectures and appears benign assuming trusted runtime. The risk scores (around 0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the external dependency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and typical for package setup. The main security consideration is ensuring the integrity of runtime.__all__. No signs of malware or obfuscation are present. The scores are consistent with the code's nature, with a slight risk due to external control of runtime.__all__.",
