{
  "purpose": "Define module metadata and import functions and variables from a relative main module, exposing certain attributes globally.",
  "sources": "Metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __contact__, __copyright__), import statement from .main, and dynamic attribute assignment using runtime.__all__.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic attribute assignment may execute functions or access data, but no untrusted input handling or external data sources are explicitly involved.",
  "flows": "Import from .main -> dynamic attribute assignment using attrgetter on runtime.__all__ -> globals() update with these attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of globals().update with dynamically fetched attributes from runtime, which could potentially execute code if runtime.__all__ contains malicious entries, but this is controlled via __all__ from runtime.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets module metadata and imports a runtime object from a local module. It then dynamically assigns attributes from runtime.__all__ to the global namespace using attrgetter. The use of globals().update with attributes from runtime.__all__ depends on the content of runtime.__all__, which is typically controlled and safe if runtime is from a trusted source. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious network actions are present. The dynamic attribute assignment is a common pattern in plugin systems, assuming runtime.__all__ and runtime are safe and well-maintained. Overall, no malicious or maliciously obfuscated code behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with metadata and dynamic attribute assignment from a runtime object. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on its structure and content. The use of runtime.__all__ appears controlled and safe.",
