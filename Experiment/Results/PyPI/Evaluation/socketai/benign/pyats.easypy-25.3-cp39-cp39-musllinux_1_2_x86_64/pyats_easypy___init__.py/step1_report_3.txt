{
  "purpose": "Defines package metadata, imports core runtime functions, and dynamically assigns runtime attributes to the global namespace.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local main module and the operator.attrgetter function.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Imports data from internal modules, assigns attributes dynamically without external input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute assignment via globals().update() with runtime.__all__, which could potentially hide malicious or unintended behavior but is common in plugin architectures.",
  "analysis": "The code sets package metadata such as version, author, contact info, and copyright. It imports specific functions from a local module and operator. It then dynamically updates the global namespace with attributes retrieved from the runtime object for each name in runtime.__all__, which is a common pattern for plugin or extension systems. There is no evidence of hardcoded credentials, external network connections, or obfuscated/malicious code. The dynamic attribute assignment is a point to verify but is typical in such contexts. Overall, the code appears standard and benign, serving as an initialization script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script that dynamically imports attributes from a runtime object. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
