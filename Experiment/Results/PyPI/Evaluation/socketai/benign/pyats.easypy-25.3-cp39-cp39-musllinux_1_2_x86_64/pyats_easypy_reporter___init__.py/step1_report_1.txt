{
  "purpose": "Defines a decorator factory for reporting function calls conditionally based on a reporter attribute.",
  "sources": "Reads function arguments to access 'reporter' attribute and function parameters to determine condition execution.",
  "sinks": "Uses the reporter.report method within a context manager, which could potentially be misused if reporter or its methods are malicious.",
  "flows": "Function arguments -> 'reporter' attribute check -> 'report' method call within context manager.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Code appears standard for a reporting decorator.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a flexible decorator for reporting function calls. It retrieves an optional 'reporter' attribute from the first argument, applies a conditional check if provided, and wraps the function call within a reporting context. No external data sources, malicious code, or obfuscated elements are present. Usage of 'functools.wraps' ensures proper function metadata preservation. The 'report' method is invoked on the reporter object, which should be scrutinized separately for security, but its usage here is benign. The code appears to be a typical logging/reporting utility with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a conditional reporting decorator with no malicious behavior detected. It securely wraps function calls for reporting purposes and does not contain harmful logic.",
