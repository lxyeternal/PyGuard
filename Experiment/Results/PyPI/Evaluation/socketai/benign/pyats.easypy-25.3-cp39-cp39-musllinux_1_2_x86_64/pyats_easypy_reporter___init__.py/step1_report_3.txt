{
  "purpose": "Provides a decorator factory for reporting function execution, conditionally wrapping function calls with reporting context.",
  "sources": "Reads function arguments, especially the first argument to access a 'reporter' attribute, and the decorator parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes the wrapped function within a reporting context if conditions are met; no direct data leaks or external system interactions are evident.",
  "flows": "Decorator checks for 'reporter' attribute in the first argument, evaluates condition, then invokes 'reporter.report' as a context manager around the function call.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious system calls. The code performs standard decorator and reporting logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator factory 'report_func' that allows wrapping functions with a reporting context, conditional on the presence of a 'reporter' attribute in the first argument and an optional condition callable. It safely manages function wrapping with functools.wraps, and supports both parameterized and non-parameterized decorator usage. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malware-like actions are present. The use of 'with reporter.report()' appears to be a standard reporting pattern, not malicious. There are no external network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection points.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of a decorator factory for conditional reporting. No malicious intent or security risks are identified.",
