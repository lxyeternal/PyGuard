{
  "purpose": "A decorator factory that creates conditional reporting decorators which invoke a 'report' method on a 'reporter' attribute found in the first argument of the decorated function, based on an optional condition.",
  "sources": "The first argument of the decorated function, from which 'reporter' attribute is retrieved.",
  "sinks": "The 'reporter.report()' method call within a context manager, which could potentially leak data if 'reporter' is malicious.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> first argument's 'reporter' attribute -> 'reporter.report()' method (if condition is met) -> external reporting or logging system.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and uses standard patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator factory 'report_func' that creates decorators for conditional reporting. It inspects the first argument of the wrapped function for a 'reporter' attribute and, if present and the optional 'condition' evaluates to True, calls 'reporter.report()' within a context manager. The implementation is standard, with correct use of 'functools.wraps' and flexible decorator usage. No suspicious or malicious code elements are present. The potential security concern is external: if the 'reporter' object is malicious, it could leak data or perform harmful actions, but this is outside the scope of the code itself. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the external dependency risk. Overall, the code is benign and typical for logging or reporting utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of a conditional reporting decorator with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main risk depends on the trustworthiness of the external 'reporter' object, not the code itself. Scores are appropriately low, and no modifications are necessary.",
