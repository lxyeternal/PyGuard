{
  "purpose": "Provides a decorator factory to wrap functions with reporting logic, conditionally activating based on runtime conditions.",
  "sources": "Reads from function arguments to access 'args[0]' and potentially 'args[0].reporter'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'reporter.report' as a context manager to perform reporting actions.",
  "flows": "From function arguments (potentially untrusted) to the reporter.report method within the decorator wrapper.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code found. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a higher-order decorator function that wraps target functions with conditional reporting logic. It checks if the first argument has a 'reporter' attribute and whether the specified condition is met before invoking 'reporter.report' as a context manager. The implementation appears standard for logging or monitoring purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious data flow. No external or suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for conditional reporting or logging. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
