  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing, potentially related to network communication or data handling, but its exact purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from environment variables, files, or network requests (if present). Specific source functions are not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network communication functions, or data storage operations. No explicit sink functions are identified due to lack of detailed code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions through processing logic, possibly reaching output or storage functions. Exact flow paths are unclear without detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code are detected. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis shows standard Python code with typical library usage. No signs of malicious behavior like network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft are evident. The code does not perform any suspicious or dangerous operations explicitly. Without further details or context, it appears to be normal application logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no signs of malware, data leakage, or sabotage.",
