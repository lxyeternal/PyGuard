  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform standard functionality related to data processing or application logic, with no explicit malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from function parameters, user input, environment variables, or external files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file writes, system commands, or database interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks without proper validation or sanitization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution detected. No hidden backdoors or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain any obvious malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, unauthorized network connections, or backdoors. It uses standard Python constructs, and third-party libraries appear legitimate. No signs of obfuscation or malware-like activity. The code structure is typical, with clear separation between data input, processing, and output. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or operations that could leak data. All data flows seem to be contained within expected boundaries.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to perform its intended functions without compromising security.",
