  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data; only static import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed in this single import statement. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement using relative import syntax, indicating the module is part of a package. It references a 'base' module in the same package and imports 'RunInfo'. There are no other operations, data handling, or potentially malicious instructions present. Since it is a minimal import statement, it does not perform any actions that could be malicious. No signs of obfuscation or malware behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply imports a class or object from a local module. The minimal nature of the code indicates low risk.",
