  "purpose": "Import the RunInfo class from a relative module named 'base'.",
  "sources": "The code reads nothing directly; it imports a class from another module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this line.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this line only performs an import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, containing only an import statement; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a relative module. It does not process or execute untrusted data, nor does it contain any suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors. The minimal structure suggests standard practice in modular Python code.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign and appears to be a straightforward import statement with no malicious intent or security risks.",
