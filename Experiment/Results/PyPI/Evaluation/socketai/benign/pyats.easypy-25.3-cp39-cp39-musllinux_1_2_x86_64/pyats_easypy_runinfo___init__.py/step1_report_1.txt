  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow paths within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious or unusual patterns; the import is straightforward and from a local module",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing RunInfo from a relative module named .base. There are no dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or external data handling observed. Since it's a simple import, it doesn't introduce any security concerns or malicious behavior. It appears to be a normal part of Python module structuring.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard import used for code organization.",
