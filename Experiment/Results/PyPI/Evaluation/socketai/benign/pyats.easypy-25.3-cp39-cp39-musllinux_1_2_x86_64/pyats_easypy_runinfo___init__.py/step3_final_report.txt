{
  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of 'RunInfo' from a local module 'base', serving to include the 'RunInfo' class or object for use within the current module.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is the source; it reads the 'base' module in the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing 'RunInfo' from the local 'base' module; no external data or network interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is a straightforward import statement with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or embedded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal relative import statement, standard in Python projects. It does not involve dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are evident. Given the absence of suspicious activity, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no security concerns or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
