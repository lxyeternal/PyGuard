  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\nThe code in question is simply:\n\n```python\nfrom .base import RunInfo\n```\n\nThis is a straightforward relative import of a class or object named `RunInfo` from a local module `base`. There are no other operations, data flows, or external interactions.\n\n**Conclusion:** There are no security issues, malicious behaviors, or vulnerabilities present in this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Review the reasoning and summaries**\n\nAll reports agree that this is a benign, minimal import statement with no anomalies, no suspicious patterns, and no malicious intent. They correctly identify that:\n\n- No data is being processed or transmitted.\n- No dynamic code execution or obfuscation is involved.\n- The import is from a local module, which is standard practice.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the scores assigned**\n\n- **Confidence:** Mostly 1, with one report at 0.9, which is reasonable given the simplicity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code.\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious behavior.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\nSince all reports assign a risk of 0, and the code is a simple import, this is justified. No reason to increase the risk score.\n\n**Step 5: Malware score considerations**\n\nAll reports assign malware score 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\nThe reports correctly assume that a simple import statement cannot be malicious or vulnerable. No assumptions here are unjustified.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores**\n\nScores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- Given the minimal and benign nature of this code, no change in scores is necessary.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign import statement with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Overall recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and reasoning provided.",
