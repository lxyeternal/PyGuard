  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - All reports describe the code as a simple import statement: `from .base import RunInfo`.\n   - There are no other code constructs, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - The code is minimal and standard for Python modules.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code itself does not contain any vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n   - No suspicious patterns, such as dynamic execution, network activity, or embedded secrets, are present.\n   - All reports agree on benign nature.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessments.\n\n4. **Score Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n   - The security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n5. **Risk and Malware Scores**:\n   - Since the code is purely an import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior, the scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n   - The reports' scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is standard Python module import syntax.\n   - No evidence of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- Given the simplicity and benign nature, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's actual content.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a straightforward, non-malicious import statement with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
