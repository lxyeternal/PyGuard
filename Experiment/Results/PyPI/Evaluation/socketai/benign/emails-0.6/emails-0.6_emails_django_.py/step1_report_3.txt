{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning for the module 'emails.django_' and then imports all contents from a local module 'django'.",
  "sources": "The warning function call is a source of output, but it does not read external or untrusted data. The import statement pulls in code from a local module.",
  "sinks": "The import statement can load any code present in 'django', but without more context, it is a normal operation. The warning message is a benign output statement.",
  "flows": "There is no data flow from external untrusted sources to sinks. The warning does not affect data flow, and the import is a static code inclusion.",
  "anomalies": "The warning message indicates a deprecated module, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply issues a deprecation warning about a module relocation and imports all contents from a local module 'django'. There are no inputs from external sources, no data manipulation, and no suspicious operations. The code's purpose appears to be maintenance-related. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, maintenance-related code snippet that issues a deprecation warning and imports a module. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present.",
