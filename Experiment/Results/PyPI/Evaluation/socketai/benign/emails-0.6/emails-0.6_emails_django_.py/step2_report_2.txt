  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their claims, and evaluate the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe similar code: issuing a DeprecationWarning and then importing from a local or relative module.\n- The code is minimal, straightforward, and typical for deprecation handling.\n- No external data, secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are mentioned.\n- The import statements could execute code from the imported modules, but nothing in the snippets suggests malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk) are all zero or very low, aligning with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and logical assessments:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code functions as a deprecation notice and import. No issues are evident.\n   - The import could execute code, but this is standard behavior, not malicious.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or flaws are present.\n   - The code could be improved by avoiding wildcard imports (`from .django import *`), but this is not a security concern per se.\n\n3. **Scores evaluation:**\n   - Malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are zero, as no obfuscation is present.\n   - Risk scores are very low (0.1 or 0), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - No report warrants a high risk score; the code is standard maintenance code.\n   - The highest risk score is 0.1, which is reasonable.\n\n5. **Malware considerations:**\n   - No malware activity is suggested or detected.\n   - The import could theoretically include malicious code if the imported module is malicious, but there's no evidence here.\n\n6. **Assumption-based vulnerability claims:**\n   - No claims based on assumptions are present; all analyses are consistent with the code shown.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores align with the described code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0; no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, around 0.1, reflecting the benign, maintenance nature of the code.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\nGiven the uniformity and the analysis, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the import potentially executing code, but this is standard and not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet is a standard deprecation pattern with no security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
