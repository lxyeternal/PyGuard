{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning for a module and imports all contents from the 'django' submodule.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only generates a warning.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks where untrusted data could cause harm or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as there are no inputs processed or outputs generated based on untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, malicious code, or obfuscated constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The script is minimal and straightforward. It only warns about module relocation and imports a submodule. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are evident. The import statement could potentially include malicious code if the imported module itself is malicious, but based solely on this code, no malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious intent. It simply warns about a module move and imports another module. There is no evidence of malware or security risks in this snippet.",
