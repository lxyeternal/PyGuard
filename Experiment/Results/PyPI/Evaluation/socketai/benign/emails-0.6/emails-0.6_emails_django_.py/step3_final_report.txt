{
  "purpose": "Issue a deprecation warning and import a local module, typical for handling deprecated code paths.",
  "sources": "The warning message is generated at runtime; the import statement loads code from a local module (.django).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs; the import could execute code from the imported module, but none is present here.",
  "flows": "The warning is issued during module load; the import executes the code in the 'django' module, which could contain further code execution if malicious, but none is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with a deprecation warning and a standard import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a DeprecationWarning to inform users about module relocation, then imports from a local module. There is no external input, network activity, or obfuscation. The import could execute code if the imported module is malicious, but the snippet itself is benign. The warning is standard practice. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and the absence of external data sources suggest a very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard deprecation pattern with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The import is from a local module, and the warning is benign. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code is safe for use.",
