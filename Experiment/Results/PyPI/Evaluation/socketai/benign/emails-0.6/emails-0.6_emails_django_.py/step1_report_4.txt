There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors. The warning is standard practice for deprecated modules, and the import statement is typical. No anomalies or malicious activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to notify users of a module move and perform a standard import. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
