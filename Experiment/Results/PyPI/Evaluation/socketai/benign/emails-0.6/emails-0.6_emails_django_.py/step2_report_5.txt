  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, the accuracy of the scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as issuing a deprecation warning and then importing a module or submodule.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are mentioned.\n- The code is minimal, standard, and common in package maintenance scenarios.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, and the obfuscated score is 0, indicating no signs of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Potential Issues:\n- The code snippet does **not** contain any malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n- The import statement (`from .django import *`) could execute code if the `django` module contains malicious code, but this is not evident from the snippet.\n- The deprecation warning is standard practice and does not introduce security risks.\n\n### Error or Flaws in the Reports:\n- **No errors or flaws** are apparent in the logical reasoning or summaries.\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard, maintenance-related, and benign.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Very low (0 or 0.1), justified by the lack of external input, network activity, or suspicious code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **security risk scores** could be slightly adjusted upward if considering the import of potentially malicious modules, but since the code is only importing from a local module, 0 or 0.1 remains appropriate.\n- The **malware score** should stay at 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- The **obfuscated score** should remain at 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal inherent risk of import statements, but not malicious)\n\nThis code snippet is a standard deprecation warning followed by a module import, common in package maintenance, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed in the scoring.\n- The overall security assessment is that this code is benign, with no malware or obfuscation, and minimal security risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, with a slight acknowledgment that the risk score could be marginally increased to 0.1 for the import operation, but it's not necessary.",
