{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning about a module move and then imports all contents from a submodule.",
  "sources": "The code reads the warning message string and performs an import from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "The import could potentially bring in any code from the submodule, but no direct data leak or external communication occurs here.",
  "flows": "The warning string is created, then a deprecation warning is issued, followed by importing the submodule's contents.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies. The warning message is benign and standard. The import statement is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a DeprecationWarning with a message about module relocation, which is a common practice during module updates. It then imports all contents from a submodule within the same package. No input reading, no external data handling, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The code is minimal and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet performs a standard deprecation warning and a package import with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
