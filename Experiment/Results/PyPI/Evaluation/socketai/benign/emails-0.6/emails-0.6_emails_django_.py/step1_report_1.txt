{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning for the 'emails.django_' module and then imports everything from the '.django' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module metadata and executes an import statement from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "The import statement could potentially bring in code that executes upon import, but without additional context, this is standard behavior.",
  "flows": "The warning is triggered first, then the import from the relative module occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the warning and import are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a DeprecationWarning indicating that 'emails.django_' has been moved to 'emails.django'. This is a common practice for package deprecation notices. After issuing the warning, it imports all contents from a relative module '.django'. The import could potentially execute code contained in that module, but nothing in this fragment suggests malicious intent. There are no suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code appears to be a standard deprecation pattern with a simple import.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical deprecation warning followed by a module import. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
