  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the security implications.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet, which issues a deprecation warning and then imports from a local module.\n- The code is straightforward, with no external input, data manipulation, or network activity.\n- The main concern is whether the import could bring malicious code, but nothing in the code snippet suggests malicious intent.\n- The warning is standard practice for deprecation notices.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies the warning and import.\n- **Analysis:** Accurately states that the import could execute code, but there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (low, as it’s a benign warning and import)\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes that the import could bring in code, but nothing suspicious.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with previous assessments; no external data, no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, just a deprecation warning and import.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Analysis:** Same conclusion; no malicious activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and recommendations:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code snippet is as described; it does issue a deprecation warning and performs an import. No malicious code or obfuscation is evident.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code snippet.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** Given the benign nature, a low risk score (~0.1) is appropriate.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- The import could execute malicious code if the imported module ('django') is compromised, but there's no evidence of that here.\n- The deprecation warning itself is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard deprecation pattern)\n\n**Overall, the reports are consistent and accurate. No changes are necessary.**",
