  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms that the code only imports an exception class and defines three simple custom exceptions.\n- No data flow, sinks, or sources that could lead to malicious activity.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the benign nature of class definitions and import.\n- No external effects or data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates that the code only imports and defines exception classes.\n- No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same pattern: straightforward class definitions, no data processing.\n- No anomalies or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Consistent with previous reports; standard exception class definitions and import.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?** No. All reports confirm that the code only imports and defines exception classes with no data handling or external communication.\n- **Obfuscation?** No. The code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All are set to 0, which aligns with the analysis. No reason to increase these scores.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly at 0, as no malicious behavior is observed.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the code is benign.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the reports.\n- The code is benign, with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The analysis is thorough and aligns with the evidence.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code fragment is a standard, harmless part of a larger codebase, serving solely to define exception classes and import an exception. No security concerns are present here.",
