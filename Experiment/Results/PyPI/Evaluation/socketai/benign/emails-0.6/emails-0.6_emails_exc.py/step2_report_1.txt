  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes and importing a specific exception from a local module.\n- No data processing, input handling, network communication, or external effects are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n   - Importing an exception class from a local package and defining custom exceptions is standard practice.\n   - No evidence of code that could be exploited or that performs malicious actions.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no logical flaws or misinterpretations.\n   - No errors are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which seems reasonable given the code.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely defining exception classes and importing a class from a local module, there's no basis for assigning a risk higher than 0.\n   - No malicious activity, no external data handling, no security-sensitive operations.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious behavior is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Estimated malware score:** 0\n- **Estimated obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Estimated security risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code fragment is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or security-sensitive behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the provided reports and my analysis, I concur with the assessments. The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores reflect this accurately.",
