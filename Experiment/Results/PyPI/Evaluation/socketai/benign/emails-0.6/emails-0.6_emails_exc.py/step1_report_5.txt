  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to HTTP loading, header parsing, and message completeness.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .packages.dkim import DKIMException",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or processing occurs within this code",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only defines classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple exception classes and imports a DKIMException class from a relative package. The import appears legitimate for handling email or DKIM-related errors. No user input, network activity, or data processing is present. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment appears to be a standard, benign part of a larger project, responsible for defining exception classes and importing necessary modules. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
