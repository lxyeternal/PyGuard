  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and import a specific exception from a module related to DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail).",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.packages.dkim' module, class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no external input/output, no security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; standard exception definitions and import.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific exception from a local module and defines three custom exception classes, all of which inherit from standard Python exception classes. There is no handling of input data, network operations, or any other security-sensitive actions. The code appears to be part of a larger application or library and contains no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defining exception classes and importing a specific exception. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this fragment.",
