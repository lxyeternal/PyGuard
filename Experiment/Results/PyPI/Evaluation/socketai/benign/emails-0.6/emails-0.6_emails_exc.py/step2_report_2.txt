  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code snippets, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code consists solely of import statements and class definitions for exceptions.\n- No data processing, input handling, network communication, or external effects are present.\n- The import path '.packages.dkim' suggests a local package structure, likely part of a larger project.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies are evident.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk score is 0, which seems appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Potential Issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code?**  \n  **No.** The code is straightforward, defining exception classes and importing an exception class. No vulnerabilities or malicious activity are evident.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The code appears correct and idiomatic for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n\n- **Scores suggested by the reports:**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and securityRisk = 0, which is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The **purpose** in each report is accurate: defining custom exceptions and importing a specific exception class.\n- The **sources** and **sinks** are correctly identified as only import statements and class definitions, with no data flow or external effects.\n- The **analysis** in each report correctly notes the benign nature and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n### Justification of scores:\n\n- The **malware score** of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- The **securityRisk** score of 0 is justified given the code's simplicity and lack of vulnerabilities.\n- The **obfuscated** score of 0 is correct, as there's no obfuscation.\n\n### Potential adjustments:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the entire code segment and the reports, I agree with the provided scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n**However,** if I were to assign a risk score based solely on the code's context, I might consider a **risk score of 0.1** as a minimal baseline for imported modules, but since the code is harmless, 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns.**\n- **Scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.**\n- **No changes needed.**\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\nThis reflects the benign, straightforward nature of the code snippet.",
