  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions and a single import statement.\n- No data flows, input handling, external communication, or processing are present.\n- The import path suggests a local package structure, likely part of a larger project.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are all zero, which aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis per report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- Purpose: Explains that the code defines exception classes and imports a DKIMException.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity or security issues.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n- SecurityRisk: 0 (no security impact)  \n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing benign class definitions and import.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Again, straightforward class definitions and import statement, no data handling.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same pattern: class definitions, import, no data flow.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar to previous, no suspicious activity.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and final assessment:\n\n- The code is a minimal, standard pattern for defining custom exceptions and importing a specific exception class.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nIt's essential to review the entire codebase to ensure no malicious activity exists elsewhere. However, based solely on this fragment, the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
