  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to HTTP loading, headers, and message completeness.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'DKIMException' from a local package '.packages.dkim'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or potential data leak points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code primarily defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no complex logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific exception class from a local package, then defines three simple custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exception types. There are no inputs, data processing, or output operations. The exception classes are standard and serve as error identifiers. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present, and no external communication or data handling occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic module defining custom exceptions for error handling with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears safe and standard in design.",
