  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions and a single import statement.\n- No data flows, no input/output, no network or external interactions.\n- The import path suggests a package structure related to DKIM or email handling, but the code itself does not perform any operations.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of this code fragment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. The code is straightforward and does not contain vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- **Logical flaws:** None. The class definitions are standard, and the import is legitimate.\n- **Reasoning errors:** No errors or misconceptions are apparent in the reports.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, correctly indicating no security issues.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code only defines exception classes and imports a specific exception, there is no attack surface or vulnerability.\n- The import path does not suggest any malicious intent; it appears to be part of a larger, legitimate project.\n- No evidence of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious code.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- No such claims are made in the reports; all are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code fragment is standard, safe, and does not pose any security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is straightforward, with no security concerns.",
