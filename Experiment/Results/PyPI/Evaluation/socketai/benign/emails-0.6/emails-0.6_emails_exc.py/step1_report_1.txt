  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and imports a specific exception from a package, likely for email or DKIM-related error handling.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.packages.dkim' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports an exception class and declares three simple custom exception classes with no additional logic, data handling, or external communication. The import path suggests it is part of a larger package structure, and no malicious activity or security issues are apparent in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defining custom exception classes and importing a specific exception. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks in this code segment.",
