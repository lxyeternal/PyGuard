  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to HTTP loading, header validation, message completeness, and DKIM operations.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing DKIMException from a local packages.dkim module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow as there are only class definitions and an import statement; no input or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements are present. The code is straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific exception from a local module and defines three custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions. There are no input sources, data processing, or external interactions; it solely establishes exception classes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of class definitions and a single import statement for an exception class. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or security risks.",
