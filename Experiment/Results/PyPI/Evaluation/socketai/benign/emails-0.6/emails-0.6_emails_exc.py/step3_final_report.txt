{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and imports a specific exception from a local package, serving as part of error handling in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .packages.dkim and class definitions for exceptions",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external outputs present",
  "flows": "None; code consists solely of class definitions and import statements without data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class and import definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of import of a local exception class and definition of three custom exception classes. There are no data inputs, external communications, or security-sensitive operations. The import path suggests a local package structure, likely for email or DKIM handling, but the code itself does not perform any actions or processing. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is standard and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module defining exception classes and importing a local exception. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
