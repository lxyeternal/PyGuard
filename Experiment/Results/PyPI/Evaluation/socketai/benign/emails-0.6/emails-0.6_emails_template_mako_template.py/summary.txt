  "conclusion": "The code is a standard template handler with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The primary concern is rendering untrusted templates, which can lead to code execution. Scores are consistent with this risk; malware and obfuscation are absent, but the potential for malicious activity exists if input is untrusted."
