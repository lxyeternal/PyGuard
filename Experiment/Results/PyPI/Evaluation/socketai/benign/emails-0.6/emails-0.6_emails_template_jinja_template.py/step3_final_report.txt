  "purpose": "A wrapper class for handling Jinja2 templates, primarily for demo or extension purposes.",
  "sources": "Template text input and environment parameter during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Rendering output via self.template.render with provided keyword arguments.",
  "flows": "Input template text and context data flow into the environment's from_string method, then into the render method.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'globals()' to dynamically import 'jinja2' is unconventional but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that manages Jinja2 templates, importing 'jinja2' dynamically if not already imported. It provides methods to compile and render templates. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main security concern is the potential for template injection if untrusted input is rendered, which is inherent in templating engines but not specific to this code. The dynamic import via 'globals()' is unusual but benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk scores) are consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious template handler with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the inherent risk of rendering untrusted data, which is typical for templating systems. The scores and assessments in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
