  "purpose": "The code defines the main module for a Python email library, providing functions for building and sending email messages, with support for attachments, signatures, and templates.",
  "sources": "No external input sources directly within this snippet; imports and module-level constants are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted input; message construction and static attribute definitions only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical operations within this code snippet; no network or data processing flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is primarily declarative and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of module metadata, constant definitions, and import statements for key components of the email library. There is no user input handling, no network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured library setup with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization file for an email library, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves as an entry point to import core functionalities for email message creation and sending.",
