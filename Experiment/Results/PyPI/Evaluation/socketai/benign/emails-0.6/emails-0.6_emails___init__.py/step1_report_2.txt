  "purpose": "This code provides a library for building and sending emails, including features like DKIM signing, templating, and attachment handling.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules from its own package (.message, .utils), and sets a USER_AGENT string. No input or data reading occurs in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network or file operations are directly invoked in this snippet. External data interactions occur in other parts of the package, not shown here.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this snippet; it primarily defines constants, imports, and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets (beyond USER_AGENT string which is benign), or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily package metadata, constant definitions, and import statements. No input, output, or executable logic is present that could pose security risks or malicious behavior. The structure and content are standard for a Python package module, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a typical library setup file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as part of an email handling library, with no suspicious or harmful code elements.",
