{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a Python library for constructing and sending emails, including features like DKIM signatures and templating.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module attributes, imports from internal modules (.message, .utils), and uses a string formatting for USER_AGENT.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or external data transmissions within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code does not contain runtime data flows; it primarily defines constants and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. All code appears to be standard library setup and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward module initialization file that sets up metadata and imports components for email message handling. It does not perform any input/output operations, data processing, or network activity here. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a library initializer with no malicious or suspicious features detected. It functions as part of a larger email handling library and contains no harmful behaviors.",
