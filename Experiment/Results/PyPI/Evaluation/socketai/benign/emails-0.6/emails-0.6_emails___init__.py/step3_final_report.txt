{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initialization and metadata setup for the 'emails' Python library, defining package information, user agent string, and importing core components.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from module-level variable assignments (__title__, __version__, etc.) and imports from internal modules (.message, .utils).",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process user input, network data, or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code only assigns constants and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, declarative module defining metadata and importing core components. It contains no runtime data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are evident. The consistent reports confirm its benign nature, with all assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features indicate a very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard library initialization module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
