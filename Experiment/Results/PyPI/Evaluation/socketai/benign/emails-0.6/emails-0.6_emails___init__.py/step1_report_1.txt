{
  "purpose": "The source code serves as a Python library for constructing and sending email messages with additional features like DKIM, templating, and integration with web frameworks.",
  "sources": "Input sources include user-provided data such as email content, attachments (from files), recipient addresses, SMTP server configurations, and optional message templates.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include sending email via SMTP, loading files for attachments, and constructing email headers and bodies. No untrusted data flows are explicitly identified to sensitive system components.",
  "flows": "Data flows from user inputs (email content, attachments, SMTP config) through message construction and then to SMTP sending functions. No clear malicious flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard library setup with imports and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines metadata and imports from internal modules (.message, .utils). There are no input handling, data processing, or network communication operations directly visible in this fragment. No suspicious or malicious constructs are evident. The code is consistent with a typical open-source library setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard library initialization and metadata file. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are evident. The overall security risk is very low.",
