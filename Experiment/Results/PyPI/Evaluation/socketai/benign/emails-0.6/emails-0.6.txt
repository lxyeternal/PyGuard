      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module defining exception classes and importing a local exception. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module with no malicious payloads or sabotage. The primary security issue is the insecure SSL verification pattern, which should be addressed but does not indicate malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the insecure SSL verification but not malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-designed for its purpose, and contains no signs of malware or malicious intent. The potential security risk stems from external resource loading, which can be controlled via trusted loader functions. The current low scores are justified and appropriate."

It is transparent, well-implemented, and poses minimal security risk. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified given its cryptographic nature and proper key handling."

The primary security consideration is the inherent risk of rendering untrusted data, which is typical for templating systems. The scores and assessments in the reports are appropriate and justified."

Scores are consistent with this risk; malware and obfuscation are absent, but the potential for malicious activity exists if input is untrusted."
