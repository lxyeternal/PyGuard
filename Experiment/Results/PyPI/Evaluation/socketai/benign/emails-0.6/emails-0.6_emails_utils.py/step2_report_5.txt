  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for email handling, URL fetching, etc.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are standard; no suspicious data exfiltration.  \n- **Anomalies:** No secrets; use of `verify=False` in requests is insecure but not malicious.  \n- **Analysis:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The only security concern is SSL verification being disabled, which is a common but insecure practice.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malware or malicious intent detected. The risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate, given the insecure SSL setting.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — **reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, URL fetching, email parsing.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evident malicious data flow.  \n- **Anomalies:** Same as above, `verify=False` is insecure but not malicious.  \n- **Analysis:** No signs of backdoors or malicious code; standard utility code.  \n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, no malware.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — **appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for email and HTTP requests.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flow; functions handle untrusted data benignly.  \n- **Anomalies:** Same pattern, `verify=False`.  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; standard utility functions.  \n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — **reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Email and URL utilities, DNS caching.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flow.  \n- **Anomalies:** Same as above, insecure SSL verification.  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent, just utility code.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malware detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — **appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, URL requests, email handling.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flow.  \n- **Anomalies:** Same concern about `verify=False`.  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; standard utility code.  \n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — **reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious payloads or behaviors.  \n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk Score:** The consistent use of `verify=False` in requests is a security concern but not malicious. The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting a minor security issue rather than a serious threat.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is standard utility code for email and HTTP handling.  \n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flow.  \n- The only concern is insecure SSL verification, which is a known security risk but not malicious in itself.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (due to `verify=False`)  \n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears benign, with a minor security concern that should be addressed but does not indicate any supply chain compromise or malicious intent.",
