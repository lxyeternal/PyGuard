  "purpose": "Utility functions for email processing, header encoding/decoding, message ID generation, URL fetching, and DNS caching, primarily for email applications.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, function parameters, external URLs, and email headers.",
  "sinks": "Email message objects, HTTP responses, formatted headers, and DNS hostname cache.",
  "flows": "Input data (headers, URLs, addresses) flows through encoding, parsing, and network requests without evident malicious manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'verify=False' in requests disables SSL verification, which is insecure but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions for email and HTTP handling, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The only security concern is the disabling of SSL verification in network requests, which could be exploited in man-in-the-middle attacks but does not constitute malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. The code structure is straightforward and uses standard libraries, indicating benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module with no malicious payloads or sabotage. The primary security issue is the insecure SSL verification pattern, which should be addressed but does not indicate malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the insecure SSL verification but not malicious intent.",
