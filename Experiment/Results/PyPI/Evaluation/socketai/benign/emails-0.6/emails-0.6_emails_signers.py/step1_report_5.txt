{
  "purpose": "Provides functionality to sign emails with DKIM signatures using a private key.",
  "sources": "Reads private key input (privkey or file read), message content (message or message_string).",
  "sinks": "Uses the dkim.sign function to generate DKIM signatures, which then are inserted into email headers.",
  "flows": "Private key input -> parse_pem_private_key -> dkim.sign -> insertion into email headers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code handles keys and message signing securely, with error handling for key parsing and signing errors.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes with a private key, either directly or from a file, then parses it securely. The signing functions invoke the pydkim library to generate signatures and insert them into email headers or message strings. Error handling is present. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The code appears to perform legitimate DKIM signing operations without obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements DKIM signing functionality with appropriate key handling and error management. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security issues are detected. It appears to be a standard, legitimate email signing utility.",
