{
  "purpose": "This code provides functionality for signing email messages with DKIM signatures using a private key.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'key' or 'privkey' parameter, message strings passed to sign_message and sign_message_string methods, and potentially message objects with as_string method.",
  "sinks": "The code generates DKIM signature headers that are inserted into email messages. It does not send data over the network or access external resources directly.",
  "flows": "Private key (source) is parsed and used to generate signatures (sink) which are inserted into email headers. Message data flows from input methods to the signing functions, resulting in modified message objects or strings.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls. The code properly handles private key parsing and error handling. No obfuscated code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard DKIM signing procedures, including parsing private keys, generating signature strings, and inserting headers into email messages. It performs appropriate error handling for key parsing failures. The use of external libraries (dkim module) appears conventional. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors is detected. All data flows seem aligned with expected cryptographic signing operations. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard implementation of DKIM signing for emails. It handles private key input securely, performs signing correctly, and does not contain malicious code or suspicious behavior. No security risks are identified based on this code alone.",
