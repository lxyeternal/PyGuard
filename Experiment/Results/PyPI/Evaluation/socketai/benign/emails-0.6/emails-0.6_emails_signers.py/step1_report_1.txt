{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class for signing email messages with DKIM signatures using the pydkim library.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters such as 'message', 'message_string', and files via 'privkey.read()'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to email message headers ('msg._headers.insert') and returns signed message strings.",
  "flows": "Reads private key and message input, processes them, and produces signed messages or headers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. Uses external library for cryptography. No suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles private keys, including reading from file objects, and performs email signing with DKIM. It uses established cryptographic functions, catches exceptions properly, and does not perform any insecure operations. No hardcoded secrets or network connections are present. The signing process involves standard cryptographic practices, with no obfuscation or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of DKIM email signing. It properly manages cryptographic keys and message signing, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
