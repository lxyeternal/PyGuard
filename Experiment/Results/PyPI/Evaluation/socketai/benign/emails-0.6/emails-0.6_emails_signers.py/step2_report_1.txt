  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the accuracy of their assessments and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as a DKIM signer, reading private keys and message data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Appropriately identifies insertion into email headers and message signing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Uses standard cryptographic practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, high confidence (0.9), no malware, low security risk (0.2).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is a standard DKIM signing implementation with no malicious or suspicious features.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes private key reading and message processing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Appropriately traces data flow into `dkim.sign()` with the private key.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation. Exception handling is appropriate.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9), no malware, low risk (0.1).\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a legitimate DKIM signer with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code signs emails with DKIM, reading keys and message data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly describes data flow into `dkim.sign()` and header insertion.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or network activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, high confidence (0.9), no malware, low risk (0.2).\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is sound; the code appears standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes input sources and signing process.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly details key parsing and signature insertion.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9), no malware, very low risk (0.1).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is a typical DKIM signing utility.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes key and message input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Appropriately traces data flow into `dkim.sign()` and header insertion.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, external calls, or malicious behaviors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate, high confidence (0.9), no malware, low risk (0.2).\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly characterizes the code as standard and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency & Final Judgment\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation but generally low, reflecting the code's nature as a cryptographic utility without external dependencies or network activity.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of DKIM signing, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (code is clear and understandable)\n- **Risk:** **0.1–0.2** (low, due to cryptographic handling, but always consider key management as a minor risk factor)\n\n**Overall:** The supply chain risk for this dependency is minimal. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard DKIM signing implementation with no malicious or obfuscated features. The scores provided in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
