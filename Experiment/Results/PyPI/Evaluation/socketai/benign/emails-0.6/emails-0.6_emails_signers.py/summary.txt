  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of DKIM signing with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is transparent, well-implemented, and poses minimal security risk. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified given its cryptographic nature and proper key handling."
