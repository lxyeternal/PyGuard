  "purpose": "Implements DKIM email signing by parsing private keys and inserting DKIM headers into email messages.",
  "sources": "Reads private key from file-like objects or strings; processes email message data for signing.",
  "sinks": "Inserts DKIM signature headers into email message headers; signs message strings or message objects.",
  "flows": "Private key data flows from input to cryptographic parsing; message data flows into signing functions; resulting signature header is inserted into message headers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard cryptographic practices used.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard DKIM signing using the 'dkim' library, handling private keys securely, with proper error handling. It signs email messages or message strings, inserting the DKIM header at the top of message headers. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and follows best practices for cryptographic signing. The exception handling for key parsing and signing errors is appropriate. No suspicious patterns or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of DKIM signing with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It is transparent, well-implemented, and poses minimal security risk. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified given its cryptographic nature and proper key handling.",
