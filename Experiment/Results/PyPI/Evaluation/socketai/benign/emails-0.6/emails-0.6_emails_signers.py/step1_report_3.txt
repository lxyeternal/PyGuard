{
  "purpose": "The code provides functionality for DKIM signing of email messages to ensure authenticity and integrity.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters such as 'message', 'message_string', and 'privkey'; also reads 'key' or 'privkey' arguments during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'dkim.sign' function to generate DKIM signatures, which process the message content. Does not directly write or transmit data but generates signatures that could be inserted into emails.",
  "flows": "Input data from message or message string flows into 'get_sign_string' which calls 'dkim.sign', and then the resulting signature is inserted into email headers or returned as string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code follows typical email signing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes DKIM signing with provided keys and parameters, handling private key parsing securely. It signs messages by calling a standard signing library and inserts signatures into email headers or returns signed strings. No external data is fetched or sent over networks, and no hardcoded secrets are present. Error handling appears appropriate, with options to ignore sign errors. The flow is straightforward and aligns with expected DKIM signing practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of DKIM signing for email messages, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected cryptographic signing tasks without suspicious activity.",
