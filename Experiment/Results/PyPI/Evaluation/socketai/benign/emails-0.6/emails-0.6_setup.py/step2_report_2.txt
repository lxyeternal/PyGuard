  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Describes the setup script for the 'emails' package, including testing and auditing.\n- **Sources:** Reads version info from `__init__.py`, uses system args, imports modules.\n- **Sinks:** Executes system commands (`python setup.py sdist upload`) and runs static analysis (`PyFlakes`).\n- **Flows:** Command-line triggers, file reads, imports.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; the publish command could be misused if manipulated, but no malicious intent is evident.\n- **Analysis:** Standard setup script with static analysis; no malicious payloads or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, well-structured, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (low, due to potential misuse of `os.system` but no actual malicious activity)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a setup script with static analysis.\n- No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malware.\n- The only minor concern is executing external commands via system calls, but within normal scope.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (negligible)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Same overall conclusion: standard setup script, with `os.system` for publishing.\n- No malicious code, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- Slightly higher risk score (0.2) due to `os.system` usage, but still considered low.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Reiterates that the script is a typical setup with static analysis.\n- The `os.system` command is noted but considered controlled.\n- No malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same conclusion: standard setup with no malicious intent.\n- No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- The static analysis and package setup are typical.\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None. The code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero mainly due to the use of `os.system` for publishing, which can be risky if manipulated, but in this context, it appears controlled and standard.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscated code.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, due to reliance on system commands; typical for setup scripts, but should be noted.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent. The minor risk associated with executing system commands is standard in such scripts and does not constitute a security threat in this context.\n\n---\n\nIf you have further questions or need a more detailed breakdown, let me know!",
