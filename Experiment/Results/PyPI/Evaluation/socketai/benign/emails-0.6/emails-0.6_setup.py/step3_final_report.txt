  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'emails' Python package, including version extraction, static analysis, and publishing commands.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from __init__.py, system arguments, imports modules, reads files for setup, executes system commands for publishing.",
  "sinks": "Executes 'python setup.py sdist upload' via os.system, runs static analysis with PyFlakes, imports modules, reads files.",
  "flows": "Command-line triggers the publish command, static analysis runs on source files, version info read from files, setup functions called.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system for publishing, no secrets or obfuscation, no hidden code, no suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with an auxiliary static analysis command. The 'publish' command executes a fixed system call, which could be exploited if manipulated but is typical in package publishing scripts. The static analysis tool is benign. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The version extraction via regex is straightforward but fragile. Overall, the script is benign, with minimal security risks mainly associated with executing system commands, which is common in such scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, well-structured setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The minor risk stems from executing system commands, which is standard but should be used cautiously. Scores are consistent with this assessment.",
