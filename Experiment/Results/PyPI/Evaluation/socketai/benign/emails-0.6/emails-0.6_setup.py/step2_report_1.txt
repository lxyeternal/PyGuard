  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup script with code audit feature.\n- Sources: Reads package files, system args, imports.\n- Sinks: Executes system commands for publishing, imports modules.\n- Flows: Command-line triggers, file reads, imports.\n- Anomalies: No secrets, no obfuscation, benign audit.\n- Analysis: No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The 'publish' command executes a fixed system command, which is typical but could be risky if manipulated—though no malicious intent is evident.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard package setup with code audit. Risk score: **0.1** (negligible), Malware: **0**.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Package setup with build and audit.\n- Sources: System args, files.\n- Sinks: System command for publish, static analysis.\n- Flows: Command-line triggers, file reads.\n- Anomalies: No secrets, no obfuscation, benign.\n- Analysis: No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The static analysis is standard.\n- Conclusion: Safe, minimal risk. Risk: **0.1**, Malware: **0**.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Setup script with build and audit.\n- Sources: Args, files, modules.\n- Sinks: 'os.system' for publish, static analysis.\n- Flows: Command triggers, file reads.\n- Anomalies: Use of 'os.system' could be risky if manipulated, but in context, it's controlled.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior detected; standard practices.\n- Conclusion: Safe, low risk. Risk: **0.2** (slightly higher due to 'os.system'), Malware: **0**.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Setup and utility script with audit.\n- Sources: Args, files.\n- Sinks: 'os.system' for publish, static analysis.\n- Flows: Command-line, file reads.\n- Anomalies: Same concern about 'os.system', but typical.\n- Analysis: No malicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Conclusion: Safe, minimal risk. Risk: **0.2**, Malware: **0**.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup with static analysis.\n- Sources: Args, files.\n- Sinks: 'os.system' for publish, static analysis.\n- Flows: Command-line, file reads.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis: No malicious activity; typical setup script.\n- Conclusion: Safe, no malware. Risk: **0**, Malware: **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious code. The use of 'os.system' for publishing is standard but could be exploited if modified maliciously, yet in the current context, it is benign.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected across all reports.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher where 'os.system' is used, but overall, the code is standard and safe.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** to **0.2** (due to use of 'os.system' for publishing, but no malicious intent)\n\n**Final conclusion:** The code is a typical setup script with an auxiliary static analysis feature. No malicious activity, backdoors, or malware detected. The minor risk stems from executing system commands, which is standard in setup scripts but should be used cautiously.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nAll reports are consistent with this assessment.",
