  "purpose": "Define a Field class for parsing and representing data fields with various types and attributes.",
  "sources": "Toks input parameter (data dictionary), self attributes, and input string in parse method.",
  "sinks": "Conversion to int or float in parse method, which could raise exceptions if input is maliciously crafted but not inherently unsafe.",
  "flows": "Input string passed to parse method, converted based on datatype, with potential exception if input is malformed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval-like conversions (int, float) could raise exceptions on malicious input but are standard conversions. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious constants detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Field object based on tokens, setting attributes for data type, length, precision, and other properties. It raises exceptions if data types are unknown or invalid. The parse method converts input strings to int, float, or returns string, depending on type. No external inputs or outputs appear vulnerable; the conversions are straightforward. No evidence of malicious intent such as network activity, file operations, or obfuscated code. The code performs data validation and conversion but does not contain any malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data parsing class with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It performs data validation and type conversion securely within expected parameters.",
