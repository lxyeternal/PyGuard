  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, static pyparsing-based parser for COBOL copybook data. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low risk score assigned in the reports is appropriate. The parser is safe for use, assuming imported functions are secure. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is free of malicious intent."
