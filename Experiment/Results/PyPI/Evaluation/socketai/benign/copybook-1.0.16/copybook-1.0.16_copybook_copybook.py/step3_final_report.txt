{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to parse files or strings into FieldGroup objects and restructure them into hierarchical tree structures for further processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data read from files via parseFile, or from strings via parseString.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data exfiltration points; data is processed internally into data structures.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from parseFile/parseString into _post_process, passing through _list_to_tree and _relocate_field functions, with copies made to avoid shared references.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of copy.copy() is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward parser and tree builder for FieldGroup objects, with functions to normalize and position fields. It relies on external modules (stmt, FieldGroup) and performs no network, file writing, or code execution. Static analysis shows no malicious intent or security flaws; the use of copy.copy() is appropriate for tree restructuring. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. External modules' safety cannot be guaranteed but are outside the scope of this static review. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data parsing and restructuring utility with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the static analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
