{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse files or strings into a hierarchical tree structure of FieldGroup objects, possibly for configuration or data schema processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from filename in parse_file() and string contents in parse_string().",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or security effects; no network, file writing, or execution functions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input (filename or string) into parsing functions, then into post-processing functions that restructure the data into a tree.",
  "anomalies": "Use of copy.copy() for copying objects; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data parsing and restructuring, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The functions accept input data and process it into hierarchical structures. There are no network calls, file writes, or system modifications. The use of copy.copy() is standard for avoiding shared references and does not suggest malicious intent. No hidden backdoors or malicious code patterns are detected. The code appears clean, purpose-specific, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard parser and tree builder for FieldGroup objects with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely manipulates data structures and does not perform any harmful actions.",
