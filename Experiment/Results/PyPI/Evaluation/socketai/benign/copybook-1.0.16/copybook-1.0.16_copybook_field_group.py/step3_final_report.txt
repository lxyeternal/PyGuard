  "purpose": "Manage hierarchical field groups with position calculation, normalization, renaming, and flattening functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in __init__, child elements, and internal methods accessing self.children and self.redefine_target.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; internal data manipulations are contained within the class.",
  "flows": "Methods like calculate_positions, _normalize_reoccurs, and _rename_with_suffix process self.children and modify their attributes; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of deepcopy is standard for cloning nested structures.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a hierarchical data structure with position calculations, reoccurs normalization, renaming, and flattening. It uses standard Python idioms, such as deepcopy and list manipulations, with no external I/O, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The use of deepcopy and recursive methods are typical for such data management classes. The logic is straightforward, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for managing nested field groups. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing malware and obfuscated scores are correct; the risk score should be low (~0.2) reflecting minimal security concern.",
