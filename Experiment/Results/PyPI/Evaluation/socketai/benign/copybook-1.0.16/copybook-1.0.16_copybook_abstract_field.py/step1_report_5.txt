  "purpose": "Definition of an abstract class representing a data field or group of fields, including initialization, string representation, renaming, and length calculation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code is purely class definition without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The class AbstractField serves as a simple data structure with methods for initialization, renaming, and length retrieval. It contains no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network operations. The _rename_with_suffix method only modifies an internal string attribute. Overall, it appears to be a straightforward data model with no malicious or suspicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class definition with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a structural component, and there are no signs of malware or security concerns.",
