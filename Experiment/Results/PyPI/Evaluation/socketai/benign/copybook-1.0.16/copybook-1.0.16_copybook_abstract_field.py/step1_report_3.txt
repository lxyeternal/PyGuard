{
  "purpose": "Define a base class for representing a field or field group with attributes and methods for naming and length calculation.",
  "sources": "Initialization of class attributes and method definitions; no external data reads or inputs observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-critical operations detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; class attributes are set directly and methods are simple.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The method _rename_with_suffix() is for normalizing field names, which is standard. get_total_length() returns 0, suggesting placeholder implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward class with simple attributes and methods for managing field metadata. There is no evidence of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks. The class appears to be part of a larger parsing or data processing system. No untrusted data sources, no sensitive operations, and no obfuscated or malicious code detected. The methods are standard, and the code structure is clear.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, non-malicious class definition intended for data parsing or modeling. No security concerns or malicious behavior are identified.",
