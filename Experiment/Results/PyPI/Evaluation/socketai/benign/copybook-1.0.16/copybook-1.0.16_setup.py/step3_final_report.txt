  "purpose": "Review open-source Python package 'copybook' setup script for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md, package metadata, dependencies, and setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is standard setup script with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py for packaging, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. All reports provided are empty, indicating no detailed findings or concerns. Dependencies are benign, and the structure is straightforward. Given the lack of evidence, the code appears safe, and scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be zero.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is clean and standard, with no malicious or security issues detected. The empty reports do not suggest any concerns. The overall security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is negligible.",
