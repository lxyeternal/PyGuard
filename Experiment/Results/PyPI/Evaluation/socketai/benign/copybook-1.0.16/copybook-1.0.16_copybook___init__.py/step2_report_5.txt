  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1**:\n- **Issues present?** No. The code only contains import statements; no runtime behavior, data processing, or suspicious activity.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No logical errors or flaws detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1 seem reasonable given the benign nature. The security risk is low, as no data flow or execution occurs.\n- **Justification for scores:** The low risk score aligns with the benign import statements; no malicious intent or vulnerabilities are indicated.\n- **Overall:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Report 2**:\n- **Issues present?** No. Static import statements only.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** No active code, no data handling, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3**:\n- **Issues present?** No. Pure import statements.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No execution or data flow, no security concern.\n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4**:\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, fitting.\n- **Justification:** Only import statements, no malicious activity.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5**:\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors or flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No active code, only imports.\n- **Overall:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which is correct given the code is only import statements.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, as expected for static import code.\n\n**However,** considering the nature of these snippets—pure import statements—it's important to note that such code, in isolation, poses no security risk. The only concern would be if these imports are dynamically manipulated or if the imported modules are malicious, but that cannot be inferred from this snippet alone.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is evident.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since static imports are benign unless combined with malicious runtime behavior, which is not present here.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code. The scores are reasonable and justified. No changes needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code snippets are safe, with no malware or security risks based solely on these import statements.",
