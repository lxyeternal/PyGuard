{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and classes from modules related to copybook processing and field handling, likely for parsing and displaying structured data.",
  "sources": "Imports functions parse_file, parse_string, and _pprint_tree from copybook.copybook; imports classes FieldGroup and Field from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this fragment; no data processing or output functions that handle untrusted input are shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident as the code only contains import statements without any runtime data handling or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present; the code appears straightforward and standard for module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a module named copybook and relative imports from the current package. There are no functions, data processing, or user input handling shown. This is typical for module setup code and does not indicate malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a simple import setup with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It appears to be part of a larger codebase responsible for parsing and handling copybook data structures. No security issues or malware are evident.",
