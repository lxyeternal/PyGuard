{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions and classes from modules within a package, likely for parsing and handling data structures related to copybooks and fields.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading modules and specific functions or classes from those modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only imports modules and functions without executing or processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs in this snippet; it only imports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present. The code structure is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements, importing functions and classes from internal modules and from a relative module. There are no data processing, input handling, or untrusted data flows. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be part of a larger project setup or module initialization. It doesn't perform any actions or contain logic that could be malicious or insecure.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, serving as module import statements without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
