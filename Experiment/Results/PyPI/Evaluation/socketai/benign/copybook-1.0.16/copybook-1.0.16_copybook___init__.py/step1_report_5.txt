{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and classes from modules related to copybook parsing and field definitions, likely part of a larger data processing library.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'copybook.copybook' and local modules '.field_group' and '.field'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating potential data leaks or untrusted data processing; no functions or operations that execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible as the code only contains import statements without further execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; import statements are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from known modules and local files. No executable code, no input handling, and no data processing or network operations are present. The imports appear to be for a data parsing library related to copybooks and field definitions, which is common in data processing contexts. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple set of import statements from a data parsing library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet. It appears to be a standard part of a larger project with no indications of malware or security concerns.",
