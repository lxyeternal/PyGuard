{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing functions and classes from modules related to copybook processing and fields, likely for parsing or handling structured data.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing 'parse_file', 'parse_string', '_pprint_tree', 'FieldGroup', and 'Field' from other modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data output, network calls, or execution of untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are evident; the imports are standard for modular Python code.",
  "analysis": "The code is limited to import statements, which are static and do not execute any logic. No input reading, data handling, or untrusted data processing occurs here. There is no indication of obfuscated code or malicious behavior. The imports suggest intended functionality related to parsing copybooks and handling field groups, but they do not present security concerns on their own.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely contains import statements with no active logic or data handling. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
