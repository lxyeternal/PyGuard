{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions and classes related to copybook processing and field definitions, setting up dependencies for further use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'copybook.copybook' and local modules '.field_group' and '.field'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static imports.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import statements with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, which are standard for module setup. There are no runtime behaviors, data flows, or user inputs. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. Given the benign nature of import statements, the likelihood of malicious intent is negligible. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0 or very low, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with only import statements. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
