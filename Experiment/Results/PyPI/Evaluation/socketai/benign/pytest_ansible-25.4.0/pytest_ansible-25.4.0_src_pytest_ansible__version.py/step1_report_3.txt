{
  "purpose": "Defines version information for the package using setuptools-scm conventions.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; purely static assignment.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version strings and tuples to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscation, or hidden mechanisms observed. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes version variables with static, hardcoded values representing the package version. It includes a conditional type checking block that does not execute at runtime. The structure follows standard patterns for version declaration. No external input, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration module generated by setuptools-scm. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and standard for package versioning.",
