  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward, static version declaration module generated by setuptools-scm. There are no dynamic behaviors, external inputs, or suspicious constructs. The code is static, with no untrusted data sinks, no data flows from untrusted sources, and no obfuscation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly note that the code is boilerplate, safe, and contains no malicious behavior. No errors or logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; there's no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**  \nSince the code is static, auto-generated, and contains no external inputs or dynamic execution, there is no basis for assigning a higher risk score. The risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nThe reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**  \nScores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the code's purpose and structure, it is a standard version declaration file with no security concerns. The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, static, and generated for version management. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
