{
  "purpose": "Define version information for the package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string and version tuple assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "None; static assignment of version info without external input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Use of TYPE_CHECKING is standard for type hints; version info is hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward generated module defining version variables for a Python package. It uses standard practices such as conditional type hint imports and static assignment of version data. No external input, network communication, or suspicious code structures are present. The code does not contain any obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated module that provides version information. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are detected.",
