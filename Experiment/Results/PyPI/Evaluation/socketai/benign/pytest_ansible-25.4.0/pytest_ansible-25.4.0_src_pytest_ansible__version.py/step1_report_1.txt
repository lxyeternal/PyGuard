  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward version definition with no dynamic code or external inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version information for a package, using hardcoded strings and tuples. It includes type checking blocks but does not perform any input/output operations, network access, or dynamic execution. The code is standard for version management and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, static version information definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and intended for version control purposes.",
