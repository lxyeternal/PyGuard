  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code is a standard, auto-generated version module created by setuptools-scm.\n   - It defines version variables (`__version__`, `version`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`) with hardcoded values.\n   - It includes a conditional block for type hints, which is a common pattern.\n   - There are no dynamic inputs, external calls, or executable code beyond variable assignments.\n   - The code does not perform any I/O, network operations, or contain any code that could be malicious.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security & Malicious Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is static, straightforward, and generated for version management.\n   - No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.\n   - No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are observed.\n   - The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` is standard and harmless.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is justified since the code is static and benign.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as safe.\n   - No report suggests any assumption-based vulnerabilities or potential exploits.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation & My Estimate**:\n   - Given the code's simplicity and the reports' consensus, I agree with the assigned scores.\n   - The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n- The code is safe, and the report conclusions are accurate.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's nature as a boilerplate version definition file.",
