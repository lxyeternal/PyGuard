  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a generated module defining version info for a Python package.\n- It uses static, hardcoded strings and tuples.\n- It includes a conditional block for type hints (`TYPE_CHECKING`), which is standard.\n- There are no external inputs, network calls, dynamic code, or obfuscation.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs are present.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Define version info.\n- Findings: No untrusted data, no data flow, no anomalies.\n- Conclusion: Safe, straightforward, no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Define version info.\n- Findings: Static assignment, no data flow, no anomalies.\n- Conclusion: Benign, auto-generated, no malicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Define version info.\n- Findings: Static, straightforward, no external input or suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard version declaration.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Define version info.\n- Findings: No untrusted sources, no anomalies, boilerplate code.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Define version info.\n- Findings: Static assignment, standard practices, no suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, non-malicious.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis:\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple, static version declaration module.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` and static assignments are standard and benign.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.\n\n### Final scoring considerations:\n- **Malware score:** 0, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0, the code is benign, static, and generated for version management.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a typical auto-generated version info module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is safe, non-malicious, and standard for version management in Python packages. No changes needed to the scores or analysis.",
