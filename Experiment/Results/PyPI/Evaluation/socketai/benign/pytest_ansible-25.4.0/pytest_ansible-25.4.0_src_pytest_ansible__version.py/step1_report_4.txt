  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and version tuples.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; only internal variable assignments.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted input to sensitive output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines version metadata with hardcoded version strings and tuples. It includes a conditional type-checking block that imports typing modules only for type hints, which is standard practice. The assignments are straightforward and involve no external inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident, and the code appears to be boilerplate generated by setuptools-scm for version management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version definition module with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply sets version metadata for the package and includes no harmful or malicious behaviors.",
