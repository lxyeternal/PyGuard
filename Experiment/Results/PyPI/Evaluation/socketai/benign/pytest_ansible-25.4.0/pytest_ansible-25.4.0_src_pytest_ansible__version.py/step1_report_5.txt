  "purpose": "Define version information for the package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, and conditional import statements.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or security-sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version data to variables, conditional type checking (which is benign).",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward version declaration with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up version information for the package, including a string and tuple version. It includes conditional type checking imports which are standard and harmless. The version string is hardcoded as '25.4.0' and assigned to multiple variables. There are no data inputs, external calls, or code execution points. The structure is typical for a package's version file, generated automatically, and contains no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious version definition file with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
