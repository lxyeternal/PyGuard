  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, static version declaration module generated by setuptools-scm.\n- The code involves no dynamic execution, external input, network access, or obfuscation.\n- All reports assign a hardcoded version string and tuple, with conditional type hint imports, which is standard practice.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is identified in any report.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code matches the description; it is a static, auto-generated version file.\n   - No issues or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence score is 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct.\n   - Given the static, harmless nature, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - No issues detected that would warrant a higher malware score.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - They recognize the code as boilerplate, generated for version management.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are evident.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version info module.\n- No security risks, malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, standard boilerplate for version management, and poses no security threat. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
