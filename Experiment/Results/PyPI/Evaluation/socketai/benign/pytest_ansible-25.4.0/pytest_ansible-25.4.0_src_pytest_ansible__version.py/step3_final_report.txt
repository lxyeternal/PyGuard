{
  "purpose": "Define static version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string '__version__' and version tuple '__version_tuple__' assigned directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignments pose no security risk.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static data remains unchanged.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, generated, with conditional type hints, no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, auto-generated version module with hardcoded version info, conditional type hint imports, and no dynamic or external input. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0, consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. Confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration module with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
