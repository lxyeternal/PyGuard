  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for pytest-ansible to handle specific error conditions.",
  "sources": "Importing ansible.errors and subclassing its exception classes.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; classes are simply custom error subclasses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard ansible error classes and defines subclasses for specific error types. The constructor of AnsibleConnectionFailure assigns additional attributes but does not perform any operations that could be malicious. No external network activity, data handling, or dynamic code execution is present. The code serves as structured exception handling for the package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining custom exception classes without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
