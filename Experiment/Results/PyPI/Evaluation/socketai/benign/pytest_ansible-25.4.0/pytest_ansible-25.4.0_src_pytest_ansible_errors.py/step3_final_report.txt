{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for pytest-ansible error handling, serving as structural error types without executing any logic.",
  "sources": "Class inheritance from ansible.errors.AnsibleError; the __init__ method in AnsibleConnectionFailure that assigns attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or external interactions are present; no data leaks or malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and attribute assignment; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three exception classes inheriting from ansible.errors.AnsibleError. The AnsibleConnectionFailure class has an __init__ method that assigns optional attributes. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is purely structural, intended for error categorization, and does not process untrusted data or perform network operations. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, which are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security concerns. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
