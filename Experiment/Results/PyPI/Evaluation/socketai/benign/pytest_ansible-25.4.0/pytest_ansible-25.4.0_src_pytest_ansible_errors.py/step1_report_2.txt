  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for pytest-ansible to handle specific Ansible errors.",
  "sources": "Import of ansible.errors module; class initializations and inheritance.",
  "sinks": "Super constructor calls and potential use of exception messages.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and propagation of error messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code behavior, no obfuscated code, no network or file system access.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports error classes from the ansible.errors module and defines subclasses to categorize different error conditions. The __init__ method in AnsibleConnectionFailure passes a message and optionally additional context. No user input, no data from untrusted sources, no network operations, or code execution mechanisms are present. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple, well-structured set of exception class definitions for error handling within pytest-ansible. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious behavior, and poses no security risks.",
