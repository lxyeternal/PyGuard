{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for pytest-ansible that extend ansible.errors, used to handle specific error scenarios related to ansible modules and connection failures.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, constructor parameters, and imported modules. No external input handling is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as there are only class definitions and initializations without data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and only defines exception classes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports ansible.errors and defines three custom exception classes inheriting from ansible.errors.AnsibleError. Each class includes docstrings explaining their purpose. The AnsibleConnectionFailure class has an __init__ method that initializes additional attributes 'contacted' and 'dark'. There are no external inputs, code injections, or network operations. No obfuscation, malicious, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard and intended for exception handling within the pytest-ansible framework. No malicious or security-related issues are detected.",
