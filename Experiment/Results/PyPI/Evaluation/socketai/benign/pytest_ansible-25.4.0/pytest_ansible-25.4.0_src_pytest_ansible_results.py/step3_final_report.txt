  "purpose": "Data container classes for managing module and contact results, primarily used for organizing task execution outcomes.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries during class instantiation, accessing 'contacted' data via __getitem__, __getattr__, and properties.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; data is confined within class instances and internal dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries into class attributes, with no external or system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'Fixme' comments indicating incomplete implementation; no malicious code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward data management classes with no network, file, or system interaction. No code execution, dynamic evaluation, or external data leaks are present. The 'Fixme' comments suggest incomplete features but do not introduce security vulnerabilities. The data access methods are safe, and no obfuscation or malicious payloads are evident. The overall structure is benign, serving as a utility for result organization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, incomplete data container with no malicious behavior or security risks. The low risk score (0.1) appropriately reflects the placeholders and incomplete implementation, but there is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
