  "purpose": "Package metadata declaration including version, author, and email information.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static code defining metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code is static and metadata-only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with a future import and metadata variables.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a future import statement and three metadata variables (__version__, __author__, __author_email__). It does not perform any input handling, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors. The email appears legitimate, and the code's purpose is solely to provide package information. Given its static and benign nature, there are no security risks or malicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as package metadata. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
