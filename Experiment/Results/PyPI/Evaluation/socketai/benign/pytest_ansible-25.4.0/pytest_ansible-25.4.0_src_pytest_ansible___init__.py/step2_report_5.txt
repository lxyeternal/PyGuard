  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal Python module that defines package metadata (__version__, __author__, __author_email__) and imports a future feature.\n- All reports agree that there are no input sources, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code appears to be a standard package header, with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code contains only metadata definitions and a future import, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Are there any mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely static metadata with no external interactions, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- No claims are made that are based on assumptions; all analyses are grounded in the actual code content.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a simple, static module with package metadata and a future import, with no dynamic or external behavior. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately scored. No modifications are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that correctly.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If future code snippets introduce dynamic behavior, external inputs, or network activity, re-evaluation would be necessary.",
