  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code only contains:\n     - A future import: `from __future__ import annotations`\n     - Metadata variables: `__version__`, `__author__`, `__author_email__`\n   - No input/output, data processing, network calls, dynamic code execution, or external interactions.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - The email address appears to be a standard contact, not suspicious.\n   - The code is a typical package metadata declaration.\n   - No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n   - No obfuscation or dynamic code.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is straightforward and human-readable.\n   - **Risk score:** 0 — The code is benign; it does not pose any security risk.\n\n4. **Review of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature of this code.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is metadata-only, with no external or untrusted data flows.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable score assignments are observed.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume that the code is only for metadata declaration, which is accurate.\n   - No assumptions about hidden malicious code are justified here, given the simplicity.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code snippet is a standard, benign package metadata declaration with no security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus in the reports.",
