  "purpose": "Determine the version of the 'ansible' package installed to enable conditional logic based on the version.",
  "sources": "Reading 'ansible.__version__' to obtain the installed package version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or execution based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reading 'ansible.__version__' and comparing it against static version strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs straightforward version comparisons. The comment 'Fixme.' is a placeholder but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'ansible' and compares its version against specific version thresholds, setting boolean flags accordingly. This pattern is typical for version-dependent feature toggling. No user input, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The comment 'Fixme.' suggests incomplete or temporary code but does not imply malicious intent. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious or obfuscated elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard version checks on a third-party library without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
