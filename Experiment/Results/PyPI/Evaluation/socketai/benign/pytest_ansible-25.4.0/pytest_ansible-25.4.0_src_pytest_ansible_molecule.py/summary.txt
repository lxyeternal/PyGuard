  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate pytest plugin for managing molecule tests, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The main security concern relates to external input manipulation, which is standard in such tools. Malware and obfuscation scores are 0; security risk is approximately 0.2-0.3, justified by reliance on external inputs but no malicious activity."
