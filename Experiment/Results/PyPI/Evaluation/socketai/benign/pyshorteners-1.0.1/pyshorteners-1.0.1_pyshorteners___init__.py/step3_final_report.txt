  "purpose": "Factory class for dynamically loading URL shortener modules from the 'pyshorteners.shorteners' package, allowing instantiation based on attribute access.",
  "sources": "Module list obtained via 'pkgutil.iter_modules' from the 'pyshorteners.shorteners' package; attribute access triggers dynamic import.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import and instantiation via attribute names; potential if external input influences attribute access, but mitigated by validation against available modules.",
  "flows": "Attribute access (__getattr__) -> validation against available_shorteners -> importlib.import_module() -> class instantiation with kwargs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; reliance on package module list for validation reduces risk; potential risk if attribute names are manipulated externally.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a controlled plugin pattern, dynamically importing modules based on attribute names validated against a list derived from the package. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The main concern is if external inputs influence attribute names, but the validation against 'available_shorteners' mitigates this. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation. The dynamic import pattern is standard and safe within this context. The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, reflecting minimal risk due to dynamic import mechanics, assuming the environment restricts external manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured plugin factory pattern for URL shorteners, with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. The dynamic import is controlled and validated, making the security risk minimal. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the context.",
