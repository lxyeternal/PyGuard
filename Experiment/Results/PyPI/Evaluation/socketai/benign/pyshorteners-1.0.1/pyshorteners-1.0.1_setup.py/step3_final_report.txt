{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the 'pyshorteners' Python package, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; imports package metadata (__version__, __license__, __author__, __email__) from 'pyshorteners' module.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Static import of package attributes and reading static files; no dynamic or external data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with standard practices. Minor note: reliance on package attributes assumes package integrity but is common.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py for a Python package, importing metadata from the package itself, reading README.md, and configuring dependencies and classifiers. No network activity, code execution, or obfuscation is present. The use of package attributes is standard and presumes the package is trustworthy. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and align with the analysis. No further action is necessary.",
