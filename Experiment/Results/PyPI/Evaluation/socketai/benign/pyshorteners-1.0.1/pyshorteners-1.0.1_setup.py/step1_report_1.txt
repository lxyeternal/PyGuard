  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pyshorteners' Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports version, license, author info from pyshorteners module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and module attributes; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious behavior detected. Usage of standard setup tools and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures using setuptools. It imports project metadata from the pyshorteners module, reads a README file, and defines dependencies and classifiers. There are no indications of malicious code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors such as network activity, backdoors, or credential theft. The structure and logic are consistent with typical setup scripts, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and aligns with common practices.",
