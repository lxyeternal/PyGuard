  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pyshorteners' Python package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; accesses module attributes for version, license, author, and email.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "Uses package attributes and file content to populate setup configuration; no external data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; straightforward setup script. No hardcoded credentials or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and the target package, reads the README file, defines dependencies, and configures package metadata using package attributes. No code execution, dynamic evaluation, or external data manipulation occurs. It adheres to standard Python packaging practices. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats.",
