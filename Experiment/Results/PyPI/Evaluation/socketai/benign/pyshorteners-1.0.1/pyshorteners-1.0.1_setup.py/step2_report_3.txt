  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The script is a standard `setup.py` for the `pyshorteners` package.\n- It imports package metadata (`__version__`, `__license__`, `__author__`, `__email__`) from the `pyshorteners` module.\n- Reads `README.md` for long description.\n- Uses `setuptools` to configure package setup, dependencies, classifiers, etc.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing beyond static configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Findings:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity?** No. The code performs typical setup tasks.\n- **Are the package attributes (version, license, author, email) potentially malicious?** No. These are standard metadata attributes. However, importing these attributes presumes the `pyshorteners` package is safe and correctly structured.\n- **Any obfuscated or suspicious code?** No. The code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and reads static files.\n- **Any data leaks or network activity?** No.\n- **Any hardcoded secrets or credentials?** No.\n- **Any anomalies?** No.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1-5:**  \n- All reports agree: the script is a standard setup configuration, with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware.  \n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating the reviewers are certain about the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores assigned appropriate?**  \n  - Malware score: 0 in all reports, consistent with no malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n  - Security risk: 0, as no security concerns are evident.\n  - Risk score: 0 or very close to it, as the script is standard.\n\n- **Potential issues?**  \n  - The only minor point is the reliance on `pyshorteners` attributes. If the package is malicious or compromised, this could be problematic. But based on the reports, the package appears legitimate.\n  - No evidence suggests supply chain risk or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the provided code and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent.  \n- The reliance on package attributes is standard but assumes the package is safe.  \n- No signs of supply chain compromise.\n\n**Therefore, I agree with the reports' assessments.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                     |\n| Security Risk    | 0                     |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe setup script is benign, standard, and poses no security threat. No further action needed.",
