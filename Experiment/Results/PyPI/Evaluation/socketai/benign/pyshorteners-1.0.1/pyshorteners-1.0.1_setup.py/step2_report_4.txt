  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the setup script is a standard Python package configuration script.\n- They confirm that it reads static files (README.md), imports package metadata from the 'pyshorteners' module, and uses setuptools for packaging.\n- No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or code execution beyond static configuration is identified.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, indicating no evident malicious intent.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), with one slightly lower (0.9) due to reliance on package attributes.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n- The code imports attributes like `__version__`, `__license__`, `__author__`, and `__email__` from the 'pyshorteners' module. This is a common practice for dynamic versioning and metadata. It presumes that 'pyshorteners' is a benign, well-maintained package exporting these attributes, which is typical for Python packages.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The script does not perform any network activity, file writes, or environment modifications.\n- The only potential concern is the reliance on 'pyshorteners' attributes, but this is standard and does not indicate malicious intent unless the 'pyshorteners' package itself is compromised, which is outside the scope of this script review.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very close to it, justified by the benign nature of the script.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a typical, safe setup script for a Python package.\n- No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n- The reliance on 'pyshorteners' attributes is standard practice, assuming the package is trustworthy.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's characteristics.",
