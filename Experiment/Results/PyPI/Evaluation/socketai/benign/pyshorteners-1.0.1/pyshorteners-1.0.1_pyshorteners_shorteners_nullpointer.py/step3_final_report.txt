  "purpose": "A straightforward URL shortener class that interacts with an external API to shorten URLs.",
  "sources": "Input URL provided to the 'short' method; 'domain' attribute for API endpoint.",
  "sinks": "Response from the '_post' method; response content and text used as output or for exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input URL -> 'clean_url' -> API URL -> '_post' -> check 'response.ok' -> return 'response.text' or raise exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious external calls; relies on external methods assumed secure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard URL shortener implementation that sanitizes input URLs, constructs a payload, and posts to a configurable domain. Response handling is straightforward, with error raising on failure. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External dependencies ('clean_url', '_post') are assumed to be secure. The external API domain's safety depends on configuration but is not inherently malicious. No signs of data leakage, code injection, or covert network activity are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), mainly due to reliance on external API, which is typical for such services.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard URL shortener with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and the malware score correctly reflects the absence of malicious activity. No adjustments are necessary.",
