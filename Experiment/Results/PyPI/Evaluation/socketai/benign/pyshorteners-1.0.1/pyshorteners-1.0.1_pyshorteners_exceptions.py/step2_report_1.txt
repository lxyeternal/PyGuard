  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the scoring, and the reasoning.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code in question only defines custom exception classes for URL shortening/expanding and API error handling.\n- There are no data flows, external inputs, network operations, or code execution.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious constructs.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code is purely class definitions with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - No anomalies, no obfuscation, no malware, no security risks.\n   - Confirmed consistent across all reports.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are accurate in their assessment; they correctly identify that the code is benign.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws detected.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No need to adjust scores.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5.\n   - Given the benign nature, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code contains no malicious behavior.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward code analysis.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The overall assessment is that the code is safe.\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments needed.",
