  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes for URL shortening/expanding and API error handling.\n- The code snippets are straightforward class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception, with constructors formatting error messages.\n- No external data handling, network calls, or data processing are present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk score is consistently 0, indicating no apparent security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issue presence:** The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. It is purely defining exception classes.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the code or reports.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Security risk: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Risk score: 0 (appropriate, given no vulnerabilities or malicious intent)\n\n### Critical analysis:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and free of security issues.\n- The high confidence scores (1.0) are justified.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- Since the code is only exception class definitions, the likelihood of malware or obfuscation is negligible.\n- The purpose of these classes is error handling, which is a common pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Justification:** The code is standard, benign, and free of malicious or suspicious elements. The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is a straightforward, secure, and benign set of exception class definitions. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
