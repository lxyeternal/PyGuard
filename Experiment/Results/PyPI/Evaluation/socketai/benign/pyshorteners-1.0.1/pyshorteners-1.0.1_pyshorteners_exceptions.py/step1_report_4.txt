{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for URL shortening and expanding operations, including handling API and URL validation errors.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines exception classes and does not read external data or input.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; classes are purely for exception handling without data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of four custom exception classes, each inheriting from Exception, with constructors that format error messages. There are no external inputs, network calls, or data processing. The code appears to be straightforward exception definitions, serving as error indicators for URL shortening/expanding and API responses.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple set of exception class definitions with no malicious intent, data leaks, or security issues. It is unlikely to be malicious or pose a security risk.",
