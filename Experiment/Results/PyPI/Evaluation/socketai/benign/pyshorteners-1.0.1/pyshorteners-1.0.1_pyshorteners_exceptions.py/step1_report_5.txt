{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for URL shortening and expanding operations, including API response errors and invalid URLs.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; exception messages are generated internally and not used as untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; exception messages are constructed with optional parameters but do not process external untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code follows standard pattern for custom exceptions without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four custom exception classes, each inheriting from Exception. Constructors format messages using provided parameters but do not include any external input processing or network activity. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code structure is straightforward and typical for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely consists of standard custom exception class definitions with no suspicious or malicious elements. It does not pose security risks or contain malware. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
