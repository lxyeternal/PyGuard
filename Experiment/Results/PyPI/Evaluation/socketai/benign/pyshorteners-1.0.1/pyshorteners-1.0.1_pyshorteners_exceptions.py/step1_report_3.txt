  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to URL shortening and expansion processes.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; only exception class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms.",
  "flows": "No data flows; these are static exception class definitions without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs observed. Exception classes are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception. Each class has an __init__ method that formats a message string. There is no code execution, data input/output, or external communication. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears purely for error handling purposes in a URL shortening/expanding context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, containing only standard exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
