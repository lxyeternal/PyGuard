{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for URL shortening/expanding errors and API response errors.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading or data handling present).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data handling or sensitive data output).",
  "flows": "No data flows; exception classes only define error handling structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception, with messages formatted during initialization. There are no data inputs, outputs, network operations, or code execution features. The code appears to be a straightforward, standard implementation for error handling, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only custom exception definitions for URL-related errors. It poses no security risk or malware suspicion. It is a benign, standard code fragment intended for structured error reporting.",
