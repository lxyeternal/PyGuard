  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:\n   - The code only defines custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception.\n   - No external data, network operations, or data processing occurs.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n   - The classes are straightforward, with constructors formatting messages.\n\n2. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes**:\n   - No errors or flaws are evident. The exception classes are standard and correctly implemented.\n   - The message formatting in constructors is appropriate for error reporting.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification**:\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - Confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty that these are benign exception class definitions.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly assume no malicious behavior based on the provided code.\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions, there are no hidden malicious behaviors or backdoors.\n\n5. **Consistency and Recommendations**:\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - No changes are necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a standard, benign set of custom exception classes for URL operations.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n- The confidence of 1 is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
