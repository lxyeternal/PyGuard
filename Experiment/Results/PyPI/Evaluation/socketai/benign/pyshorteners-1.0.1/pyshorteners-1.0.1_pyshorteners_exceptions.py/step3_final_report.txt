{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for URL shortening/expanding and API error handling.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and constructors with formatted messages.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow, input, or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception, with constructors formatting messages. There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, or data processing. The code is clear, standard, and free of obfuscation or malicious elements. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The malware score is appropriately 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for URL operations, posing no security threat or malicious intent. All scores are consistent with this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
