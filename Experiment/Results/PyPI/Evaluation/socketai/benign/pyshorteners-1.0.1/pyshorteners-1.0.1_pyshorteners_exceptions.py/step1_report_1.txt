  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for URL shortening and expanding operations, and API response validation.",
  "sources": "None (no data input or external data reading within this code snippet).",
  "sinks": "None (no data being sent, stored, or leaked).",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward class definitions for exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class, designed for specific error cases related to URL shortening services and API responses. There are no external data sources, no input/output handling, and no embedded malicious code or obfuscation. The structure is standard, and the code does not perform any network operations, data manipulation, or security-sensitive actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely defining custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application handling URL operations, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
