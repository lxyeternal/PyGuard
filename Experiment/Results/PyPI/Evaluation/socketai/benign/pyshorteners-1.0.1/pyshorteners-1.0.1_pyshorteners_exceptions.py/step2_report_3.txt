  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code defines four custom exception classes, each inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - Each class has an `__init__` method that formats a message, optionally including a provided message.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, or data processing within this snippet.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n\n2. **Logical and Structural Evaluation**:\n   - The classes are straightforward, standard custom exceptions.\n   - The purpose is clear: to provide specific error types for URL shortening/expanding and API response issues.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or security concerns are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code contains no malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is reasonable. The code is purely for error handling with no security implications.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Overestimations**:\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment: the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n   - No reason to adjust the scores upward.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - The code snippet could be part of a larger application; in isolation, it poses no security threat.\n   - The messages are generic and do not leak sensitive information.\n   - The design is typical for exception handling in Python applications.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the overall analysis and the evidence provided.",
