  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code snippet only defines custom exception classes with straightforward constructors. There are no signs of data processing, network activity, or external interactions.\n   - All reports correctly identify that these are standard exception class definitions, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of data flow, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident. The reports correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` = 0, `obfuscated` = 0, and `securityRisk` = 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which seems reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code contains only exception class definitions with no external data handling, network activity, or embedded malicious code, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The reports correctly assign a risk score of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - No issues here.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on the code's actual content.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n**Summary of My Own Estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final Justification:**\nThe code is purely defining custom exception classes for URL operations, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative in their assessments.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is benign, with a very low security risk. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
