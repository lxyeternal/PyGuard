{
  "purpose": "A Python API client for Tiny.cc URL shortening, expansion, and click tracking, handling credentials externally and interacting with the Tiny.cc REST API.",
  "sources": "Input URLs provided to methods 'short', 'expand', and 'total_clicks'; API credentials supplied during object instantiation.",
  "sinks": "API requests sent via HTTP GET with parameters including credentials and URLs; responses parsed for JSON data; exceptions raised on errors.",
  "flows": "Input URL is cleaned, parameters are assembled with credentials, API request is made, response is parsed, and results are returned or exceptions raised.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a standard API wrapper for Tiny.cc, with proper error handling and no malicious or suspicious behaviors. Credentials are expected to be supplied externally, and no obfuscation or hidden code is present. Response parsing includes error checks, and exceptions are raised appropriately. No signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The code's logic is clear, and its network interactions are typical for such clients.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented API client with no malicious intent or suspicious features. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
