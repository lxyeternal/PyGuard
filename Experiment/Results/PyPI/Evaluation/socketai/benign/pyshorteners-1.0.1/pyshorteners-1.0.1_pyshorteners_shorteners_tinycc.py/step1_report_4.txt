  "purpose": "Implementation of Tiny.cc URL shortening, expansion, and click count retrieval functionalities within a Python package.",
  "sources": "Input URLs to the methods 'short', 'expand', and 'total_clicks'; API responses from Tiny.cc service.",
  "sinks": "API response handling, returning shortened or expanded URLs, and click count integers.",
  "flows": "Input URLs are cleaned, then used in API request parameters; responses are processed and returned as output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; API key and login are expected to be set as instance variables, not shown in code; no use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; no suspicious network activity or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical API client implementation for Tiny.cc URL shortener. It properly handles API requests and responses, raising specific exceptions for API errors. The API key and login are expected to be set as instance variables, not hardcoded, indicating configuration is external. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present. The methods perform straightforward URL shortening, expansion, and click counting, with no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured API client for Tiny.cc URL shortening service. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code fragment.",
