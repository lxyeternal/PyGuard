The primary concern is the trustworthiness of external URLs, but it does not perform any malicious actions. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting moderate concern due to unvalidated external requests but no active threat."

The primary risk involves filesystem modifications driven by user input, but no malicious behavior is detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal, non-malicious filesystem impact."

The absence of data flows, malicious patterns, or obfuscation confirms that the code is safe. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0, reflecting the non-malicious, straightforward nature of the code."
