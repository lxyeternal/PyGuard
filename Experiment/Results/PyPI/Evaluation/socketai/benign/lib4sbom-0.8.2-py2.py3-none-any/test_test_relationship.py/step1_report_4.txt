{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of unit tests for the SBOMRelationship class, testing its initialization and relationship setting/getting methods.",
  "sources": "No external input or untrusted data sources are read; the code uses only local method calls and constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows only within the class methods, involving setting and retrieving relationship attributes; no external data flow or network interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code appears to be standard unit test code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pytest framework and a class from an internal module, then defines a test class with multiple methods that instantiate the SBOMRelationship object, manipulate it, and verify its state through assertions. All interactions are confined to local object state management without any external inputs or outputs. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test suite for a class managing relationships within an SBOM context. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and poses no security risks.",
