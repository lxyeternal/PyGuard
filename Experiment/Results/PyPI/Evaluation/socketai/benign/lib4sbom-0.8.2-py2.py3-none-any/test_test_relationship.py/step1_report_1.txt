  "purpose": "Unit tests for the SBOMRelationship class, verifying initialization and relationship setting/getting methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads static method calls and class instantiations; no external data sources or user input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs are present; only internal method calls and assertions.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves creating an instance, setting relationships, and asserting values; no untrusted data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code appears to be straightforward unit testing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class and defines test cases using pytest to verify behavior of the SBOMRelationship class. It performs typical object instantiation, method calls, and assertions without handling external inputs or executing untrusted code. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard unit testing for a class related to SBOM relationships. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is safe and normal in the context of testing.",
