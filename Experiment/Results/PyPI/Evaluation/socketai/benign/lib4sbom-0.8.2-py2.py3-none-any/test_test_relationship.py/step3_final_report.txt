  "purpose": "Unit tests for the SBOMRelationship class, verifying initialization, setting, and retrieving relationships.",
  "sources": "Object instantiation and method calls within the test methods",
  "sinks": "No external data, network calls, or data outputs; all operations are in-memory",
  "flows": "Creating an object -> setting relationship -> retrieving relationship data",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for unit testing",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple set of pytest unit tests for a data structure class, involving object creation, method invocation, and assertions. There are no external data sources, user inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. All signals indicate benign, standard testing code with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test suite for a data class, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
