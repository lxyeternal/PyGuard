  "purpose": "Unit tests for the SBOMRelationship class in the lib4sbom library.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data is hardcoded within test functions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; testing methods only manipulate in-memory objects.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow; tests create objects and call methods without external input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; straightforward testing code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard unit tests using pytest to validate the behavior of the SBOMRelationship class. It initializes objects, sets relationships, and asserts expected outputs. There are no external data inputs, no network calls, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The tests focus on object method functionality with hardcoded test data. The code structure and content are typical for testing modules and contain no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for a data model class, with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security issues detected. It operates entirely in memory, with no external or hidden actions.",
