  "purpose": "Unit tests for the SBOMRelationship class to verify its methods behave correctly.",
  "sources": "Import statements, instantiation of SBOMRelationship object, method calls within test cases.",
  "sinks": "Assertions that compare expected data structures and values.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of SBOMRelationship -> method calls -> assertions verifying method outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, and no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward test code using pytest to verify the behavior of the SBOMRelationship class from an external library. There are no input sources like user input, environment variables, or network data. The class methods invoked are simple setters and getters, with no evident data manipulation or data leakage. The assertions compare known values, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No obfuscated code or malicious logic is present. The tests serve solely to validate the class functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard unit testing for a data structure class without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Overall security risk is minimal.",
