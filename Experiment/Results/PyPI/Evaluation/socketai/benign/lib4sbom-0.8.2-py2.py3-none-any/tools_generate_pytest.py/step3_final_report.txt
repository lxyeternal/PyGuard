{
  "purpose": "This script reads a Python source file, identifies class and method definitions, and generates pytest skeletons accordingly, facilitating test creation.",
  "sources": "Reads the specified Python source file line-by-line to identify class and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the script does not process untrusted data beyond reading the input file.",
  "flows": "Input file reading -> Parsing class/method definitions -> Generating pytest skeleton code.",
  "anomalies": "Contains a placeholder '<module>' in the import statement, likely a developmental artifact; no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static file reading and string-based pattern matching to generate test skeletons. It does not execute code, perform network activity, or handle sensitive data. The placeholder '<module>' is non-malicious and indicates incomplete code or a template. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected. The script's operations are straightforward and safe, with no evident security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for generating pytest skeletons from Python source files. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The placeholder '<module>' is a developmental artifact, not malicious. The overall security risk is negligible, and the code is safe for use.",
