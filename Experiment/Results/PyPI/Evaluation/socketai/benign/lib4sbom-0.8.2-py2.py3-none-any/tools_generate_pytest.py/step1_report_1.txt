  "purpose": "The script generates pytest skeleton test code for a given Python source file, automating the creation of test functions based on class and method definitions.",
  "sources": "Reads a filename from command line arguments, then reads the specified Python source file line by line.",
  "sinks": "None; the script only reads input files and prints generated code to stdout or a file. No untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> Read file content -> Parse for class/method definitions -> Generate test code based on parsed lines.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated parts, or suspicious constructs. No use of dynamic execution or unsafe patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command line arguments to identify a target Python source file. It opens and reads the file, scanning for class and function definitions. For each class, it generates a pytest class, and for each method (excluding __init__), it generates a test function. It handles 'set_' prefixed functions specially, assuming they set attributes and generating assertions accordingly. The code does not perform any network operations, data leakage, or execute untrusted code. It also doesn't handle any user input or environment variables that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script designed for test generation. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is straightforward code parsing and code generation without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
