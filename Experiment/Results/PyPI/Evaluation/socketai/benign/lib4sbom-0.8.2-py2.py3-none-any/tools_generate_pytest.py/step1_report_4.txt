{
  "purpose": "The code generates pytest skeletons for a given Python source file by parsing class and function definitions.",
  "sources": "Reads the filename from command-line arguments and reads the contents of the specified Python source file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is written or transmitted; no external calls or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> file reading -> code parsing -> generated output (standard output or file).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward code generator that reads a specified Python source file, extracts class and method definitions, and produces corresponding pytest skeletons. It uses standard libraries (argparse, sys, textwrap, and file I/O) with no dynamic code execution, external network calls, or data leaks. The code appears benign and solely intended for test scaffolding. No signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test scaffolding generator with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply parses a source file and outputs pytest skeletons. There are no indications of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.",
