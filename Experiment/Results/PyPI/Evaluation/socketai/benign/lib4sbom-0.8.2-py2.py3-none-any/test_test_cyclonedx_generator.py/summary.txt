  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a non-functional test scaffold with no malicious intent or security risks. The absence of data flows, malicious patterns, or obfuscation confirms that the code is safe. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0, reflecting the non-malicious, straightforward nature of the code."
