  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on supply chain threats and code anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input data reading points, environment variables, network connections, file operations, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing functions, network calls, or system interactions, indicating potential malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, unusual network domains, suspicious file operations, dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is benign, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors. Obfuscation is minimal and justified in incomplete or obscured snippets. No evidence of malicious intent or sabotage was found. The code's structure and behavior align with standard utility functions, with no anomalous data flows or suspicious sinks. Confidence levels are high where code clarity exists, and low where obfuscation or incompleteness hampers certainty. The malware score is set to 0, reflecting no malicious activity. Security risk is low (0.2), consistent with benign utility code. Obfuscation is minimal, justified in cases of incomplete code, with a score of 0.2 where applicable. Overall, the assessment indicates a safe supply chain component with negligible security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with minimal obfuscation and low security risk. No further action is necessary based on current information.",
