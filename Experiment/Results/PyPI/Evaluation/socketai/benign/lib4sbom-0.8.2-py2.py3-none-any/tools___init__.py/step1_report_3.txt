{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions within a larger project.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from environment variables and function arguments; it also accesses external modules and possibly network resources depending on imported libraries.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing to files, sending data over the network, executing system commands, or handling sensitive data such as credentials or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or function inputs to processing functions, which may then output data or perform actions such as network communication or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no immediately obvious anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow. However, if the code dynamically executes code or accesses network resources without validation, that could be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain any evident malicious patterns like system command injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. It uses standard Python functions and library calls. No hard-coded secrets or suspicious URL domains are visible. The structure appears straightforward. Without more context or actual network activity, the code seems benign. The absence of obfuscated or complex code patterns suggests it is likely legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be normal utility code without hidden malicious intent. However, full security confidence depends on the actual runtime behavior and external interactions which are not provided here.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
