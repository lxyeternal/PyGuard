  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on supply chain threats, code anomalies, obfuscation, and potential malware indicators.",
  "sources": "Dynamic imports, environment variables, network connections, environment data access, input/output points, external data handling.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, system commands, environment variable access, data exfiltration points, dynamic code execution paths.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or dynamic imports leading to network communication, system modifications, or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic import/execution, obfuscation (e.g., unusual code constructs), hardcoded secrets, suspicious external connections, unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits minimal signs of malicious activity. Reports 1, 2, 4, and 5 describe benign scripts with no suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks, aligning with low malware and risk scores. Report 3 notes dynamic import/execution and some obfuscation, which could be exploited maliciously but lacks concrete evidence. The malware score of 0.2 and obfuscation score of 0.3 are justified given these concerns. Confidence levels are appropriate, reflecting the limited code context. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the described code behaviors and potential risks.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign overall, with minor concerns related to dynamic code execution in one report. Scores are appropriately cautious, and no significant malicious activity is detected. Slight adjustments to risk and obfuscation scores could be considered, but current values are justified.",
