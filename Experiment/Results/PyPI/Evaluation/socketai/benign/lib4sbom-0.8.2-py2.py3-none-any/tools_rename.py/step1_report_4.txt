{
  "purpose": "The script renames all files in a specified directory to lowercase.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input for the directory path and lists files within that directory using os.listdir().",
  "sinks": "The code renames files using os.rename(), which can modify filesystem data based on input.",
  "flows": "User input -> os.listdir() -> os.path.join() -> os.rename()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code straightforwardly renames files without any obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script prompts the user to input a directory path, then iterates through all files in that directory, renaming each to its lowercase equivalent. It uses standard library functions without external dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system compromise. The code's functionality appears benign and solely intended for filename normalization.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, legitimate operation of renaming files to lowercase without any malicious intent. There are no signs of malware or security risks in this code fragment.",
