  "purpose": "The script renames all files in a specified directory to lowercase.",
  "sources": "Input from the user via input() function for the directory path; os.listdir() reading filenames in the specified directory.",
  "sinks": "os.rename() function that performs the renaming of files, potentially overwriting files if case-insensitive matches exist.",
  "flows": "User input (directory_path) -> os.listdir() reads filenames -> filenames are processed -> os.rename() executes for each filename to rename files to lowercase.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The script performs simple file renaming without external network activity or data leakage. No obfuscation or unusual code structures present.",
  "analysis": "The code takes a directory path from user input, lists all files in that directory, and renames each file to its lowercase equivalent if it differs from the current filename. It uses standard library functions without complex logic or external communications. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage. The only potential concern is the lack of input validation, which could lead to errors or unintended overwriting if files differ only by case in case-insensitive filesystems, but this is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward file renaming utility with no malicious intent. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or security risks beyond potential filename conflicts. The overall security risk is minimal.",
