  "purpose": "The code prompts the user for a directory path and renames all files within that directory to lowercase.",
  "sources": "The user input for directory path, os.listdir() for listing files.",
  "sinks": "os.rename() for renaming files, which modifies filesystem state based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input from user -> list files -> generate new filenames -> rename files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code; straightforward filename normalization.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a benign operation of converting filenames to lowercase. It uses standard library functions without obfuscation or malicious payloads. The main concern is the lack of input validation, which could lead to unintended filesystem modifications or filename conflicts, especially on case-insensitive filesystems. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or backdoors are present. The code's behavior is predictable and intended, with minimal security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for filename normalization with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary risk involves filesystem modifications driven by user input, but no malicious behavior is detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal, non-malicious filesystem impact.",
