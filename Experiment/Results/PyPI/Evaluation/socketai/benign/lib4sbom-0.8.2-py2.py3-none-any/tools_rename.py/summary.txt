  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility for filename normalization with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary risk involves filesystem modifications driven by user input, but no malicious behavior is detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting minimal, non-malicious filesystem impact."
