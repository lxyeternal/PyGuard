  "purpose": "The code renames all files in a specified directory to lowercase.",
  "sources": "User input for directory path via input() function, os.listdir() reading filenames from the directory, os.path.join() constructing file paths.",
  "sinks": "os.rename() to rename files, which can modify filesystem files based on input.",
  "flows": "User input -> directory path used in os.listdir() -> filenames processed -> os.rename() called to rename files to lowercase.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No malicious or unusual behavior detected. The code performs a simple file renaming operation based on user input.",
  "analysis": "The script prompts the user for a directory path, then iterates over all files in that directory, renaming each to lowercase. There are no external network connections, data leaks, or malicious commands. The functionality is straightforward, with no obfuscated code or hidden behavior. The only potential risk is that it modifies user-specified files, but this is intended behavior for a utility script, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic utility for renaming files to lowercase. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, limited to filesystem modifications based on user input. No suspicious signals or anomalies are present.",
