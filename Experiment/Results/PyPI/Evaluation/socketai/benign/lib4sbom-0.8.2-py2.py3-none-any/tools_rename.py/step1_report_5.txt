  "purpose": "The script renames all files in a specified directory to lowercase.",
  "sources": "Input from the user (directory path) via input(), os.listdir() to read directory contents.",
  "sinks": "os.rename() to rename files based on the lowercased filenames.",
  "flows": "User provides directory path -> os.listdir() reads filenames -> filenames are converted to lowercase -> os.rename() renames files.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; straightforward filename normalization. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code takes a directory path input from the user, lists all files within that directory, and renames each file to its lowercase equivalent. The logic is simple and intended for file normalization. There are no external data leaks, no code injection points, and no suspicious or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is the use of input() without validation, which could lead to unintended directory access, but this is not malicious. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data transmission are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign task of renaming files to lowercase and contains no malicious behavior. It has a low security risk but could benefit from input validation to prevent accidental or malicious directory access.",
