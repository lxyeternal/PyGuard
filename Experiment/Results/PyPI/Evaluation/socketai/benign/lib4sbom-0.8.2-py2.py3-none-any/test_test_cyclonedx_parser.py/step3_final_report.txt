  "purpose": "A test suite for the CycloneDXParser module, reading local test files and performing assertions on parsed data.",
  "sources": "Local test data files in the 'data' directory, read via os.path and open functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or data transmission occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from local files into the parser, then into assertions; no external flows or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Placeholder assertions (`assert False`) in some tests, indicating incomplete tests but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite with no malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It reads local files, invokes a parser, and performs assertions. No external data or network activity is present. The placeholder assertions are typical in incomplete tests and do not indicate malicious intent. The parser implementation is not shown, but the test code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for a parser module, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: near zero) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
