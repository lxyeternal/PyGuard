  "purpose": "Unit testing the SBOMFile class from lib4sbom.data.file to verify its functionality and data handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data is generated within the test methods.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication, such as network calls or file writes, are present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the tests are self-contained and do not involve untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests for a data class, involving setting and getting properties, copying data, and validating behavior. There are no external inputs, no network communications, no file manipulations, nor obfuscated or dynamic code execution. All operations are straightforward method calls and assertions within a controlled test environment. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage are present. The code's structure and purpose are clear and typical for unit testing.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard test suite for a data model class with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe, with no evidence of malware, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.",
