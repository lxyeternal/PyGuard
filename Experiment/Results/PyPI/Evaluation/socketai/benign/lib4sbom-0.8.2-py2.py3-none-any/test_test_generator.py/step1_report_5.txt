{
  "purpose": "This code defines a test suite for the SBOMGenerator class, intended to verify its various methods related to generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in different formats.",
  "sources": "The code imports pytest for testing framework and the SBOMGenerator class from lib4sbom.generator.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the code; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "The code structure is a test class with methods that assert False, which do not process or handle data flows.",
  "anomalies": "All test methods are placeholders with assertions that always fail; no real implementation or data processing occurs. No suspicious or unusual code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test class setup, importing a generator module and defining multiple test functions that currently only assert False, indicating incomplete or stub tests. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or security risks. The code does not handle external inputs, nor does it perform any operations beyond test method definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic, incomplete test suite with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a template or scaffold for future tests. No security risks or malware signals are detected.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
