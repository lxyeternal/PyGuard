{
  "purpose": "This code defines a test suite for the SBOMGenerator class with placeholder methods, serving as scaffolding for future tests.",
  "sources": "The code imports pytest and the SBOMGenerator class; no external data input or dynamic sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, external communication, or data leaks are present; the code contains only placeholder assertions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code consists solely of static test method definitions with assert False.",
  "anomalies": "All test methods are placeholders with 'assert False', indicating incomplete tests; no malicious or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, incomplete test scaffold with no data processing, external communication, or malicious patterns. The placeholder assertions do not introduce security risks. The code structure is straightforward, and no obfuscation or malware is detected. The reports correctly identify the code as harmless, with high confidence scores. No anomalies or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, incomplete test scaffold with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
