  "flows": "Reading license URLs from JSON -> requesting license text from URLs -> saving license HTML to files",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious obfuscated code, no unusual behavior. Uses standard libraries only.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a JSON file containing license info, iterates over each license, and fetches license text HTML content from URLs. It then saves this content to files. There are no obfuscation techniques, malicious code, or suspicious network activities. The request handling includes exception catching for network errors. There are no hardcoded secrets or indications of malicious intent. The use of requests.get() is straightforward for retrieving data. No data leakage, backdoors, or malware behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign script for processing and storing license information from remote URLs. No malicious behavior or supply chain security threats identified.",
