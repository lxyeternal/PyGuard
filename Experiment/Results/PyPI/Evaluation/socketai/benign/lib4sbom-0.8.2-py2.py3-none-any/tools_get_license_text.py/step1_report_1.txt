  "purpose": "The script processes a list of licenses from a JSON file, retrieves their detailed license texts from URLs via HTTP requests, and saves the license text HTML to local files.",
  "sources": "Reads local JSON file 'spdx_licenses.json' and license data text files; reads license detail URLs from JSON data.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs for license texts; writes license HTML content to local files.",
  "flows": "Reads license metadata from JSON → fetches license text via HTTP request → writes license text HTML to local files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution. No data leakage or privacy violations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads license data from a local JSON file, iterates through each license to fetch detailed license texts via HTTP GET requests using 'requests.get'. It then writes the license text HTML into local files. The code includes standard exception handling for request failures. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as system compromise, data exfiltration, or backdoors identified. Usage of requests to fetch publicly available data is typical, and no malicious payloads are present. The code's flow appears straightforward and intended solely for license data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs license data processing and retrieval from external URLs without malicious intent. No signs of malware or security risks detected. It is a typical data processing script with no malicious behavior.",
