  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the same simple code: raising an ImportError with a static message informing users that 'MAgent' has moved to 'magent2' and providing installation instructions.\n- The code is static, contains no user input, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, informational, and non-malicious.\n\n**Confirming issues:**\n- The code matches the description in all reports: a straightforward `raise ImportError(...)` with a static message.\n- No anomalies, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The code functions as intended: to inform users about package migration.\n- No issues with the reasoning or summary in the reports.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n- These scores are consistent with the analysis: the code is benign, static, and non-malicious.\n\n**Risk justification:**\n- Since the code is static and only raises an informational exception, the security risk is negligible.\n- The only potential concern would be if the message were dynamically generated or if it contained malicious links or code, but it does not.\n- Therefore, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted.\n\n**Malware score:**\n- The malware score is correctly 0; there's no malicious activity.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code does not perform any risky operations.\n- The report correctly identifies the purpose and benign nature.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, static message)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, static exception message serving as a user guidance notice. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious and non-obfuscated. No adjustments needed.",
