  "flows": "No data flow from external sources; the code merely raises a static exception with a fixed message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code raises an ImportError with a message informing the user that 'MAgent' has been moved to a new package 'magent2' and provides the installation command and a URL. There are no dynamic or user input components, no code execution or data leakage mechanisms. The purpose is solely to inform the user about package migration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static exception message intended to guide users on package migration. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
