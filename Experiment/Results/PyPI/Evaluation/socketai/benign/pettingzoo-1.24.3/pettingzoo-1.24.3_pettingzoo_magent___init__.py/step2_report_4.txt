  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports describe the same code: raising an ImportError with a static message informing users that the 'MAgent' package has been moved to 'magent2' and providing installation instructions and a URL.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and contains no dynamic or untrusted data handling.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and confidence of 1.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code matches the original: a static `raise ImportError` with a fixed message.\n- No issues are present in the code itself; it’s a simple user guidance notice.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are evident; the message is clear and serves its purpose.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Confidence:** All assign 1, which is justified given the straightforward analysis.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- Since the code is static and only provides a message, there's no basis for higher scores.\n- The reports correctly identify that there's no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The purpose of this code is purely informational, guiding users during package migration.\n- No external data, dynamic code, or network activity is involved.\n- The code does not pose any security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the scores provided in all reports:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese are appropriate given the code's benign, static nature.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
