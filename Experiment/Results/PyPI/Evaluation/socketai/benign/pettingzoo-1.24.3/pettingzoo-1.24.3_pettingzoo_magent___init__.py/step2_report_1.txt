  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code simply raises an `ImportError` with a static message. There are no dynamic components, no input handling, and no external data or network activity.\n   - The code is straightforward and intended solely for user guidance regarding package migration.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note that the code is benign, static, and informational.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1 across all, which is reasonable since the analysis is straightforward.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, aligning with the code's benign purpose.\n   - No justification for higher risk scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious activity.\n   - No issues here.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly interpret the code as informational and non-malicious.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a static, benign exception message informing users about package migration.\n- There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My Own Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high, given the simplicity and clarity)\n\n**Final note:** The code is a typical deprecation notice implemented via an exception, serving an informational purpose only. It poses no security threat.",
