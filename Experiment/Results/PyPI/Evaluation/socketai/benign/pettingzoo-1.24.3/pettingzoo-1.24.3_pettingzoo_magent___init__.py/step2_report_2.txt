  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe a static `raise ImportError` with a fixed message.\n   - The code does not read external data, execute dynamic code, or perform any suspicious operations.\n   - The purpose is purely informational, guiding users to install a new package after migration.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is static, benign, and serves as a user guidance notice.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which is justified.\n   - Since the code is non-malicious and purely informational, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - No malicious activity is present, so this is accurate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and code behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall Assessment:\nThe code is a straightforward, static exception message serving as a user notification about package migration. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the provided reports.",
