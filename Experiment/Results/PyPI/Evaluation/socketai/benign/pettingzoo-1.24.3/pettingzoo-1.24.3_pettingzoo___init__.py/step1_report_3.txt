{
  "purpose": "Configure environment variables for SDL and Pygame, and optionally display notifications for the PettingZoo library version.",
  "sources": "Environment variables set via os.environ; import statements; access to notifications dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables can influence SDL/pygame behavior; print statement outputs notifications to stderr.",
  "flows": "Importing pettingzoo.utils -> setting environment variables -> optional import of notifications -> printing notifications based on version.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. Use of environment variables for SDL configuration is benign. Exception handling is broad but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets environment variables to configure SDL and Pygame audio drivers. It conditionally imports a notifications module and prints version-specific messages if available. No data leaks, no network activity, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior are evident. The exception handling is generic but safe, with no suspicious actions. Overall, the code appears to be standard configuration and notification code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration script that manages environment variables for SDL and Pygame, and optionally displays notifications based on the PettingZoo version. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified.",
