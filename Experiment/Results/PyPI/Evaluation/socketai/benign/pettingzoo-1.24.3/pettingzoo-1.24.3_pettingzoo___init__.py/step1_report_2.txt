{
  "purpose": "Configure environment variables for audio and display support, and handle notifications related to the pettingzoo package.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), import statements, notifications dictionary, sys.platform check",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified",
  "flows": "Environment variable settings influence external libraries (pygame), notification import and display logic",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling without specific error handling, conditional environment variable settings, no visible malicious code or data exfiltration, no obfuscated code or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code sets environment variables to modify SDL and pygame behavior based on platform, imports notification modules, and conditionally prints messages. No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior are evident. The exception handling is broad but not malicious; it prevents crashes if notification import fails. Overall, the code is benign, primarily configuring environment settings and displaying notifications.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign configuration and notification handling script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
