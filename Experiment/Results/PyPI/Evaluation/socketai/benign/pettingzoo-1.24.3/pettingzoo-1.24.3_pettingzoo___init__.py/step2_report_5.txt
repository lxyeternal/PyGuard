  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code's behavior, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code's primary function is environment configuration: setting SDL and Pygame environment variables based on platform, suppressing support prompts, and optionally displaying notifications related to the pettingzoo library version.\n- No user input, network activity, or data exfiltration is present.\n- The code imports a notifications module (`farama_notifications`) and, if relevant notifications exist for the current version, prints a message to stderr.\n- Exception handling is broad but benign, mainly to prevent crashes if the notifications module isn't available or doesn't contain relevant data.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The environment variable modifications are standard practice for controlling SDL and Pygame behavior.\n- No signs of malicious activity, malware, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Environment setup and notifications display.\n- **Analysis:** Completely benign, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.0 — **appropriate**.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly scored. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar environment configuration and notification handling.\n- **Analysis:** Also benign, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — slightly higher risk score.\n- **Justification:** The risk score of 0.2 reflects minor concerns about broad exception handling and environment variable modifications, but these are standard and benign.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score seems reasonable. No malware detected. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Same conclusion — benign environment setup and notifications.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — very low.\n- **Justification:** The minimal risk score aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar environment configuration with notifications.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; standard configuration.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — consistent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly scored.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct scoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 or 0.2) are reasonable given the broad exception handling and environment variable modifications, which are standard in such setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — 0.2 — very low, given the benign nature but acknowledging the broad exception handling and environment modifications.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are appropriate, and the code is safe. No adjustments are necessary.",
