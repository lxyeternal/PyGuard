  "purpose": "Configure environment variables for SDL and Pygame audio drivers on Linux, suppress support prompts, and display notifications if available.",
  "sources": "Environment variable assignments, import of notifications module, conditional notification display",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Set environment variables -> import notifications -> check and print notifications",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling (except Exception), but benign in this context; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code sets environment variables to configure SDL and Pygame behavior on Linux, suppresses support prompts, and optionally displays notifications based on the pettingzoo version. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Exception handling is broad but harmless. The environment variable modifications are standard configuration steps. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment setup and notification script with no malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports accurately assess the code's safety, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or revision is necessary.",
