{
  "purpose": "Configure environment variables for audio and display settings, and optionally display notifications related to the pettingzoo package version.",
  "sources": "Environment variables set via os.environ; import statements; notifications data read from farama_notifications.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies environment variables affecting audio configuration; prints notifications to standard error.",
  "flows": "Environment variable setup (source) -> import of modules -> optional printing of notifications (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; environment variable configuration is standard; notification check is non-standard but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets environment variables to influence SDL and Pygame behavior on Linux systems, which is common for controlling audio driver selection. It suppresses Pygame support prompts. It then attempts to import a notifications module and conditionally prints notifications related to a specific package version, catching all exceptions silently. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be standard environment configuration and user notification logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing environment setup and optional notification display with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
