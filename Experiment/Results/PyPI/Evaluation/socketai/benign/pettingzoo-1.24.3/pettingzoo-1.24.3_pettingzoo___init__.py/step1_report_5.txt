  "purpose": "Configure environment variables for SDL audio driver and hide Pygame support prompt; attempt to display notifications related to 'pettingzoo' and version.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ), importing modules, reading notifications dictionary, accessing sys.platform",
  "sinks": "Modifying environment variables (os.environ), printing to stderr",
  "flows": "Environment setup (os.environ modifications) -> conditional notification check -> potential print of notification message",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, straightforward environment configuration and notification display. No suspicious or malicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets environment variables to configure SDL audio driver and hide support prompts for Pygame. It then attempts to import a notification module and conditionally prints a notification message if available. No user input, network operations, or suspicious logic present. The try-except block is broad but only catches exceptions from the notification import and access, which is not inherently malicious. No malware signatures or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs environment setup for audio and display preferences, and optionally displays notifications. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks observed.",
