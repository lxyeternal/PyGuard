  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python module that re-exports symbols from an external library. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a minor overestimation of security risk at 0.1 in one report, which can be set to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security concern."
