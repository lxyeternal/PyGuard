  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or outputs",
  "flows": "None; static import and export only",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export pattern, no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports three objects from a third-party library and defines __all__ to expose them. It contains no data manipulation, network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk scores. The code's simplicity and reliance on a trusted library indicate no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python module that re-exports symbols from an external library. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a minor overestimation of security risk at 0.1 in one report, which can be set to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security concern.",
