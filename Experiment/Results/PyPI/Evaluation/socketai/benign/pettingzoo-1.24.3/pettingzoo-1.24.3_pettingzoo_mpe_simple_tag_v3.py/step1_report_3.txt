{
  "purpose": "To re-export specific components (env, parallel_env, raw_env) from the pettingzoo.mpe.simple_tag.simple_tag module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing env, parallel_env, raw_env from an external module.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data handling or user input processing.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs a static import and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple re-export of specific functions or objects from an external module. It imports three items and exposes them via __all__. There is no data manipulation, no dynamic code execution, and no untrusted data flow. The import is from a known library (pettingzoo), which is a reinforcement learning environment library, not inherently suspicious. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module re-export, with no indications of malicious intent or security concerns.",
