{
  "purpose": "To handle deprecated environment modules by delegating to a deprecated handler function.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'deprecated_handler' from 'pettingzoo.utils.deprecated_module'.",
  "sinks": "The function '__getattr__' returns the result of 'deprecated_handler', which may process 'env_name' and module paths.",
  "flows": "User code calls '__getattr__' with 'env_name' -> '__getattr__' invokes 'deprecated_handler' with 'env_name', '__path__', and '__name__'.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on external 'deprecated_handler' function; no direct anomalies, but the use of '__getattr__' for dynamic attribute access is notable.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a handler for deprecated modules and defines a '__getattr__' function that delegates attribute access to 'deprecated_handler' with contextual module info. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not include any suspicious or malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Its purpose appears to be managing deprecated environment modules in a controlled manner. No unusual data flows or external network interactions are evident. The code does not perform any dangerous operations on its own.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple delegate for deprecated module handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign part of a larger package's deprecation management system.",
