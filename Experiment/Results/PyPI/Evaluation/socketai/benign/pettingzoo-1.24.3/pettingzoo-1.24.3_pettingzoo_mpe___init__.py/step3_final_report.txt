  "purpose": "Handle deprecated attributes dynamically via module-level __getattr__ delegation.",
  "sources": "Attribute access requests to the module, passed as env_name to deprecated_handler.",
  "sinks": "Potentially within deprecated_handler if it processes untrusted data or performs malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Attribute request -> __getattr__ -> deprecated_handler(env_name, __path__, __name__)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward delegation pattern, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a standard pattern for managing deprecated attributes by delegating to an external handler. No suspicious or malicious code is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0 and obfuscated=0. Security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), justified by reliance on an external function, but no evidence suggests malicious intent. Confidence levels are high. The pattern is common and safe; no issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for deprecated attribute handling. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is evident. The low security risk score is appropriate, considering external dependency, but the code itself is safe.",
