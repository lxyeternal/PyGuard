{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically retrieves deprecated environment handlers from the pettingzoo.utils.deprecated_module, likely for backward compatibility or deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "The code reads the env_name parameter provided when __getattr__ is invoked.",
  "sinks": "The code calls deprecated_handler, which may process env_name; no other sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input env_name flows into deprecated_handler via the __getattr__ method, which may return some handler or deprecated object.",
  "anomalies": "The use of __getattr__ to delegate attribute access is normal; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a special method __getattr__, which is invoked when an attribute is not found in the module's namespace. It calls deprecated_handler with the attribute name, the module path, and the module name. The purpose appears to be to handle deprecated attributes gracefully. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, and the imported function is used in a standard way for deprecation handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a fallback for deprecated attribute access in a module, delegating to a handler function. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a normal pattern for deprecation support.",
