{
  "purpose": "To expose the imported environment components from the pettingzoo library for use in a larger application or testing framework.",
  "sources": "Import statement from pettingzoo.mpe.simple_adversary.simple_adversary",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only performs a static import and exposes symbols",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any code execution, data handling, or dynamic features; straightforward import and export",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports three objects (env, parallel_env, raw_env) from a module within the pettingzoo library and defines an __all__ list for module exports. There are no functions, data processing, or external input handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. It is a standard module import and export pattern, with no indication of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement with explicit exports, serving to re-export components from the pettingzoo library. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
