  "purpose": "Import specific environment functions from the pettingzoo.mpe.simple_adversary.simple_adversary module for use in a larger application or script.",
  "sources": "The import statement for env, parallel_env, raw_env from the pettingzoo.mpe.simple_adversary.simple_adversary module.",
  "sinks": "None directly; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform actions with external effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and minimal, with no suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from an external package and declares them for export. It does not process data, execute untrusted code, or perform any operations that could be malicious. The import relies on the external module, which is assumed to be benign. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard import statement with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as part of a larger codebase that utilizes the pettingzoo environment components.",
