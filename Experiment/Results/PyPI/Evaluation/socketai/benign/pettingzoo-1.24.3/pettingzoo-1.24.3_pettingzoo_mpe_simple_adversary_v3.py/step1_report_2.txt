{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific environments from the pettingzoo library for multi-agent reinforcement learning, likely for simulation or training purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'pettingzoo.mpe.simple_adversary.simple_adversary' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output points; the code only exports imported objects.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from source to sink; merely imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists of a simple import and export statement with no additional logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three entities ('env', 'parallel_env', 'raw_env') from a specific submodule of the pettingzoo library, which is used for multi-agent environments. It then declares these for export via __all__. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code execution, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be a standard module re-exporting selected objects for external use.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module that re-exports specific environment objects from a well-known open-source library. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
