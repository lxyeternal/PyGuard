  "purpose": "To import specific environment classes or functions from the pettingzoo library for multi-agent reinforcement learning tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing env, parallel_env, and raw_env from pettingzoo.mpe.simple_adversary.simple_adversary.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from source to sink within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward import statement with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific objects from an open-source library (pettingzoo). It then declares __all__ for module exports. There are no signs of data handling, dynamic execution, or embedded secrets. The code is minimal, clean, and typical for a Python package module.\n\nNo signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. It is a simple import and export declaration with no side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement from an open-source library with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It merely sets up the namespace for use elsewhere.",
