  "purpose": "Import specific environments from the pettingzoo.mpe.simple_push.simple_push module for use in reinforcement learning or multi-agent simulation.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing env, parallel_env, and raw_env from an external module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink occurs in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a straightforward import statement with no embedded logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three objects from an external package. It does not process or handle untrusted data, nor does it contain any executable logic beyond the import. The '__all__' declaration specifies exported symbols. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement used to include environment objects from an open-source multi-agent reinforcement learning library. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
