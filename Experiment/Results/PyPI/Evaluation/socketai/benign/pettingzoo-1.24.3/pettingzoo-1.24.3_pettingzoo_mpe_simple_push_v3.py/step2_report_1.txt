  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Issue presence**: The code is a straightforward import/export statement.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None identified; the reasoning is sound.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. This seems appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: Benign, no security issues.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same as above; simple import.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: No issues.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Reasonable.\n   - **Conclusion**: Safe, benign.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Again, just an import statement.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: No issues.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion**: No security concern.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same as above; standard import.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Correct.\n   - **Conclusion**: Benign.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Issue presence**: Same as others; simple import/export.\n   - **Errors/flaws**: None.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Reasonable.\n\n**Overall assessment**:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign, straightforward import/export statement.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward import)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a standard module re-export pattern with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
