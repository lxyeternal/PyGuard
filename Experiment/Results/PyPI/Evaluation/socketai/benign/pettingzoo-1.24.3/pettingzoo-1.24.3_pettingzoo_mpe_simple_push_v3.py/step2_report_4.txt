  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a simple import/export statement with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign; no issues.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Assessment:** Similarly, this is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Assessment:** Again, a simple import with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Assessment:** Same as above; the code is just importing modules from an open-source library with no malicious intent.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Assessment:** Consistent with previous; no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code Content:** All reports analyze identical code snippets—simple import/export statements.\n- **Malware and Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware or obfuscation in any report.\n- **Security Risks:** No data flow, external data handling, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Score Justification:** The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable and consistent with the code's simplicity.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Remain at 0 for all reports; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Remain at 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Remain at 0; no security issues.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- If future code snippets involve dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity, reassessment would be necessary.\n- Given the current static import statements, no change in scoring is warranted.\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate. The code is benign, with scores appropriately reflecting the absence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
