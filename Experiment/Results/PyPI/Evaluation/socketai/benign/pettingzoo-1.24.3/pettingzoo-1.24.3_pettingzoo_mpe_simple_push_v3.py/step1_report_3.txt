{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific environment functions and variables from the pettingzoo library, specifically related to simple_push environment in the MPE (Multi-Agent Particle Environment) suite.",
  "sources": "Import statement from pettingzoo.mpe.simple_push.simple_push module.",
  "sinks": "None observed. The code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports predefined functions and variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and typical for a module import.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement and an __all__ declaration. It imports three objects: env, parallel_env, and raw_env. These are likely functions or variables related to the environment setup within pettingzoo. The __all__ declaration specifies these for module export. There are no signs of obfuscated code, data handling, or malicious behavior. The code is standard for Python modules defining API exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, legitimate import statement intended to expose specific environment functions for use elsewhere. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe and typical for such a module.",
