  "purpose": "Import specific environment components from the pettingzoo.mpe.simple_push package for use in reinforcement learning or simulation tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing modules from an external package 'pettingzoo.mpe.simple_push.simple_push'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths within this code snippet; primarily an import declaration and module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three objects (env, parallel_env, raw_env) from a specified module within an open-source package and then explicitly exports these objects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The snippet is minimal and straightforward, focusing on module imports and exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module import/export statement within a larger application. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
