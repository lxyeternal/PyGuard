  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external effects",
  "flows": "Import of env, parallel_env, raw_env; then exported via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import/export pattern with no suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of three objects and declares them for export. No data handling, network activity, or code execution is present. No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns are detected. The code's purpose is purely structural, facilitating access to environment components. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements justify these scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module re-export with no security concerns or malicious behavior. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
