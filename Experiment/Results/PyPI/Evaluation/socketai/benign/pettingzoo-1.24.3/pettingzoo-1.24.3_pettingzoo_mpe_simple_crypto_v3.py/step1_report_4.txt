{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific environment functions and variables from a PettingZoo environment module related to simple_crypto within the multi-agent environment library.",
  "sources": "Import statement from pettingzoo.mpe.simple_crypto.simple_crypto",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output mechanisms are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths are observable in this code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present; the code appears to be a straightforward import and export declaration",
  "analysis": "The code imports three entities (env, parallel_env, raw_env) from a specified module related to simple_crypto. It then explicitly exports these three identifiers via __all__. The structure is minimal and typical for module setup. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The module's purpose appears to be exposing specific environment functions for use elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import/export snippet with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks detected. It simply re-exports certain environment functions from the specified PettingZoo environment module.",
