{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific environment components from the pettingzoo library related to multi-agent environments, likely for use in simulations or reinforcement learning.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'pettingzoo.mpe.simple_crypto.simple_crypto', which loads environment classes or functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only performs an import and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; it only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a public, open-source library and a declaration of __all__ to specify exported symbols. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or any potentially malicious actions. There are no embedded secrets, obfuscated code, or other suspicious patterns. Given the simplicity and transparency, no malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, simple, and appears to be a standard import statement for environment components in a reinforcement learning framework. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
