  "purpose": "Import specific environment components from the pettingzoo library for a simple crypto environment.",
  "sources": "Import statement from pettingzoo.mpe.simple_crypto.simple_crypto",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow present in this minimal code",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports three objects (env, parallel_env, raw_env) from a module within pettingzoo, a known reinforcement learning environment library. It only exposes these objects via __all__, with no other code or data manipulation present. No suspicious or malicious behavior is observable. The code is straightforward and does not contain any obfuscated patterns or external network interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is typical for Python modules that expose specific functions or objects for external use.",
