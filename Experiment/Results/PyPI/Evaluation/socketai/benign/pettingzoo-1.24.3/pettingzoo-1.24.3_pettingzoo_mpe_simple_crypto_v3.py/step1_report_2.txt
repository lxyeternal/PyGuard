  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific environment objects from the pettingzoo.mpe.simple_crypto.simple_crypto module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing env, parallel_env, and raw_env from a third-party library.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no data processing or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted sources to critical sinks; only module imports and export definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three objects from an external package and defines an export list. It contains no logic, data handling, or network activity. The module appears to be a straightforward re-export, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple re-export of objects from an external library with no malicious or security risks evident. It serves as an interface or convenience module. Confidence is high that this is benign.",
