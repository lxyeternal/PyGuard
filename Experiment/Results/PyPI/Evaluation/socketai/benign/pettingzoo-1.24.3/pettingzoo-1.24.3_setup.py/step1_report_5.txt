{
  "purpose": "The script sets up the 'pettingzoo' Python package by retrieving its version from the package's __init__.py file and invoking setuptools.setup to prepare the package for distribution or installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the __init__.py file in the pettingzoo package to extract the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "Calls setuptools.setup, which does not directly process untrusted data; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads content from __init__.py and extracts the version string, then passes static data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code performs standard setup tasks with straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The script uses pathlib to determine the current directory, reads the package's __init__.py file to find the __version__ string, and uses setuptools to set up the package. The version extraction relies on parsing a line starting with __version__, which is typical. No external input is read at runtime, and no suspicious code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is detected. The process is standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads local files securely, extracts version information in a typical manner, and invokes setup without processing untrusted input.",
