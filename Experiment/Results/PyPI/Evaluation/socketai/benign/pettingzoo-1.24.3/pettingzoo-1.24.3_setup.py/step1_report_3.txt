{
  "purpose": "Set up the Python package 'pettingzoo' by retrieving its version and configuring the installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of the '__init__.py' file within the 'pettingzoo' directory to extract the version string.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools.setup() to initiate package setup; no untrusted data sinks that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Reads version information from the '__init__.py' file (source) and passes it to the setup function (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The version extraction logic is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a specific file ('pettingzoo/__init__.py') to extract version information by scanning for a line starting with '__version__'. The function get_version() reads the file content, splits it into lines, and returns the version string once found. The setup() function then uses this version. No user input, network access, or other potentially malicious activities are present. The code follows typical package setup procedures without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard setup process for a Python package, extracting version info and calling setuptools.setup(). There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
