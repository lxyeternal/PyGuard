{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the pettingzoo Python package by retrieving its version and invoking setuptools.setup.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of pettingzoo/__init__.py to extract the __version__ string.",
  "sinks": "Calls setuptools.setup with package name and version, which are standard for package installation.",
  "flows": "Reads __init__.py content (source) to extract version; passes name and version to setup (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed. The version extraction is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script loads the current directory path, reads the __init__.py file to find the __version__ variable, and then runs setup with package name and retrieved version. The process is standard and does not include any suspicious behavior. No input from untrusted sources other than reading local files, and no network or secret handling is involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The only potential concern is if the __init__.py file contains malicious or manipulated version data, but that is outside the scope of this code review.",
