{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the pettingzoo Python package by retrieving its version from the package's __init__.py file and passing it to setuptools for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads the content of 'pettingzoo/__init__.py' to extract the version information.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or execute untrusted data, nor does it send data over the network. It primarily reads local files and calls setup.",
  "flows": "The code reads 'pettingzoo/__init__.py' to get the version, then passes this to setup() as part of the installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code detected. The process of extracting a version string from a __init__.py file is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pathlib for filesystem operations and setuptools for package setup. It defines a function to read the package's __init__.py to extract the __version__ variable. The version is then used in the setup() function call. All operations involve local file reading and standard setup procedures without external data inputs, unsafe code execution, or network activity. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
