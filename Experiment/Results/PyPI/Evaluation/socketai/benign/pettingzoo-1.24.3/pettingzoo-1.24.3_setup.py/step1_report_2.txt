  "purpose": "Setup script for the pettingzoo Python project, primarily to retrieve the project version and invoke setuptools to package the project.",
  "sources": "Reading the content of '__init__.py' in the 'pettingzoo' directory.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input or perform potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "The script reads version info from a file and passes it to setup(), with no data flowing from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious constructs; the code performs standard setup operations. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function to extract the project version from a specific file by parsing lines for '__version__'. It then calls 'setup()' with this version. All operations are straightforward and typical for a Python package setup script. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is clean, readable, and standard for such tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It reads the version from a file and calls setuptools.setup() accordingly. There are no indications of malicious activity or security risks present in this script.",
