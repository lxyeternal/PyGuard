{
  "purpose": "To re-export specific environment components from the pettingzoo.mpe.simple_reference.simple_reference module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'env', 'parallel_env', and 'raw_env' from a third-party library.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks present; no sinks for untrusted data identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely import/export statements.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains only import statements and an export list; no anomalies, malicious patterns, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three identifiers from an external library module and defines an explicit __all__ list for exports. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or other potentially malicious actions. The use of standard import syntax and explicit exports suggests straightforward module design without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module re-exporting specific environment components from a third-party library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It appears safe and typical for Python package structure.",
