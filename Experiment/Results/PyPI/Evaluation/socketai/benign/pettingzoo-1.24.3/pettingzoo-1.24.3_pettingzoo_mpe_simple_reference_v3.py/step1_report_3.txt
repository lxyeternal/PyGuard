  "purpose": "Exporting specific environment objects from the pettingzoo library module for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Import statement for pettingzoo.mpe.simple_reference.simple_reference",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only imports and exports identifiers",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscated logic, no unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import and export statement, importing environment objects from a well-known open-source library (pettingzoo). There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or security-sensitive code. It simply exposes certain environment objects for use in other modules, which is standard practice. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module re-export with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies detected.",
