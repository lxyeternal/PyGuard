  "purpose": "Re-export specific environment components from the pettingzoo.mpe.simple_reference module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from pettingzoo.mpe.simple_reference.simple_reference",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication",
  "flows": "Import of env, parallel_env, raw_env from the source module",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export with no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports three objects from a trusted open-source library and defines __all__ for module exports. It contains no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code pattern is standard for Python modules. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign module re-export with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature and assign appropriate scores. No modifications or further security review are necessary.",
