{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific environment classes or functions from a submodule of the pettingzoo library, likely to expose them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from pettingzoo.mpe.simple_reference.simple_reference",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present in the code",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets up module exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple import and export statements only",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a known open-source library, exposing specific environment components for external use. There are no signs of data manipulation, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code. The __all__ list clearly defines what is exported by this module, indicating good coding practice. No credentials, external network calls, or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module that simply re-exports certain objects from a library. No malicious activity, suspicious behavior, or security risks are identified.",
