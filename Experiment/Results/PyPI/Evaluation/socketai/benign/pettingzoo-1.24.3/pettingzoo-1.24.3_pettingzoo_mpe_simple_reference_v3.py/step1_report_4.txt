  "purpose": "Import specific environment classes or functions from a submodule of the pettingzoo library for reinforcement learning environments.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'env', 'parallel_env', and 'raw_env' from 'pettingzoo.mpe.simple_reference.simple_reference'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only imports modules and sets __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three objects from a well-known open-source reinforcement learning environment library. It also defines the __all__ list for explicit exports. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, obfuscated parts, or suspicious behavior. The imported package is public and widely used for RL research, with no signs of malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, data leakage, or malicious code flow detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement from an open-source library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
