  "purpose": "Import environment components from the pettingzoo library for reinforcement learning setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from pettingzoo.mpe.simple_world_comm.simple_world_comm module.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Importing modules without data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a reputable open-source library, exporting specific environment components via __all__. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and security risk is minimal. One report assigns a securityRisk of 0.1, which is slightly overestimated given the simplicity; it should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard, benign import statement with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security concerns. All assessments and scores are appropriate, with minor adjustment recommended for the securityRisk score in one report.",
