  "sources": "os, sys, re, unittest.mock.MagicMock, eli5.__version__",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no direct data sinks or external communication functions",
  "flows": "Importing modules, defining mock modules, updating sys.modules, setting up Sphinx configuration and themes",
  "anomalies": "Mock class used to replace multiple modules; no actual code execution or data handling; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials",
  "analysis": "The script mainly sets up a Sphinx documentation environment, mocking several heavy or external modules to prevent import errors. It does not execute or load untrusted data, nor does it include network operations, file manipulations, or external system commands. The use of MagicMock for modules such as 'lightning', 'sklearn_crfsuite', and multiple keras and matplotlib submodules is typical for documentation builds where actual modules are not needed. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The only potentially noteworthy aspect is the extensive module mocking, which is a common practice and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration with module mocking to facilitate documentation generation. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign setup script with no suspicious anomalies.",
