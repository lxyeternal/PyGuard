{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to generate explanations for lightning estimators' weights and predictions, supporting various classifier and regressor models.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data indirectly through the functions that explain model weights and predictions, but there are no explicit data input or network sources present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to data leaks, code injection, or other vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling explanation functions with models and data, which then generate explanations; however, there is no data flow that leads to external systems or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard Python features such as decorators, dispatch functions, and model registration, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs. No malicious backdoors or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly defines a set of functions to handle explanations for various sklearn-based models, specifically for lightning estimators. It registers explanation functions for different classifier and regressor models, supporting both standard and lightning-specific explainability. The functions return structured explanations or error messages for unsupported models. There are no data input sources, network operations, or sensitive operations; the code's structure appears standard and intended for explanation purposes. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate explanation utility for lightning estimators, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It solely focuses on registering and dispatching explanation functions for supported models.",
