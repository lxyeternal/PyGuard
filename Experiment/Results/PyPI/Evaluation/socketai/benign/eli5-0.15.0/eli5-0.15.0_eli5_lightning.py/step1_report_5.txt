{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for explaining the weights and predictions of lightning estimators, including support for classifiers and regressors, using the eli5 library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from estimator objects, function parameters (estimator, doc, target names, feature names, etc.), and dispatching functions based on class types.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any obvious sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or harmful actions. It mainly processes objects and returns explanation objects.",
  "flows": "Inputs from estimator objects and parameters flow through dispatch functions and are passed to explanation functions; no data leaves the system or interacts with external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL calls, or malicious backdoors are present. The code relies on standard library functions and well-defined dispatching.",
  "analysis": "The script registers explanation functions for various estimator types, mainly wrapping existing eli5 explanation methods. It dispatches explanations based on estimator class and supports nested classifiers like OneVsRestClassifier. No external network calls, file operations, or code execution are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are observed. The code appears to be a standard extension for model explanations, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension to the eli5 library for explaining lightning estimators. It primarily dispatches explanation functions and does not include any malicious or maliciously intended behavior. No security risks or malware indicators are identified.",
