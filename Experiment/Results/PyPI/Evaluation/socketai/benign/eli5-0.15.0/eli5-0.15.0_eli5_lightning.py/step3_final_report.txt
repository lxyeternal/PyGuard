{
  "purpose": "Provides explanation functions for Lightning estimators, supporting classification and regression models, including multi-class via OneVsRestClassifier, using dispatching and registration for interpretability.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, class attributes, and imported libraries; no external data input/output or system interactions.",
  "sinks": "Returns Explanation objects; no external data leaks, network calls, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Dispatches explanation functions from models to specific handlers; no external data flow or system effect.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code registers explanation functions for various model types, using standard Python features such as decorators and dispatch. It does not perform any external system interactions, data leaks, or malicious operations. The logic is straightforward, aimed solely at interpretability, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of explanation utilities for Lightning estimators. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
