{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions for explaining the weights and predictions of Lightning estimators, including support for various classifiers and regressors, and handling of multi-class classifiers via OneVsRestClassifier.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from estimator objects, method calls, and class attributes such as estimator.__class__ and clf.estimator.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that handle untrusted input data, nor does it perform any data leaks, network operations, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The flow involves dispatching explanation functions based on estimator types and classifiers, primarily invoking existing eli5 explanation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual dynamic code execution are present. The code relies on standard library functions and known explanation libraries without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides wrapper functions for explanation generation, dispatching based on estimator types and classifier structures. It registers explanations for supported classifier and regressor classes, ensuring correct explanation functions are called. There is no evidence of malicious logic, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The code appears to be a typical implementation of model explanation utilities, structured using standard Python features like decorators and class attribute access. No anomalies, hidden backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The use of external libraries is legitimate and consistent with explanation tasks. Overall, the code maintains standard practices and does not exhibit signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of explanation utility functions for Lightning estimators, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily facilitates model interpretability without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
