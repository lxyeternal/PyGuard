  "purpose": "This code provides explanation functions for lightning estimators, integrating with eli5 to offer interpretability for classification and regression models.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'lightning.impl.base', 'lightning', 'sklearn.multiclass', 'eli5.base', 'eli5.base_utils', 'eli5.sklearn', 'eli5.explain'; no user input or external data read; no environment variables accessed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output functions that could leak data; no network, file I/O, or environment variable usage detected.",
  "flows": "Function calls dispatching to explanation methods based on estimator types, primarily handling model objects and classification/regression classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution; straightforward registration of classifiers and regressors with corresponding explanation functions.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up explanation functions for specific model types using multiple dispatch, registering different estimators for interpretability via eli5. It handles unsupported estimators gracefully with error explanations. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious logic observed. All operations are standard for model explanation utilities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for model explanation with no malicious intent or security risks. It mainly registers explanation functions for various estimator classes and provides error handling for unsupported models. No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities detected.",
