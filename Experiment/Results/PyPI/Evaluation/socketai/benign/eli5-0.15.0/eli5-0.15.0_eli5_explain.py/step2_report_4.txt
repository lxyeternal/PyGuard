  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and intended for model interpretability.\n- No external system interactions, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The functions are default placeholders that return an Explanation with the estimator's string representation and an unsupported estimator message.\n- The code uses standard Python patterns, with no obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validity of the Reports\n\n**1. Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n- The code does **not** perform any malicious activity.\n- It simply dispatches to unspecified implementations or returns a default Explanation indicating unsupported estimators.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the logic.\n- The reports correctly identify that the functions are placeholders or default implementations, with no data processing or external calls.\n\n**2. Malware and obfuscation scores:**\n- All reports assign `malware=0` and `obfuscated=0`, which is appropriate.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malware are present.\n\n**3. Security risk:**\n- The code does not pose any security risk; all reports assign `securityRisk=0`.\n\n**4. Functionality and reasoning:**\n- The functions are designed as dispatchers, not actual implementations.\n- The explanations are placeholders, which is standard for unimplemented or unsupported estimator types.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation of scores and reasoning\n\n- The **confidence** scores are high (mostly 1), which is justified given the clear benign nature.\n- The **malware** scores are correctly 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- The **obfuscated** scores are correctly 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- The **securityRisk** scores are correctly 0.\n\n**Any adjustments?**\n- Since all evidence points to benign, placeholder code, the scores are appropriate.\n- The reports are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Potential claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions\n- No report suggests any assumptions that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n- The code's purpose is clear, and no hidden behaviors are implied.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment and personal estimates\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Justification:**\n- The code is a simple dispatch pattern, returning placeholder explanations.\n- No external system interactions, data leaks, or malicious code.\n- The purpose is interpretability, not data processing or system control.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n- **The reports are accurate and thorough.**\n- **Scores are appropriate and justified.**\n- **No changes needed.**\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n- The code is safe and benign, serving as a default or placeholder implementation in a model interpretability library.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always monitor for future extensions that might add actual implementation logic, which could introduce risks. But as it stands, this code is safe.",
