  "purpose": "Default dispatch functions for explanation of estimators and predictions, serving as placeholders for specific implementations.",
  "sources": "Estimator object passed as parameter, no external data or system input.",
  "sinks": "Returns Explanation object containing string representation of estimator; no data leaks or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Input estimator -> repr(estimator) -> Explanation object -> return",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; straightforward placeholder functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two generic functions decorated with @singledispatch, returning Explanation objects with the estimator's repr and an unsupported message. No malicious behavior, external system calls, or data leaks are present. The functions are simple placeholders meant for extension. The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard Python features. No obfuscation or security issues are evident. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign, default nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, default implementation for explanation functions, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify its purpose and safety. The assigned scores are justified and accurate.",
