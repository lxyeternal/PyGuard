{
  "purpose": "The code provides explanation functions for estimators, mainly for interpreting models and predictions in machine learning workflows.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'estimator' object and 'doc' parameter; no explicit input reading from external sources or untrusted user inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is written to external systems, network, or files, nor is there code that could leak data.",
  "flows": "The functions simply create and return Explanation objects with minimal processing; no complex data flow or untrusted data propagation is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual code patterns. It relies on standard library and eli5 modules; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines dispatch functions for model explanation, which are placeholders that return simple Explanation objects indicating unsupported estimators. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or potentially malicious actions. All code adheres to standard practices and contains no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for model explanation with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a straightforward implementation of dispatch functions, mainly serving as placeholders. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
