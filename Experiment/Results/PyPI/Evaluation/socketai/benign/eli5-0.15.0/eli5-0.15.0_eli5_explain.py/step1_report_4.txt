{
  "purpose": "Provide explanation functions for estimator classes, specifically for feature weights and prediction explanations, used in model interpretability.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'eli5.base' and 'eli5.base_utils'. Function parameters such as 'estimator', 'doc', and various keyword arguments.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of Explanation objects with repr(estimator), which converts the estimator object to a string. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (estimator, doc, kwargs) are used to generate Explanation objects. The main flow involves converting the estimator to its string representation for the Explanation.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not perform any file, network, or system operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions with the @singledispatch decorator, dispatching based on the type of 'estimator'. Both functions generate an Explanation object containing the string representation of the estimator and a generic error message if the estimator type is unsupported. The functions include comprehensive docstrings explaining parameters and usage, but do not perform any malicious actions, data leaks, or suspicious operations. There are no signs of obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of model explanation helpers, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply converts objects to strings and creates explanation objects, serving interpretability purposes. Overall, it appears safe.",
