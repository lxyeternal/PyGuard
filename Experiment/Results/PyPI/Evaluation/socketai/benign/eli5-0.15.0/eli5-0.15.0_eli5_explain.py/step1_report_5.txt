{
  "purpose": "Define explanation functions for estimator models in the eli5 library, facilitating interpretation of model weights and predictions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read; functions accept parameters and estimator objects as input.",
  "sinks": "The functions primarily return Explanation objects with string representations of estimators. No data is written to external systems or network.",
  "flows": "Input estimator objects are converted to strings via repr(), then used in constructing Explanation objects with error messages. No untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard Python features, and no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two generic dispatch functions, explain_weights and explain_prediction, which primarily generate Explanation objects with a message indicating unsupported estimator types. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data exfiltration is present. The code relies on standard library and eli5 modules, with no unusual logic or potentially malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign implementation of explanation stubs for a model interpretation library. It does not contain malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity. The primary purpose is to provide a framework for further extensions tailored to specific estimators.",
