  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code explains XGBoost model weights and importance, reading model objects and data inputs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external network or data leaks; explanation outputs are local.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard, well-structured explanation utility. No malicious behavior or malicious intent is evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low, routine explanation code).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion that the code is safe and legitimate is justified. The low security risk score aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar explanation functions, involving model dump parsing and feature importance.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external network activity; data flows are internal.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical model explanation tool, with standard libraries and practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (routine).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion that the code is safe is consistent. No malicious indicators are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Explains features and predictions, using model internals.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No harmful external actions; uses model prediction methods.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate explanation utility, with routine version warnings.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (still very low).\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion that the code is safe and intended for explanation purposes is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar explanation functions, involving model dump parsing and feature importance.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious actions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard model explanation code, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior and structure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Explains model decisions, handling data and model internals.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external network activity; explanation outputs are local.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical, safe interpretability module.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion of safety and legitimacy is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** No signs of obfuscation.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports consistently assign 0, which aligns with the code's purpose.\n- **Security risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final expert estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — minimal, routine explanation code with no security concerns.\n\n**My reasoned estimate:**  \n**Malware: 0**  \n**Obfuscated: 0**  \n**Risk: 0.1** — very low, routine explanation code with negligible security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent and justified in their assessments. The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation for explaining XGBoost models, with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior.",
