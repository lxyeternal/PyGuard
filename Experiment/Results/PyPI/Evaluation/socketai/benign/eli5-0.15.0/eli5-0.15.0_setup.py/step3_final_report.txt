{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, reading version info and descriptions from static files.",
  "sources": "Reads version from __init__.py, reads README.rst and CHANGES.rst files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static file reads with no external input.",
  "flows": "Static file reads without untrusted input; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or anomalies; minor missing context managers in file handling, but not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with straightforward static file reading and package configuration. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code detected. Regex usage for version extraction is standard. Minor code style issue with open() not using context managers, but this does not impact security. No signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, standard package setup file with no malicious intent or security risks. The only improvement could be adopting context managers for file handling, but this is a best practice, not a security concern.",
