  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the eli5 Python project, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading files (__init__.py, README.rst, CHANGES.rst) to extract version and description information.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "Reading version info from __init__.py to include in package metadata; reading long descriptions from documentation files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context managers for README and CHANGES files; potential file handling issues but no malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setup procedures for a Python package, extracting version info via regex from a source file, and reading documentation files for long description. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python setup scripts. The only minor concern is the lack of context managers for file reading, which is a best practice but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It properly defines package metadata and dependencies without any suspicious operations.",
