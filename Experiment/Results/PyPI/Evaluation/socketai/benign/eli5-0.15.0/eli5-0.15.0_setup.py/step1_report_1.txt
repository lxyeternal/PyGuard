  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the eli5 Python project, including reading version info and long descriptions.",
  "sources": "Reading version from '__init__.py', reading 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' files.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute or handle untrusted data; no network, file write, or environment variable usage beyond reading static files.",
  "flows": "Reading version and description files during setup; no flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious patterns observed. The code is straightforward and typical for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions to extract version info and long description content, then calls 'setup()' with project metadata and dependencies. All file reads are from static files packaged with the project, with no user input or external untrusted sources involved. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no credential handling, and no obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
