  "purpose": "This script is used to set up and configure the 'eli5' Python package, including retrieving version information and long description content for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'eli5/__init__.py', reading 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' files for long description.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data outputs or network operations.",
  "flows": "File reads (sources) lead to package configuration, with no flow to potentially dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present. Functions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to read package metadata and setup configuration. It reads static files and regex extracts version info. The setup() call uses this data to prepare the package. No user input, network calls, or malicious constructs are present. The code is typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It reads static files and configures package metadata securely.",
