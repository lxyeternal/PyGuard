{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the 'eli5' Python package, used for packaging and distribution on PyPI.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from files: '__init__.py' to extract version, 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the script writes data only to the setup function parameters, which are controlled internally.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading version info from a source file and description data from documentation files, then passing them to the setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The use of regex to extract version is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup operations: reading version info via regex from a source file, reading description files, and configuring package metadata. All file operations are straightforward and do not involve untrusted input. The dependencies are standard and do not suggest malicious intent. No code injection, external network calls, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads files safely and only constructs setup parameters.",
