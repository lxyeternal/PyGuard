  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the same utility function `transform_feature_names` that uses `singledispatch` to retrieve feature names from scikit-learn transformers.\n- They consistently note that the function checks for the presence of `get_feature_names_out()` method and calls it if available; otherwise, it raises `NotImplementedError`.\n- All reports conclude that the code is straightforward, standard, and harmless, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The confidence scores are uniformly high (1.0), and malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all zero.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code performs attribute checks and method calls on transformer objects, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The logic is correct, and the implementation aligns with standard practices.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The malware and security risk scores are 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. The risk score is also 0, indicating no security concern.\n\n- **Justification for higher scores?**  \n  No, given the benign analysis, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n- **Malware score reflection?**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious activity—no network calls, no data leaks, no code injection, no obfuscation—so malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All assessments are based on straightforward code analysis.\n\n- **Consistency of scores?**  \n  Yes. The scores align with the code's nature as a harmless utility function.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard utility function with no security concerns.** It is well-structured, uses common Python patterns, and performs simple attribute checks and method calls.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI agree with the provided reports. The code is benign, and no adjustments to the scores are necessary.",
