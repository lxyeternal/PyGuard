{
  "purpose": "Define a utility function for obtaining feature names from scikit-learn transformers, supporting custom handling via singledispatch.",
  "sources": "Code reads the 'transformer' parameter and accesses its 'get_feature_names_out' attribute if available.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or data leak points; no external network interactions or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'transformer' flows to a check for 'get_feature_names_out' method; if present, it's called, otherwise an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard Python features and library functions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic function 'transform_feature_names' with a default implementation that calls 'get_feature_names_out' if it exists on the transformer object, otherwise raises an exception. The code uses standard library 'singledispatch' for extensibility. No external inputs other than the 'transformer' parameter are processed, and no output or external network calls are present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for feature name extraction in a machine learning context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function intended to work with scikit-learn transformers for feature name extraction. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It is well-structured and does not pose security risks.",
