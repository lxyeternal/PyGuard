{
  "purpose": "Provide a utility function for obtaining feature names from scikit-learn transformers, supporting customization via singledispatch.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'transformer' object and its attributes, as well as optional 'in_names' parameter.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; function mainly performs attribute checks and method calls on objects.",
  "flows": "Input 'transformer' is checked for method 'get_feature_names_out', which is then called if available.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward utility function with standard Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic function 'transform_feature_names' using singledispatch to handle different transformer classes. It checks if the transformer has the method 'get_feature_names_out' and calls it; otherwise, it raises an exception. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated logic are present. Usage is limited to attribute checks and method calls, typical of library code. No external network activity or file manipulation is evident. The code appears to be a legitimate utility intended for scikit-learn model explanations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless utility for extracting feature names from transformers, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
