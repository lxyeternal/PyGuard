{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility function for handling feature name transformations in scikit-learn pipelines, aiding explanations and feature importance analysis.",
  "sources": "It reads the 'transformer' parameter to determine if it has 'get_feature_names_out' method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process external input beyond parameters.",
  "flows": "It checks for a method on 'transformer' and calls it if available; otherwise, raises an error.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The use of 'singledispatch' is standard for method overloading.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic function with a default implementation that retrieves feature names from a transformer object. It includes a safety check for the method 'get_feature_names_out' and raises an exception if not present. No external input handling, network activity, or malicious patterns are observed. The code appears to be straightforward utility code for machine learning pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility function for feature name handling in scikit-learn pipelines, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured and uses conventional patterns without any suspicious elements.",
