  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Confirmation & Issues**:  \nAll reports agree that the code is a straightforward utility function for extracting feature names from scikit-learn transformers, using `singledispatch` to support multiple transformer types. The core logic involves checking for the presence of `get_feature_names_out()` and calling it if available, otherwise raising `NotImplementedError`. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are identified in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes**:  \nThe reports do not identify any logical errors or flaws. The code appears correct and well-structured for its purpose. It handles the absence of `get_feature_names_out()` gracefully by raising an exception, which is appropriate.\n\n3. **Scores Given & Justification**:  \nAll reports assign scores of 1 for confidence and 0 for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk. This is consistent with the analysis—there are no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation, and the code is a standard utility.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores**:  \n- **Risk score**: 0, as the code is benign and intended for model explanation purposes.  \n- **Malware score**: 0, no malicious intent or behavior is present.  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0, the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n5. **Challenging Assumptions & Claims**:  \nThe reports correctly challenge any assumptions of malicious intent, noting the absence of suspicious patterns, external network activity, or handling of untrusted data.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:  \nThe scores are consistent with the code and analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: **0** — No malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score**: **0** — Code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk score**: **0** — No security risks identified; this is a utility function for model explanation.\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard, harmless utility for extracting feature names from scikit-learn transformers, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The consistent analysis across reports supports this conclusion.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign and well-structured.  \n- No security concerns or malicious activity are evident.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
