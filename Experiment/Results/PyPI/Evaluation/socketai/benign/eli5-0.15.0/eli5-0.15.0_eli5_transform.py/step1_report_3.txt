{
  "purpose": "Define a generic function to obtain feature names from transformers, with support for custom implementations via singledispatch.",
  "sources": "Imports from eli5.base_utils, usage of hasattr and get_feature_names_out method, function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as no untrusted data handling or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (transformer, in_names) flow into logic that calls get_feature_names_out, or raise exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and consistent with standard practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a utility for dispatching functions based on the class type. It defines a function to retrieve feature names from a transformer, defaulting to calling get_feature_names_out if available, otherwise raising NotImplementedError. No external data sources, no network operations, and no handling of sensitive information are present. Usage appears standard for a machine learning feature extraction pipeline.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for handling transformer feature names with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.",
