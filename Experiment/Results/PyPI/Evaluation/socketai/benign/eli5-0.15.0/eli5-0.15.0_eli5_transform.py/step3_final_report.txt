  "purpose": "Utility function to retrieve feature names from scikit-learn transformers, supporting multiple transformer classes via singledispatch.",
  "sources": "Checks for 'get_feature_names_out' attribute on transformer object.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'get_feature_names_out()' method if present; raises NotImplementedError if absent.",
  "flows": "Input transformer object -> attribute check -> method call or exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward attribute check and method invocation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic function using singledispatch to obtain feature names from transformers. It checks if the transformer has 'get_feature_names_out' and calls it if available; otherwise, it raises an exception. The logic is standard, with no suspicious or malicious patterns. It relies on common Python and scikit-learn conventions, performing attribute checks and method calls. No external network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The code is a benign utility for model explanation pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility function with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
