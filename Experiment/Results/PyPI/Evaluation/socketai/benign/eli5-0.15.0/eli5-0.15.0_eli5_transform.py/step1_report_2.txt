{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility function for handling feature name transformations within explanation pipelines, specifically tailored for scikit-learn transformers.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'transformer' parameter, checking for the 'get_feature_names_out' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data leading to data leaks or harmful effects are present.",
  "flows": "The function checks for a method on 'transformer' and calls it if available; otherwise, it raises an exception.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are detected. The code is straightforward and consistent with typical utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a generic function 'transform_feature_names' using 'singledispatch' for various transformer types. It checks if the transformer has the 'get_feature_names_out' method and calls it if present, else raises NotImplementedError. There is no input/output injection, no network activity, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard utility function for feature name handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for feature name handling in scikit-learn pipelines, with no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscated elements. It serves its intended purpose without security concerns.",
