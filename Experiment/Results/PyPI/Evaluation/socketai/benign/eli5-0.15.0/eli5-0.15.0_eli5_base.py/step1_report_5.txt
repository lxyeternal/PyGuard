{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for explanations and feature importances in machine learning model interpretability.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules (numpy, typing, and relative imports from the package). No data input sources are explicitly handled in this code.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code mainly defines classes and data structures without performing data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily object initialization and data encapsulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are evident. The code uses standard class definitions with type annotations and data encapsulation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of class definitions decorated with @attrs, used for representing explanations, feature importances, and decision tree structures in an ML interpretability context. There are no functions performing input/output, network communication, or file handling. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious data handling mechanisms are present. The code is straightforward, intended for data storage and formatting purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of data structures for a machine learning explanation library. No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are detected based on the code provided.",
