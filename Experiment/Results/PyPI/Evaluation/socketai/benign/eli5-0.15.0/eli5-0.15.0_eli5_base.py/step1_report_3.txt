{
  "purpose": "Define data structures and classes used for explanations, feature importances, target explanations, and decision tree representations in a machine learning interpretability context.",
  "sources": "No external input reading; class initializers and property assignments only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs; no network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow involving untrusted input; the code primarily sets attributes and constructs objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be standard data structure definitions with no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions decorated with @attrs for representing explanations, feature importances, target explanations, weighted spans, decision trees, and nodes. It uses standard Python type annotations, optional attributes, and simple attribute initializations. There are no external data reads, no network connections, no command executions, or other suspicious activities. The code focuses on structured data storage for interpretability tools, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. All data flows are contained within class property assignments, with no untrusted input handling or external communication. The code does not include any obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely structural, defining data containers for interpretability and visualization purposes. It does not exhibit any malicious intent or suspicious activity. The code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
