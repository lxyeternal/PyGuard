{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for explanations, feature importances, target explanations, and decision tree information used in a model interpretability library.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules (numpy, typing) and internal modules (.base_utils, .formatters). No input reading or data acquisition present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points to external systems, network, or file operations. No untrusted data handling or output is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows are primarily within object attributes; no external data transmission or processing from untrusted sources detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors such as code execution, dynamic evaluation, or obfuscated code. Usage of @attrs is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or privacy-violating behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with constructor methods and type annotations, designed for model explanation structures. No input handling, network operations, file I/O, or malicious logic present. No indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or other malicious activities. The code appears to be purely declarative data modeling with standard usage of attrs and type hints.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is a set of data structures for model explanations and visualization, with no suspicious or malicious logic detected.",
