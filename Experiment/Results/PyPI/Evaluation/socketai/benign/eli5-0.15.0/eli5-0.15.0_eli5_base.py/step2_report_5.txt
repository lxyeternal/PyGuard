  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the security implications, correctness, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a set of data classes for explanations, feature importances, decision trees, and visualization components.\n- They emphasize that the code involves only class definitions, attributes, and optional parameters.\n- No external data sources, network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution are mentioned.\n- The code appears to be purely structural, with no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code matches the descriptions: it defines data structures with no executable logic beyond attribute initialization.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n- The code relies on standard practices: use of `@attrs`, type annotations, optional attributes.\n- No risky patterns such as eval, exec, or untrusted input handling are present.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is purely structural and contains no security risks.\n\n### Justification for risk score > 0.5:\n- None of the reports suggest any reason to assign a higher risk score. The code is safe, with no external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious intent.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the code's nature.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is only for data modeling and visualization, which is accurate.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious activity are made or implied.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of data classes for interpretability purposes. No security concerns or malicious behaviors are detected.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- The code is purely structural, with no executable logic that could be malicious.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate.\n- No modifications or escalations are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk. The code is safe and well within acceptable security parameters.",
