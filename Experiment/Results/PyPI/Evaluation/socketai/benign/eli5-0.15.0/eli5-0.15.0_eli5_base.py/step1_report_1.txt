{
  "purpose": "Define data structures and classes for explanations, feature importances, target explanations, weighted spans, decision tree info, and related components used in model interpretability and visualization.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only class attributes and optional parameters; no input or environment variable reads.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous sinks such as network calls, file writes, or command execution; no untrusted data handling that could lead to data leakage or command injection.",
  "flows": "Data flows are internal within class attributes; no untrusted input flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a set of data classes decorated with @attrs for modeling explanations, feature importance, decision tree structure, and visualization elements. It relies on standard Python typing, numpy arrays, and imported modules for formatting and visualization. No network or file operations are performed. No external inputs, environment variables, or untrusted sources are handled. The code appears to be purely structural and descriptive without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of data structures for explanation and visualization in model interpretability tools. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is safe for use.",
