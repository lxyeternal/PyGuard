  "purpose": "Defines data structures for explanations, feature importances, decision trees, and visualization components in interpretability tools.",
  "sources": "Class attribute initializations, optional parameters, and internal attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, no system calls, no network I/O, no file operations.",
  "flows": "Internal attribute assignments within class constructors; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions decorated with @attrs, serving as data containers for interpretability. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or network operations. Imports are from project-specific modules, but no malicious behavior is indicated. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, structural data classes with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All signals and reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The code is suitable for use without concerns.",
