{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for explanations, feature importances, and decision tree visualization in a machine learning interpretability library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to class constructors, class attributes, and imported modules/functions.",
  "sinks": "None evident. No data is read from untrusted sources or written to external systems within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal attribute assignment and class method processing; no external data flow or untrusted input handling is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code primarily consists of class definitions with no executable logic that could conceal malicious intent. The import from '.base_utils' and formatters appears benign; no dynamic execution or suspicious string manipulations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple data classes using @attrs for representing explanations, feature importances, target explanations, and decision tree structures. There are no functions that execute system commands, handle untrusted input, or perform network communication. The only imported modules are standard and project-specific utilities. The class constructors and attributes are straightforward, with no apparent dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The code does not include any suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, data exfiltration, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily sets up data structures for a machine learning interpretability framework. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It appears to be safe and consistent with standard data modeling patterns for explanatory tools.",
