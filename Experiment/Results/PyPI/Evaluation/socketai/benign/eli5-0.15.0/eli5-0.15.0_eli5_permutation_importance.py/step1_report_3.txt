{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for computing feature importances via permutation importance, used in model interpretability tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as X and y, and uses sklearn.utils.check_random_state for randomness control.",
  "sinks": "The code computes scores using a provided score function; no direct data leaks or insecure outputs are observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (X, y) is processed to generate shuffled versions of X; score_func is called on these shuffled datasets; score differences are calculated to determine feature importance.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data handling are present. Use of standard libraries and well-documented functions without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements permutation importance by shuffling features and measuring score decreases. The function iter_shuffled creates mutable copies of X with shuffled columns, either pre-shuffled or on-the-fly. get_score_importances computes the baseline score and multiple permutations for robustness. The internal function _get_scores_shufled performs the shuffling and scoring for each permutation. All operations involve standard data handling and randomness, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of permutation feature importance, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It relies on standard libraries and practices, and performs data processing securely. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are present.",
