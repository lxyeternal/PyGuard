{
  "purpose": "This module implements permutation importance for feature importance measurement in machine learning models, based on score decrease when features are shuffled.",
  "sources": "Reads input data X and labels y, and uses a score function (score_func) which may be user-defined; also reads from random_state for randomness control.",
  "sinks": "The score_func may process data internally; no direct data leakage sinks identified. No network, file I/O, or system modification detected.",
  "flows": "Input data X and y are passed to score_func; features are shuffled by iter_shuffled, then score_func is called on shuffled datasets to measure impact.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code performs standard permutation importance calculations, with clear, well-documented functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to generate permutations of features in dataset X, then computes the decrease in scoring metric when features are shuffled. Uses sklearn utility for randomness. No suspicious behavior, external network calls, or data exfiltration observed. The functions are standard for permutation importance and do not contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of permutation feature importance. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks identified. It appears safe and intended for legitimate model interpretability tasks.",
