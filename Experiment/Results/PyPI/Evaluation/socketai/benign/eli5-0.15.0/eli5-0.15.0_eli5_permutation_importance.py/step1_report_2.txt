{
  "purpose": "This code implements permutation importance for feature importance analysis in machine learning models, providing functions to shuffle features and evaluate score decreases.",
  "sources": "Reads input data X and labels y, and a score function score_func.",
  "sinks": "Uses score_func outputs, but no untrusted data sinks or data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input (X, y) into score_func, with feature shuffling happening in iter_shuffled, and results aggregated in get_score_importances.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious data handling are detected. The code primarily manipulates data for analysis purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for shuffling features and computing feature importance scores through permutation. It imports standard libraries, uses scikit-learn utilities, and performs data copying and shuffling operations. No suspicious or malicious behaviors like network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. Functions are well-structured and serve legitimate purposes related to feature importance calculation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign implementation of permutation feature importance analysis without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It relies on standard libraries and methods for data manipulation and scoring, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
