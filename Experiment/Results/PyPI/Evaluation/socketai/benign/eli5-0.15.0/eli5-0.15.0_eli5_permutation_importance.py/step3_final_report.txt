  "purpose": "Implementation of permutation importance by measuring score decrease when features are shuffled, following the methodology described in Breiman's 'Random Forests'.",
  "sources": "Input data X, y; optional columns_to_shuffle; random_state for reproducibility.",
  "sinks": "Score function evaluations; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data is shuffled per feature, then scored; importance is derived from score differences.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in function name '_get_scores_shufled', but no security impact.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard permutation importance calculations, shuffling specified columns, and evaluating scores. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The code relies on numpy and sklearn utilities, with no external network or data exfiltration. The typo in the internal function name is benign. The security implications are minimal; the code is transparent and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of permutation importance with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor typo does not affect security or functionality. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score should be 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
