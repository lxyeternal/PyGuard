{
  "purpose": "This module implements permutation importance to evaluate feature significance in predictive models by measuring score decreases when features are shuffled or removed.",
  "sources": "Inputs include the feature matrix X, target y, and optional parameters such as columns to shuffle, random state, and score function. Data is read from X and y, as well as from function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Score function outputs are used internally; no explicit sinks for untrusted data are evident. No data leakage, credential handling, or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from X and y into the score function, with columns being shuffled in iter_shuffled, and results used to calculate score decreases, but no external data or network transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard permutation importance calculations; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious features.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for feature importance analysis via permutation importance. It includes input handling, shuffling mechanisms, and scoring functions. The functions are well-structured and do not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior. All data handling appears typical for a feature importance module, and there are no external network connections, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The use of numpy and sklearn utils aligns with standard practices. The only minor typo is in the internal function name '_get_scores_shufled' which is consistent with the misspelling but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of permutation feature importance with no malicious behavior detected. It functions as intended for model explanation purposes, without any signs of malware or security risks.",
