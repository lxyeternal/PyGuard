{
  "purpose": "The code implements permutation importance to measure feature importances by shuffling features and observing the impact on a scoring function.",
  "sources": "Input data X and labels y, as well as parameters like random_state, columns_to_shuffle, and score_func.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the score_func, which computes a score based on shuffled data; no untrusted data output or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input X and y through scoring functions, with features being shuffled and scores recalculated, then the importance is derived from score differences.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior are evident. The code uses standard libraries and follows typical permutation importance methodology.",
  "analysis": "The script defines functions for shuffling features in the dataset (iter_shuffled), calculating score importances (get_score_importances), and an internal helper for shuffling (._get_scores_shufled). It utilizes numpy and scikit-learn utilities without any suspicious or malicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or hidden behaviors are present. All operations are standard for feature importance computation, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of permutation feature importance with no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility for model interpretability.",
