  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code review:** The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports various functions and modules, handling optional dependencies with try-except blocks. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- **Malware/Malicious Behavior:** No signs of malicious activity. The exception handling is standard for optional dependencies.\n- **Risk & Malware scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the benign nature observed.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified given the straightforward, standard pattern.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment is accurate; no issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code review:** Similar to Report 1, with standard import patterns and exception handling.\n- **Potential concerns:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) due to the use of multiple optional dependencies, but these are only imported and not used maliciously.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correct.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, justified given the standard pattern and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior detected. The minor security risk score might reflect the potential for dependency issues but not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code review:** Consistent with previous reports; safe, standard import handling.\n- **Security considerations:** No network activity, data leaks, or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware remains 0; security risk is low (0.1), which is reasonable given the optional dependencies.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's assessment is appropriate; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code review:** Again, standard import pattern with exception handling.\n- **Potential concerns:** Use of try-except to suppress ImportError is common; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2—this is slightly higher but still reasonable considering the dependency management context.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues; the report correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Code review:** Same pattern—conditional imports with exception handling.\n- **Malicious activity:** None observed; no network or data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, security risk 0—appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1, justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report is accurate; no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the code's nature—standard import management.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above 0 in some reports (0.1 or 0.2), reflecting the dependency management complexity but not maliciousness.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the code's structure and the reports' findings, I concur with the assessments. The code is a typical, safe import management pattern for a Python package with optional dependencies, and there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for dependency management complexity but still low risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, well-structured, and free from malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate, and I agree with the reports' conclusions.",
