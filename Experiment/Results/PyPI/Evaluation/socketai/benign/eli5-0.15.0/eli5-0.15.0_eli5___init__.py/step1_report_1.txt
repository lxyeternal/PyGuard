{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to be part of a Python package that provides explanations for machine learning models and visualizations, managing imports from various optional dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and functions from local package files and conditionally from third-party libraries based on availability.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks are present. The code primarily handles imports and does not process untrusted input or output data.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from source to sink; the code manages module imports and conditional inclusion.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code uses standard Python import patterns with exception handling for optional dependencies. No suspicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically attempts to import multiple modules and functions, handling ImportError and other exceptions to ensure optional dependencies do not cause failures. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The pattern is typical for a package managing optional dependencies with safe exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical module initializer or import management script for a machine learning explanation package. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The exception handling for optional dependencies appears standard and safe. Overall, the code is benign.",
