  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Content Summary:** The report states the code is a benign module initializer managing optional dependencies, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code matches the description: it imports various modules conditionally, handling ImportError and other exceptions, with no signs of malicious code.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** The report assigns a risk of 0, malware of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate. No issues detected.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Content Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard import patterns, safe exception handling, and no malicious activity.\n- **Code Confirmation:** Consistent with the code; all exception handling is typical, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Risk is 0.1, malware 0, which is reasonable given the code's benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** Slightly lower (0.9), but still high.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Content Summary:** Reiterates the benign, modular import pattern, safe handling of optional dependencies, no malicious behavior.\n- **Code Confirmation:** Matches the code; no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Risk 0.1, malware 0, aligns well.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Content Summary:** Same pattern—conditional imports, no data leaks, no malicious activity.\n- **Code Confirmation:** Fully consistent.\n- **Scores:** Risk 0.2, malware 0, appropriate.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Content Summary:** Again, a standard dependency management pattern with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Code Confirmation:** Matches the code.\n- **Scores:** Risk 0, malware 0, fitting the benign nature.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code contains no malicious activity—no network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, reflecting the code's purpose as a safe dependency loader.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nThe code is a typical Python module that manages optional dependencies for a machine learning explanation package. It employs standard exception handling patterns, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The exception handling is designed to prevent import failures from crashing the package, which is a common and safe practice.\n\n### **Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** (a very low, acceptable risk level considering the context)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, well-structured, and safe. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
