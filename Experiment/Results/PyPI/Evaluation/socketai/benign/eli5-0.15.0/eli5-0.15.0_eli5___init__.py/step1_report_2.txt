{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that provides explanations for machine learning models and predictions, with multiple optional dependencies for various ML libraries and visualization tools.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements for various modules, including local modules and optional third-party libraries (e.g., pandas, xgboost, keras, openai).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system calls; it only imports modules conditionally.",
  "flows": "The code flows primarily through import statements and exception handling for optional dependencies, with no execution of untrusted input or sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behavior are present. Exception handling is straightforward and focused on missing modules.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes the package version, then attempts to import various modules, some of which are optional and guarded with try-except blocks to handle ImportError or other exceptions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are evident. The exception handling is standard for optional dependencies, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard modular import structure for a Python package with multiple optional dependencies. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data exfiltration, or security risks. It simply manages imports and handles missing dependencies gracefully.",
