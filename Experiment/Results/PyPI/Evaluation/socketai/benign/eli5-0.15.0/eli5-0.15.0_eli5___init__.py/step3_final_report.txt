  "purpose": "Manage optional dependencies for a Python package, importing modules conditionally with exception handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements within try-except blocks for various modules and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; only import statements and exception handling.",
  "flows": "Source: import statements; Sink: module import execution; Flow: conditional import execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad try-except blocks to silently ignore ImportError, which is standard for optional dependencies but could mask underlying issues.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard patterns for optional dependency management in Python, with multiple try-except blocks handling ImportError and other exceptions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. Exception handling is broad but typical, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk around 0.1) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code's purpose is purely to conditionally import modules, which is a common and safe practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module initializer for managing optional dependencies in a Python package. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect the low-risk, straightforward nature of the code.",
