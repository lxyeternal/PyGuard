{
  "purpose": "This code primarily loads various optional modules and functions related to model explanation and visualization, supporting multiple ML frameworks and formats.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and functions based on the availability of dependencies, which can be triggered by runtime import attempts.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling, external network calls, or sensitive data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements act as source points; no data flows from external sources to sinks within the code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except blocks to silently ignore ImportError exceptions could mask issues, but is common for optional dependencies; no suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import various optional modules and functions related to model explanation, visualization, and framework-specific explainers. The try-except blocks ensure the package remains operational if dependencies are missing, without exposing any network activity, system manipulation, or malicious behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, code injections, or unusual code structures. The absence of external network calls or data handling indicates no malicious intent. The code's structure is typical for a modular Python package supporting multiple optional dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard modular import setup for a Python explanation toolkit. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It properly handles optional dependencies, maintaining safe and predictable behavior.",
