  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- The code is a series of import statements with exception handling, designed to conditionally include optional dependencies.\n- No data processing, network activity, or external data handling is present.\n- Exception handling is standard for optional dependencies, with no suspicious patterns.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code structures are detected.\n- The code is typical for a Python package managing optional dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's role.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior, which aligns with the code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, just dependency management.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Note:** The security risk score is 0.1, which is low but indicates some minimal concern. Given the code's benign nature, this seems acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just optional dependencies.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Note:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) perhaps due to silent exception handling, but overall benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with a malware score of **0** across the board.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; scores are correct at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—conditional imports with exception handling—risk is minimal. The scores range from 0 to 0.2, which seems reasonable.\n\n**However,** the reports assign a slightly higher security risk (up to 0.2) due to silent exception handling. While this is common practice, it can mask underlying issues, but not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (low, acceptable for dependency management code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, well-structured, and safe. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate. No changes needed. The code poses no security threat, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
