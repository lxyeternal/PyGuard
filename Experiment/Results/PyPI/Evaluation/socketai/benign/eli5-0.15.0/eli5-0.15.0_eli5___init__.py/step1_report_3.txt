{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to import various modules and functions related to model explanation and visualization for different machine learning frameworks and libraries.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and functions from local package files and optional third-party libraries based on availability.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or security-sensitive actions detected. No network, file, or sensitive data access observed.",
  "flows": "Code flow involves conditional importing of optional modules based on library availability, with no data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The use of try-except blocks is typical for optional dependencies and does not suggest malicious intent. No obfuscation, unusual language features, or misleading variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code performs conditional imports of multiple optional dependencies, including IPython, pandas, Pillow, matplotlib, and various machine learning libraries like xgboost, lightgbm, catboost, keras, and openai. It gracefully handles ImportError and other specific exceptions, ensuring compatibility across environments with different libraries installed. There are no signs of malicious activities such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors. The structure and content indicate standard practice for managing optional dependencies in a Python package. No suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical dependency management module for a Python package related to model explanations. It performs safe conditional imports with error handling, and there are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
