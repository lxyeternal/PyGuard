{
  "purpose": "Provides explanation of feature importance via decision paths in ensemble models, aiding interpretability.",
  "sources": "Imports from eli5 library functions, processes model outputs, constructs explanation objects.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network, or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model predictions through explanation functions to explanation objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard interpretability utility for explaining feature contributions in tree-based models. It imports well-known libraries, defines descriptive strings, and constructs explanation objects based on model outputs. No network activity, file operations, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with common practices in model explanation tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for interpretability, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The high security risk scores in some reports are unjustified; they should be lowered to reflect the benign nature.",
