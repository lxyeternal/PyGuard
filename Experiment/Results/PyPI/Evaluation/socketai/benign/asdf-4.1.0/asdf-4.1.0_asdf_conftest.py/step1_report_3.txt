  "purpose": "Configure pytest testing framework with custom settings, handle warnings, and manage temporary working directory for test isolation.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd(), tmp_path_factory.mktemp(), pytest functions, and parser.addoption() reading command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "os.chdir() changing current working directory, which could affect environment state; pytest markers and options.",
  "flows": "Source os.getcwd() -> os.chdir() -> test environment setup; parser.addoption() -> pytest argument parsing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code mainly manages test setup and configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules os and pytest, then sets files to ignore during test collection. It modifies pytest collection to turn warnings into errors, which helps catch issues during testing. A fixture creates a temporary directory and changes the working directory for the test session, restoring the original afterwards, which is standard for test isolation. The parser adds a command-line option for a JSON schema test suite. All operations are typical for test configuration and do not involve any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely for configuring pytest test environment, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It manages test warnings, temporary directories, and command-line options securely. No security risks or malware are present.",
