  "purpose": "This code sets up configuration and fixtures for running tests with pytest, including ignoring certain files, modifying test item collection, creating a temporary working directory, and adding a command-line option.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd(), tmp_path_factory.mktemp(), parser.addoption()",
  "sinks": "os.chdir(), pytest markers and options",
  "flows": "Code reads current working directory, temporarily changes directory, modifies pytest test collection and adds command-line options",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. No use of environment variables in an insecure manner. No code injection or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard pytest configuration code. It manipulates test collection, creates a temporary directory for tests, and adds a CLI option. All operations are typical for test setup. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The use of os.chdir and pytest fixtures is routine and safe. No external network calls or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe and purely for test environment setup with no malicious intent or security risks.",
