  "purpose": "The code is a pytest configuration script for managing test collection, warning behavior, and a temporary working directory during testing.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd(), tmp_path_factory.mktemp(), pytest_addoption parser, pytest collection items, and fixtures.",
  "sinks": "Changing the working directory with os.chdir(), modifying test items with add_marker, and setting command-line options.",
  "flows": "The fixture _temp_cwd changes directory at the start of tests and restores it after; pytest_collection_modifyitems modifies warning behavior; pytest_addoption adds a command-line option.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; use of temporary directory for tests is standard; no data leaks or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pytest configuration script. It ignores specific files during test collection, converts warnings to errors, manages temporary working directories during tests, and adds a command-line option. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activities, or obfuscated/malicious code. The operations are typical for test setup and configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test configuration script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It manages test environment setup safely and effectively without any security concerns.",
