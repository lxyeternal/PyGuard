  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, schema-focused utility with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2). External schema loading is a known risk but not indicative of malicious behavior within the code itself."
