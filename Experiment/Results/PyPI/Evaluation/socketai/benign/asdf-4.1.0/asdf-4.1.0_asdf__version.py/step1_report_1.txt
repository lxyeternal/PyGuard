{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm, primarily for internal use and version tracking.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, reading no external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version data to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version information using static strings and tuples. It includes a conditional import that depends on TYPE_CHECKING, a common pattern in type hinting that does not execute at runtime. The version data is hardcoded and does not involve external input or sensitive information. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version definition snippet generated by setuptools_scm, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages internal version information with no external data handling.",
