  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a package, generated by setuptools_scm, used for managing versioning in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and version tuple, with the comment indicating automatic generation by setuptools_scm.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only assigns version data and does not handle untrusted input or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as this is static metadata assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded version numbers are standard for package versioning; no obfuscated or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables, with conditional typing support based on TYPE_CHECKING. It assigns fixed version strings and tuples, typical of auto-generated versioning files. There are no input handling, data leaks, or malicious constructs. The code's purpose is solely to store version metadata, and it does not perform any operations that could be malicious or insecure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard auto-generated versioning file with no malicious behavior or security issues. It merely stores static version information, which is typical in Python packages. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risk.",
