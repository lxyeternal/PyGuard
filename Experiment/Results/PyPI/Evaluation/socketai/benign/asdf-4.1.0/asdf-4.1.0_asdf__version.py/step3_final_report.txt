  "purpose": "The code provides static version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, with no dynamic or external data handling.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings and tuples, no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version info snippet with static strings and tuples, employing standard patterns for type hinting. It contains no external input, dynamic code, or malicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these assessments, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate and consistent, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
