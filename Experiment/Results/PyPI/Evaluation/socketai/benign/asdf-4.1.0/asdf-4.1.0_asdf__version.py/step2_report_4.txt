  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward, auto-generated version info snippet for a Python package, with no external input, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The code is standard boilerplate for version management.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   - The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the purpose, sources, sinks, flows, and anomalies.\n   - They correctly note the use of conditional type hinting (`TYPE_CHECKING`) and static assignment of version info.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are apparent in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, aligning with the absence of external data handling or vulnerabilities.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   - Since the code is purely static, auto-generated version info, with no external input, data leaks, or malicious logic, higher risk scores are unjustified.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this with zero scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   - The malware scores are 0 across all reports, which is accurate.  \n   - No malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   - The scores are consistent and reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment and Recommendations**:\n\n- **Overall Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe code is a standard, auto-generated version management snippet with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Summary**:  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates**:  \n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis above.",
