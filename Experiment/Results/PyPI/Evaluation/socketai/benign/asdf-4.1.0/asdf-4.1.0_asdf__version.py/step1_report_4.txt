  "purpose": "Defines versioning information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, reading no external input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward version assignment and type checking.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally defines a version tuple depending on TYPE_CHECKING, which is typical in type hinting scenarios. It assigns static version information ('4.1.0') and a version tuple. There are no external inputs, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate for version management with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious version declaration snippet. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
