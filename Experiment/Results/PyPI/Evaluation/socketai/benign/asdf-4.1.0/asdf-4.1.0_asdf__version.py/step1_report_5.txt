  "purpose": "This code sets up version information for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm, to manage and track package versioning.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements for __version__, version, __version_tuple__, and version_tuple",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points; no external data handling or network operations",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; simple variable assignments",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. The code is standard for versioning and generated by a well-known tool.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward version of a package version management file, typically auto-generated by setuptools_scm. It defines version-related variables, with conditional type checking. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code flows. The code is static and intended for version control only.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, auto-generated version management file with no malicious intent or security risks.",
