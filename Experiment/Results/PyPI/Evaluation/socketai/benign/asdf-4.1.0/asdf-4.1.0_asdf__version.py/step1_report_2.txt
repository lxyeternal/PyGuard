  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The version string and tuple variables are assigned directly from static literals.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version variables for a package, with conditional type hinting imports that do not execute at runtime. No external inputs, untrusted data, or malicious code execution paths are present. The code is straightforward and follows standard version assignment patterns. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version info snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
