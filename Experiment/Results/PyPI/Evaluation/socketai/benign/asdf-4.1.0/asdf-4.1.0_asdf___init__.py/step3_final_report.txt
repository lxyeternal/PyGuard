{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the __init__.py or module initializer for the 'asdf' Python library, exposing core classes, functions, and constants for public use.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports internal modules and defines __all__ for API exposure.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package initializer, importing internal components and defining the public API. It contains no data processing, network calls, or external interactions. All imported modules are trusted internal components. The structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and transparency confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe module initializer for the 'asdf' library, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks detected. All reports and scores are consistent with this assessment.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
