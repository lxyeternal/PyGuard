{
  "purpose": "Define custom warning and error classes for handling specific issues within the ASDF (Advanced Scientific Data Format) processing library.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes from 'yaml.representer' and 'asdf._jsonschema', which may include external dependencies.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily defines classes and does not contain code that executes data processing or external communication. No sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only declares classes and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. All classes are standard exception and warning subclasses with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules related to YAML representation errors and JSON schema validation errors, then defines multiple custom warning and exception classes related to ASDF data processing. These classes serve as structured indicators for various issues but do not contain executable logic or data manipulation. There are no hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns. The imports are from legitimate packages and are used solely for class inheritance and error handling. The overall structure is straightforward and typical for a library defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of class definitions for warnings and errors used within the ASDF library. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be well-structured and intended for internal use to signal specific conditions during data processing.",
