{
  "purpose": "Define custom warning and exception classes for the ASDF data handling library, facilitating structured error reporting and warnings.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'yaml.representer' and 'asdf._jsonschema' modules, used for validation and error handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data sinks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "The code does not process data or execute logic; it solely declares classes and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions inheriting from standard Python exceptions and warnings, with no dynamic code, external communication, or data processing. Imports are from legitimate packages. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code serves as part of an error/warning handling system within the ASDF library, and its benign nature is confirmed by the absence of executable logic or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard library module defining custom warnings and exceptions for the ASDF ecosystem. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. No adjustments are necessary; the code poses no security threat.",
