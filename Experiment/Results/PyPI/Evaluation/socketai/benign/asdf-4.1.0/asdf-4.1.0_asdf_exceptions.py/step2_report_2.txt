  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\nAll reports consistently conclude that the code is a straightforward, standard set of class definitions for custom warnings and exceptions related to the ASDF library. They note the absence of data processing, external communication, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The imports are from legitimate packages, and the classes serve as structured indicators for various issues during data handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of Issues:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code. The classes are purely definitional.\n- **Errors or Flaws:** No logical errors, mistakes, or security flaws are identified.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Risk Scores > 0.5:** None; all are zero, indicating no security concern.\n- **Malware Score:** Zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** No unwarranted assumptions are made; the analysis is cautious and accurate.\n- **Consistency of scores:** Scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Code Content:** Only class definitions, imports, and docstrings.\n- **Potential for Malicious Behavior:** None observed.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Supply Chain Risks:** None, as no external code execution or data handling occurs.\n- **External Dependencies:** Imports are from legitimate packages, used solely for class inheritance and error handling.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**These are appropriate given the code's nature.**\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code serves as part of a library's API for error and warning handling.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, or external communication.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The import statements are standard and do not introduce risks.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and safe for its intended purpose.",
