  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code solely defines custom warning and exception classes related to the ASDF package.\n- It imports standard modules (`yaml.representer`, `asdf._jsonschema`) for validation and error handling.\n- No data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution occurs.\n- All classes inherit from standard Python exceptions or warnings, with descriptive docstrings.\n- The code appears to be a typical library module for structured error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** The reports correctly identify that the code is purely class definitions and imports, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of anomalies or security issues.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated code, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n  Correct. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n  Correct. No obfuscation or hidden code.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very low (some reports use 0.0 or 0.1).  \n  Given the nature of the code, a **risk score of 0** is justified. It’s purely definitional, with no external dependencies or dynamic behaviors that could introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is safe, standard, and serves its purpose in error/warning handling within the ASDF ecosystem.\n- No adjustments needed for scores or conclusions.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n| Category          | Score |\n|-------------------|---------|\n| **Malware**       | 0       |\n| **Obfuscated**    | 0       |\n| **Risk**          | 0       |\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely declarative, defining classes for error handling, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors. The import statements are from legitimate packages, and there are no signs of security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action or concern is necessary.",
