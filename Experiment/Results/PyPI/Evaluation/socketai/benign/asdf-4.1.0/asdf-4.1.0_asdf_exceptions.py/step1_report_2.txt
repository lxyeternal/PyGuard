{
  "purpose": "Define custom warning and error classes related to the ASDF file format and its processing",
  "sources": "No external input sources; only class definitions and imports",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flows; class definitions do not process or propagate data",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; only class declarations",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements and class definitions for warnings and exceptions used in the ASDF ecosystem. There are no input/output operations, data handling, or suspicious behaviors. The classes inherit from standard Python exceptions and warnings, and the imported modules are well-known packages related to YAML and ASDF. There is no evidence of malicious code or sabotage, nor any obfuscated or malicious behavior. The code appears to serve as a part of a larger package's API for error handling and warnings.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely definitional, establishing custom warnings and errors for the ASDF package. There are no malicious behaviors, supply chain attacks, or security risks present. It appears safe and standard for its intended purpose.",
