{
  "purpose": "Define custom warning and error classes for the ASDF library, primarily used for data serialization, validation, and deprecation warnings.",
  "sources": "No direct input sources; the code imports external modules and defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code solely defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; straightforward class definitions with standard inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines several custom warning and error classes for the ASDF data format. The classes extend built-in exceptions and warnings, with descriptive docstrings. There are no indications of dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior. The classes serve as structured exception types for a larger system. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of class definitions for warnings and exceptions related to the ASDF library. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be well-structured, transparent, and safe.",
