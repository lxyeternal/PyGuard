{
  "purpose": "Define custom warning and error classes for the ASDF (Advanced Scientific Data Format) library to handle various deprecation, conversion, validation, and index issues.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules 'yaml.representer' and 'asdf._jsonschema', and the module's own class and constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "Class inheritance and exception raising are primarily for structured error handling; no untrusted data handling or external system effects are present.",
  "flows": "Imports and class definitions, with no dynamic data flow or untrusted data processing; no external or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward class and exception definitions for an SDK or library. It imports necessary modules, defines custom warning and error classes with appropriate inheritance, and provides docstrings explaining their purpose. There are no signs of malicious code, code injection, or external system access. The code appears to be a standard part of a Python library for data handling, with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal, benign module that defines custom warning and exception classes for the ASDF library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks. It is safe and intended for structured error management within the library.",
