{
  "purpose": "Provides resource management and mapping functionalities for plugins, schemas, and package resources.",
  "sources": "User-supplied 'delegate' objects, package resource data via pkgutil.get_data, environment variables are not directly used, no user input handling.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; data retrieval from package resources is read-only and controlled.",
  "flows": "No external untrusted input flows into sensitive sinks; resource access is controlled via known package data or internal mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; code appears to implement standard resource mapping without obfuscated or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for resource mapping and management, relying on standard library functions and clear, explicit logic. No evidence of malicious code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The resource access methods use package data and simple mappings. No use of eval, exec, or other dynamic code execution is detected. The class methods and properties are standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate resource management code with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard resource management implementation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily manages access to package resources and schemas without any suspicious activities.",
