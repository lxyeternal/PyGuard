{
  "purpose": "Provides resource management classes and mappings for accessing schemas and resources, mainly for plugin support.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from package resources via pkgutil.get_data, and class name via get_class_name; data is fetched from class attributes and method calls.",
  "sinks": "Data is returned directly from resource mappings without untrusted input processing; no evident sink for user input or external untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "The code flows from resource request (via __getitem__) to returning resource data from package resources, with no evident data manipulation or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious imports are present. The code appears to be standard resource handling logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements resource mappings with standard package resource access via pkgutil, and wraps mappings with proxies that include package metadata. It manages multiple mappings and provides a clean interface. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration are observed. The usage of get_class_name and package resource access is typical and safe. There are no anomalies or suspicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of resource management classes with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be well-structured, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal.",
