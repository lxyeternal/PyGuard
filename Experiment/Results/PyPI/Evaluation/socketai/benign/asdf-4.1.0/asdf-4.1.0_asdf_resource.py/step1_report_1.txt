{
  "purpose": "Provide resource management and access to schemas and resources via mappings and proxies.",
  "sources": "Data accessed via pkgutil.get_data, and mappings provided as input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data returned by __getitem__ methods, especially from pkgutil.get_data.",
  "flows": "Resource request (uri) → __getitem__ method → pkgutil.get_data call → data return.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pkgutil.get_data to load data from package resources; no external input handling or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines resource mapping classes that wrap data sources, including package resource retrieval via pkgutil.get_data. The ResourceManager manages multiple mappings, resolving URIs. The JsonschemaResourceMapping fetches schemas based on a fixed URI-to-filename mapping. All data accesses are based on known package resources; no user input, environment variables, or network operations that could be exploited were found. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears standard for resource management without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of resource mappings with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not contain backdoors, data leaks, or external network operations. All data access methods rely on package resources, and no dynamic or unsafe code execution is present.",
