  "purpose": "Provides resource mapping classes for handling resource files, including proxies, resource managers, and JSON schema fetchers.",
  "sources": "Imports 'pkgutil' and 'get_class_name' from util; reads resource data via 'pkgutil.get_data' and class name via 'get_class_name'.",
  "sinks": "Returns data from 'pkgutil.get_data' and '__getitem__' methods; no untrusted input is directly written or executed.",
  "flows": "ResourceManager retrieves resource content via '__getitem__'; JsonschemaResourceMapping retrieves schema files; ResourceMappingProxy wraps mappings for metadata access.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or unusual code constructs detected. No network connections or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines resource handling classes with standard patterns: proxies, resource managers, and schema fetchers. Resource data is fetched using 'pkgutil.get_data', which is safe assuming no malicious package tampering. No user input is processed or executed, and no suspicious code constructs are present. The code adheres to typical design and does not include malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The overall security profile appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard resource handling implementation with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It relies on standard Python library functions for resource access and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
