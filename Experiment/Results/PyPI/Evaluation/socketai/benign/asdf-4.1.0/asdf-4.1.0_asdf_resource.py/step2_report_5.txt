  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code uses `pkgutil.get_data` to load resources from package data, with no external input or dynamic code execution. No suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — justified, as no vulnerabilities or malicious activity are identified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high certainty.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code manages resources via static mappings and package data. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — slightly above zero, possibly reflecting minimal inherent risk in resource management but no actual vulnerabilities.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The slightly elevated security risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given the nature of resource access, but no actual vulnerabilities are present. The malware score remains zero.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Standard resource management with no suspicious activity, no dynamic code execution, no external inputs.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, reflecting the low likelihood of issues.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, resource access via `pkgutil.get_data`, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — consistent with minimal inherent risk.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The evaluation appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Resource management via package data, no external inputs, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score 0). The code only accesses static package resources.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, as the code is straightforward and well-structured.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0, 0.1, 0.2) reflect the minimal inherent risk in resource management, which is justified given the static nature of resource access.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected or implied.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, primarily due to reliance on package resources, which inherently carry minimal risk if package integrity is maintained.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. No further action or concern is warranted based on the provided code and analysis.",
