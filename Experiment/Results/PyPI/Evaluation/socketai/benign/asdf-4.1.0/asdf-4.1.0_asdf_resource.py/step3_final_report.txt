  "purpose": "Provides resource mappings and access to package resources such as schemas and metaschemas.",
  "sources": "pkgutil.get_data calls fetching data from package resources; class attributes and static mappings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input, external network activity, or dynamic code execution present; no data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "Resource access via static package data; no external data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward resource management with no obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code manages resources through static package data, using pkgutil.get_data, with no dynamic inputs or external communications. It includes proxy classes adding metadata and a resource manager combining multiple mappings. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The resource access relies on package integrity, which is standard and safe. Overall, the code is a typical resource management pattern with minimal security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. The security scores are appropriate and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
