      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard library module defining custom warnings and exceptions for the ASDF ecosystem. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. No adjustments are necessary; the code poses no security threat."

No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of external extension code, which is outside the scope of this code snippet. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."

      "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, extension-friendly YAML serialization/deserialization module supporting custom data types and tags. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main concern is handling untrusted YAML input, which is inherent to such libraries but is mitigated by safe loaders and constructors. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting standard risks associated with deserializing untrusted data."

      "conclusion": "This is a typical plugin loader with appropriate error handling, no malicious or obfuscated elements. The main security risk stems from executing untrusted plugin code, not from the code itself. Scores reflect this: malware likelihood is low (0.6), obfuscation absent (0), and inherent risk moderate (0.55)."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified, with malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2). External schema loading is a known risk but not indicative of malicious behavior within the code itself."
