{
  "purpose": "Provides compression and decompression utilities for handling data streams with various compression algorithms, including extension support.",
  "sources": "Data is read from file-like objects via fd.read_blocks() and input data buffers provided to compress/decompress functions.",
  "sinks": "Decompressed data written into numpy arrays; compressed data written to file-like objects; possible internal data transformations.",
  "flows": "Input data → compression functions → file writes or numpy buffers; compressed data read from file → decompression functions → numpy buffers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports within class initializers; no hardcoded credentials or sensitive data; no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard compression/decompression logic using well-known libraries (zlib, bz2, lz4). It includes extension mechanisms for additional compressors. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behavior evident. Functions handle data streams securely, with proper error handling. No backdoors, remote communications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No suspicious anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of data compression utilities with support for extension-based compressors. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are identified. It mainly handles data processing tasks securely and transparently.",
