{
  "purpose": "The code provides compression and decompression utilities for handling various compression formats (zlib, bz2, lz4) in the context of ASDF files, including extension support and validation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, extension labels from get_config().extensions, and files via fd.read_blocks.",
  "sinks": "Writes compressed data to file objects (fd.write), and decompresses data into numpy arrays; potential data leakage if misused, but no direct security sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated and selected for compression; compressed data flows from compressor methods to file write; decompression reads from file and outputs numpy arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or malicious runtime behavior detected; extension handling is standard. No suspicious network activity or code injection found.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs data compression and decompression with support for multiple algorithms. It includes validation of compression types, extension-based plugin architecture, and safe handling of data buffers. No signs of malicious code, such as network transmission, system commands, or backdoors, are evident. Use of warnings and error handling appears standard. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The extension mechanism is benign, focused on modularity. Overall, the code performs legitimate compression functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a standard implementation of compression utilities with extension support. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and purposeful, with no evidence of sabotage or privacy violations.",
