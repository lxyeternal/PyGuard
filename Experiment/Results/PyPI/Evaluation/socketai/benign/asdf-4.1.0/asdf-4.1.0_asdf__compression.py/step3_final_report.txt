  "purpose": "Provides compression and decompression utilities supporting multiple algorithms and extension mechanisms for Python data processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data buffers, extension labels, and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Outputs compressed/decompressed data blocks, extension labels, and validation warnings.",
  "flows": "Input data -> validation -> compressor selection -> compression/decompression -> output buffers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; extension support could be exploited if malicious extensions are loaded, but the core code is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard compression/decompression routines with extension support, proper validation, and error handling. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. Extension mechanisms are external and not controlled by this code, posing minimal inherent risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are detected. The extension support introduces a potential attack surface but is a common pattern in plugin-based systems. Overall, the code is safe, transparent, and purpose-driven.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of compression utilities with extension support. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The slight risk score accounts for extension mechanisms but does not reflect actual malicious behavior.",
