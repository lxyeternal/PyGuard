  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a standard compression/decompression utility with extension support. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. Confidence 0.95, malware 0.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The code performs legitimate functions.\n  - No signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n  - Extension mechanism is benign.\n\n- **Score Justification**:\n  - Malware score: 0 is appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 correct.\n  - Risk score: 0.1 is reasonable given the extension support, but no actual malicious extension is present.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, confirming standard compression functions with extension support. No malicious activity detected. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - No suspicious code or behavior.\n  - Proper validation and safe data handling.\n  - Extension support is standard.\n\n- **Score Justification**:\n  - Malware: 0 is correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 correct.\n  - Risk: 0.2, considering extension support, but no actual threat.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Same as above, standard compression/decompression with extension support, no malicious activity. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - No malicious code or network activity.\n  - Use of dynamic import is safe here.\n  - Data handling appears secure.\n\n- **Score Justification**:\n  - Malware: 0 correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 correct.\n  - Risk: 0.2 is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Again, standard implementation with extension support, no malicious behavior. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - No suspicious patterns.\n  - Proper validation and error handling.\n  - No obfuscation or malicious code.\n\n- **Score Justification**:\n  - Malware: 0 appropriate.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 appropriate.\n  - Risk: 0.1, reflecting the extension mechanism but no actual threat.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar assessment; no malicious activity, extension-based design, standard patterns. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - No malicious code.\n  - Extension system could be a vector if extensions are malicious, but the code itself is safe.\n  - No obfuscation.\n\n- **Score Justification**:\n  - Malware: 0 correct.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 correct.\n  - Risk: 0.2, considering potential extension risks but no actual malicious extension.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware scores**: All zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores**: All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores**: Slightly varied between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting the extension support, but no actual malicious extensions or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the code's purpose, structure, and the reports' analyses, **the scores are appropriate and consistent**. The extension mechanism, while potentially exploitable if malicious extensions are introduced, is a known and controlled pattern. No actual malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 – 0.2 (due to extension support, but no actual threat)\n\nThe code appears safe, well-structured, and purpose-driven, with no evidence of sabotage or malicious intent.",
