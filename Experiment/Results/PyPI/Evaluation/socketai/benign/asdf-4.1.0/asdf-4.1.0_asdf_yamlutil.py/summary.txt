  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, extension-friendly YAML serialization/deserialization module supporting custom data types and tags. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main concern is handling untrusted YAML input, which is inherent to such libraries but is mitigated by safe loaders and constructors. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting standard risks associated with deserializing untrusted data."
