{
  "purpose": "A collection of utility functions for iterable manipulation, class hierarchy traversal, and list-like operations, intended for internal data processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as iterables, dictionaries, class types, indices, and configuration flags; data is read from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed internally; no external sinks like network, file, or environment modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through functions, often via iterators, with validation and transformations; no external data transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected; code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for sorting indices, generating combinations, class introspection, padding, slicing, inserting, replacing, and removing elements from iterables. It relies on standard Python libraries and a third-party library 'iteration_utilities'. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external side-effects are present. Input validation is appropriate, and the functions perform deterministic data manipulations. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, utility-focused module with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured, transparent, and safe for supply chain inclusion. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis.",
