{
  "purpose": "This module provides chainable, utility-based iterable classes and functions for advanced iteration patterns in Python, including infinite iterables and multi-iterable operations.",
  "sources": "Data is read from passed iterable objects, external functions (like func, key, pred), and standard library functions such as itertools and statistics. No external or untrusted input sources are directly invoked within this code.",
  "sinks": "Data could flow into functions such as getitem, get_all, get_argmax, get_sum, etc., but these are standard safe functions. There are no indications of insecure data handling, external network calls, or system command executions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input iterables or functions (sources) into various processing methods (sinks) via chainable method calls, but all are standard iteration and processing operations with no suspicious side effects.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs extensive use of standard Python iteration patterns and utilities. There are no hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behavior is present. It mostly consists of method wrappers around existing safe functions.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review reveals that this code implements a structured, chainable iterable utility class with methods wrapping standard Python and itertools functions. It manages both finite and infinite iterables, providing many safe, well-understood iteration utilities. No code indicates malicious behavior such as network access, system modification, or data exfiltration. No anomalies like obfuscated code or hidden logic are detected. All functions perform typical iteration and data processing operations without side effects. Usage of external functions and internal calls are safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, utility-focused iterable class designed for chaining safe iteration operations. It does not contain any malicious or sabotage code. The implementation leverages existing Python standard library functions responsibly without introducing security risks.",
