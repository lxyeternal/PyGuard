  "purpose": "Defines constant functions and iterable element selectors using 'iteration_utilities' for utility purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'iteration_utilities' and the assignment of constants and selectors.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or external data flows; purely utility functions.",
  "flows": "Constants and selectors are assigned directly without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports well-known utility functions to create constant value functions and nth-element selectors. It does not process input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify the low risk assessment. No logical errors or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
