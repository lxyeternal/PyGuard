{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for returning constant values and selecting nth elements from iterables.",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'iteration_utilities' library: 'constant' and 'nth'. No other data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or produce output.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines functions but does not perform data flow operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'iteration_utilities' functions to create constant value functions and nth element selectors. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports utility functions to create constant value functions ('return_True', 'return_False', 'return_None') and nth element selectors ('first', 'second', 'third', 'last'). These are simple, well-understood utility functions with no apparent malicious behavior. No input/output operations, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module providing simple, reusable functions for constant values and iterable element selection. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
