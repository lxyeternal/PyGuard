  "purpose": "Define utility functions for returning constant values and selecting elements from iterables",
  "sources": "Imports from the 'iteration_utilities' library",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations present",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'constant' and 'nth' functions from an external library; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from the 'iteration_utilities' package and creates several constants for common operations: returning fixed values (True, False, None) and selecting items at specific positions in an iterable. These are straightforward utility functions, commonly used in codebases. There are no data flows from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behaviors such as network access, file manipulation, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a benign utility module intended for simplifying iterable operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple utility module that defines constant-returning functions and element selectors from a third-party library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and straightforward.",
