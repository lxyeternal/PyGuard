{
  "purpose": "The code defines environment checks for Python implementations and versions, and creates a sentinel object for default values.",
  "sources": "Reads system and platform information via sys.version_info and platform.python_implementation(), and initializes a sentinel object.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not process untrusted input or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; the sentinel class is straightforward and only used for internal purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment detection (CPython, PyPy, Python 3.8+, Python 3.12) and defines a sentinel factory object. It does not process external data, does not include any network, file, or environment variable access, and contains no dynamic execution or obfuscated logic. The sentinel class is a simple object with no malicious intent. All modules used are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment detection utility and sentinel implementation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
