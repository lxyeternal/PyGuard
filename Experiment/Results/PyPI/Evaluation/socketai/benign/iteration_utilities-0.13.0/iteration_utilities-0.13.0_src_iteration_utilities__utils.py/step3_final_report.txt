  "purpose": "The code detects the Python environment (implementation and version) and creates a sentinel object for internal use, likely for compatibility or configuration checks.",
  "sources": "Standard library calls: platform.python_implementation(), sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward environment detection and sentinel creation with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules to determine environment details and defines boolean flags accordingly. It creates a simple sentinel object via a minimal class. There are no external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The logic is clear, and the purpose appears to be internal configuration or compatibility checks. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment detection utility with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports are accurate, thorough, and correctly score the code as safe. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
