{
  "purpose": "The code defines environment-specific constants and a sentinel factory class for internal use, likely for configuration or version detection purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads system information via platform.python_implementation() and sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Uses system information as input to determine environment properties; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The class is a simple data container.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines constants based on system environment details, and creates a sentinel class for internal use. No untrusted input handling, no network operations, and no code that manipulates external data. The sentinel class only stores and represents a name string. The logic is straightforward and typical for environment detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for environment detection and internal sentinel creation. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
