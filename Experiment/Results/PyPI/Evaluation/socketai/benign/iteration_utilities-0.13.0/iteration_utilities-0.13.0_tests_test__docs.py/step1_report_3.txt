  "purpose": "The code is a test script designed to run doctests on various modules and components within the iteration_utilities package and some helper functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for doctest, pytest, iteration_utilities, _iteration_utilities, and helper_funcs; usage of these modules to run tests.",
  "sinks": "Execution of doctest.testmod for each module; no data sinks or external network communication; no untrusted data handling visible.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are used to run tests; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The code is straightforward testing code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports testing libraries and the target modules, then conditionally runs doctests on various parts of the iteration_utilities package. The use of pytest.mark.parametrize indicates multiple modules are tested. The code appears to be a typical test setup without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No external data, network activity, or secret handling is present. The only potential concern is the import of internal modules (_iteration_utilities) which could be sensitive if it contained malicious code, but as this is a standard testing pattern, it’s not inherently suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard testing script designed to verify the correctness of modules within the iteration_utilities package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be benign testing code.",
