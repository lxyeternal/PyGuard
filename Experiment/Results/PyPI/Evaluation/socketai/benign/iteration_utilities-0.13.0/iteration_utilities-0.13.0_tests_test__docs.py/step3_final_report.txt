{
  "purpose": "The code runs doctests on various modules of the iteration_utilities package to verify documentation correctness.",
  "sources": "Imports from iteration_utilities modules and helper_funcs, and the doctest.testmod() calls within the test_doctests function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code executes only internal module tests without external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "The test function calls doctest.testmod() on each module, verifying embedded documentation examples; no external data flows are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, importing internal modules and running standard tests.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard testing harness utilizing pytest and doctest to verify documentation examples in various internal modules of iteration_utilities. It imports internal modules (prefixed with underscores), which is typical for internal testing. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution outside the controlled testing environment. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The use of skip_if_not_latest_python indicates environment-aware testing, not malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing script for verifying documentation correctness. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
