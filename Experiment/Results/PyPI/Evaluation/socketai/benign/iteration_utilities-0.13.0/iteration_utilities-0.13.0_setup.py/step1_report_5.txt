{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for building a Python extension module using C source files, specifically for the 'iteration_utilities' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from static file lists specified in the 'files' array, and constructs source paths based on these filenames within the 'src/iteration_utilities/_iteration_utilities/' directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks such as network connections, system calls, or sensitive data handling that could lead to leaks or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "The script flows from defining source filenames, constructing their paths, and passing these to the Extension build process without involving external input or network data.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The code is a straightforward setup configuration for compiling C extensions.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a list of C source files, constructs their full paths relative to the project directory, and configures the build of a Python extension module. It uses standard practices with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations. All code appears to be for legitimate extension compilation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for building a C extension module in Python. It contains no malicious code, no external data sources, and no suspicious behavior. It is safe and typical for package compilation.",
