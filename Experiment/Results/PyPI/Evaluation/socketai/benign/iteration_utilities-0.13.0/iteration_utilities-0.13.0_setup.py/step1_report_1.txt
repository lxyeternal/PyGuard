{
  "purpose": "To define and build a Python C extension module named 'iteration_utilities._iteration_utilities' using a collection of C source files.",
  "sources": "Static list of C source files included in the 'files' list, used in the setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks involving untrusted data or sensitive operations are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code only specifies static file paths for compilation.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward setup configuration for building a C extension. No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for setup and path handling, defines a list of C source files, and sets up a compilation configuration for a Python extension module. The source files are located in a nested 'src/iteration_utilities/_iteration_utilities/' directory, and the setup uses setuptools to compile these into a binary extension. There are no dynamic evaluations, user inputs, or suspicious behaviors present. The code follows standard packaging practices for Python C extensions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for compiling a C extension module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
