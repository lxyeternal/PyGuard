{
  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python C extension module for the 'iteration_utilities' package using specified C source files.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only static file references and environment variables (import sys, os.path).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network operations, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only constructs a setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a list of C source files. It constructs the paths to these source files within a 'src/iteration_utilities/_iteration_utilities' directory. The setup() function configures a C extension module with these sources. There are no data inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution; the code strictly performs build configuration for a C extension module. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for compiling a Python C extension module. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code patterns, and no security risks. It solely defines build instructions for a performance-related extension.",
