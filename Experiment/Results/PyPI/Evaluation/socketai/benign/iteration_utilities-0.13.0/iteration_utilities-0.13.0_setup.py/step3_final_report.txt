{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script using setuptools to compile a Python C extension module from a list of C source files located in a specific directory.",
  "sources": "Static list of C source files, paths constructed with os.path.join from the 'src/iteration_utilities/_iteration_utilities/' directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or input sinks; the script only defines build configuration without runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A — static build configuration, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no dynamic code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a list of C source files, constructs their full paths assuming a fixed directory structure, and configures setuptools to build a C extension module. There is no dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or obfuscated code. The purpose is purely to compile C sources into a Python extension, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for building a Python C extension module. All reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate low risk scores. There are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
