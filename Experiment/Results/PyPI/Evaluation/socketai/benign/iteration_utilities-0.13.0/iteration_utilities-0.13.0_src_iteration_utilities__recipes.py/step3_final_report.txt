  "purpose": "A collection of utility functions for iterable manipulation, including tail, consume, ncycles, flatten, repeatfunc, ipartition, nth_combination, powerset, random_product, random_permutation, random_combination, and tee_lookahead.",
  "sources": "Input data from user-defined iterables, generators, and functions; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "In-memory data processing; no external data leaks, network activity, or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Data flows within functions through standard library calls; no external communication or side-effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code relies solely on standard Python modules (collections, itertools, random). Functions perform typical iterable operations, such as tailing, consuming, generating combinations, permutations, and sampling. Randomness is used for sampling functions with seed control, which is standard practice. No external system calls, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, utility-focused set of functions for iterable operations with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal. The existing reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
