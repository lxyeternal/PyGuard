  "purpose": "To facilitate the packaging and distribution of a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows, source-to-sink paths, or data processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard for a setup script; no unusual code constructs, secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls the 'setup()' function with default parameters. This is a common pattern in Python package setup scripts. No input handling, data processing, or external data manipulation occurs. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The script does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or other potentially harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves the purpose of packaging a Python project but contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
