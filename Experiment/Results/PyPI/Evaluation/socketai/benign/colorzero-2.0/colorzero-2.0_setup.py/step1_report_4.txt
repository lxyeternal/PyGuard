  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function call, which may read configuration data from setup.py or related files.",

  "flows": "Input data (configuration parameters) from setup.py or associated files flows into the 'setup()' function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and standard for package setup.",
