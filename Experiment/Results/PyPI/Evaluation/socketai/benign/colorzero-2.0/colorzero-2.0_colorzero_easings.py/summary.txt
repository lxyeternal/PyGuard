  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and benign, with a minor bug in handling edge cases (steps=1). No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The empty reports do not suggest any security issues. The overall security risk is very low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a slight risk score of 0.2 due to the division by zero potential."
