  "purpose": "Provides various easing functions for color gradient transitions.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'steps' for each function; internal calculations within each function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions generate sequences without external data interaction.",
  "flows": "Input 'steps' flows into the functions; generated values flow out as sequences for gradient calculations.",
  "anomalies": "Potential division by zero in 'linear' when steps=1; 'ease_in_out' formula may produce unexpected values outside [0,1].",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard easing functions with correct logic, except for a missing edge case handling in 'linear' for steps=1, which could cause division by zero. The 'ease_in_out' function's formula should be verified against standard easing equations for correctness. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The reports are empty, providing no additional evidence or concerns. Overall, the code is benign but contains a minor bug affecting robustness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and benign, with a minor bug in handling edge cases (steps=1). No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The empty reports do not suggest any security issues. The overall security risk is very low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a slight risk score of 0.2 due to the division by zero potential.",
