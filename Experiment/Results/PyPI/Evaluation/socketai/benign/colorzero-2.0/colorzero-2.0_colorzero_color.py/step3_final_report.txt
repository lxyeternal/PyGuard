{
  "purpose": "The code defines a comprehensive Color class for representing and manipulating colors across various color spaces, with multiple constructors, operators, and formatting options.",
  "sources": "Input data from strings, numeric arguments, bytes, tuples, and keyword arguments used to instantiate or modify color objects.",
  "sinks": "Output through string representations (__str__, __repr__), properties (html, rgb, yuv, etc.), and formatting functions; no external system calls or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into constructors and methods, converting to internal float RGB representation, then to formatted strings or other color spaces for output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Regex is used solely for string formatting, not code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard color manipulation library supporting multiple color spaces and conversions. It includes operator overloads for color arithmetic and formatting options for display. No external data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The regex used is for string matching only, not execution. The constructor's flexibility is typical for such libraries and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe color library with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It performs internal computations and formatting without external system interactions. The overall security risk is minimal.",
