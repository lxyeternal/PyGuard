{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Color class for color manipulation and conversions in various color spaces, supporting construction, arithmetic operations, and formatting for display.",
  "sources": "Reads input data primarily from method parameters, such as color specifications (strings, numbers, tuples), environment variables not used, and constants. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include string formatting for HTML and terminal display, and color conversions. No data is sent over the network, written to files, or used in system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data (color specs, numerical values) are processed through class methods to produce color objects, then possibly formatted or converted, with no external data exfiltration or system commands executed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of regex for format handling appears standard. No obfuscated code or hidden logic is present. The code performs expected color manipulation tasks without hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a Color class with multiple constructors for different color spaces, supports arithmetic operations on colors and attributes, and provides various formatting and conversion methods. All methods appear to process data locally without external interactions. No network activity, system calls, or data leaks are observed. The code relies on external modules for conversions, which is typical for such libraries. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware functions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard color manipulation library with no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It performs expected operations for color processing and formatting without external data exfiltration or harmful actions.",
