  "purpose": "Define various color system representations using named tuples for color manipulation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from collections and .attr module, class constructors, property methods, and string representations.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code primarily defines immutable data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Code is standard for color data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several color system data structures using named tuples and classes, with properties for accessing individual color components. No input handling, network activity, or external data processing present. The structure appears conventional and intended solely for data representation. No suspicious or malicious patterns are observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code features are evident. The code is well-structured, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of color data structures with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data, perform external operations, or include suspicious code segments.",
