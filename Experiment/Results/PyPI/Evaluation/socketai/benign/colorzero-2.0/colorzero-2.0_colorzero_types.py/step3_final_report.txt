  "purpose": "Define data structures for various color models using named tuples and classes, facilitating color representation and manipulation.",
  "sources": "No external input, data is hardcoded in class constructors and property methods.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows within the class methods and property accessors, but no external data flow or untrusted input handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard Python idioms, no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple color models (RGB, HLS, HSV, YUV, CMY, CMYK, YIQ, XYZ, Luv, Lab) using named tuples and classes with properties for component access. All methods are standard, with no external input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward, serving as a data model for color representations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal security risk score in some reports (0.1) is an overestimation; given the static, data-only nature, the risk score should be 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of data models for color systems with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, aligning with the analysis.",
