  "purpose": "Define various color system data structures and representations using namedtuples and classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements (collections, .attr), class constructors (__new__), property methods, __repr__ methods, and _replace methods.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no data output or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor inputs to properties and methods that create new instances or representations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of _replace methods and property getters appears standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines color representations via classes and namedtuples. It employs standard Python patterns for immutable data structures, including __new__, _replace, __repr__, and property methods. No external data input, network operations, or suspicious file manipulations are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate library for color data management with no malicious intent. It uses import statements and class definitions that are common in Python libraries. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard implementation of color data structures. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. It appears to be a straightforward library for color representation without security risks.",
