  "purpose": "Define various color system representations using named tuples and properties for color manipulation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for collections and attributes, class constructors (__new__), property methods, and string representations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; code mainly creates data structures and properties, no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor arguments into named tuple instances, accessed via properties, with no external data sources or sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. Code uses standard Python features for data structure definitions. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines data structures for various color models using named tuples, with properties for convenient access to individual components. It uses standard library modules and simple class inheritance for customization. No external data sources, network calls, or security-sensitive operations are present. The implementation appears straightforward and standard for a color library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of color data structures without malicious intent or security risks. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no obfuscated or malware-like code. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
