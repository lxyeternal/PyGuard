  "purpose": "Define various color system representations using named tuples and classes for color manipulation.",
  "sources": "Imports from collections, local attr module, and class constructors for color tuples.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data sinks or external data transmissions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters into tuple objects, with properties providing access to color components. No external data or untrusted input sources detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures. Use of property decorators and custom _replace methods are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple color models as named tuples and classes, with methods for replacement, representation, and property access. No code injection, dynamic execution, or malicious data handling detected. The code appears well-structured and solely focused on data representation for colors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of color data structures with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to serve its purpose for color representation cleanly.",
