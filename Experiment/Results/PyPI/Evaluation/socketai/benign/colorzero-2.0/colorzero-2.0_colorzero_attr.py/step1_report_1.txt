{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for manipulating color attributes such as red, green, blue, hue, lightness, saturation, and luma for use in color transformations.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; all data is handled via class instantiation and property calculations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; code primarily performs arithmetic operations and representations.",
  "flows": "Class instantiations and property access for color components with arithmetic operations supporting transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No network activity, file manipulations, or obfuscated code present. Usage of mathematical operations and class properties is standard for color manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several classes representing color components with methods supporting arithmetic operations and representations. All operations involve float values and standard mathematical calculations, with no user input handling, external data reading, or network activity. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors are evident. The code appears to be a standard, well-documented color library module. There are no anomalies suggesting malicious intent, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward color manipulation library with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily provides mathematical representations for color components used in graphical transformations, with no external data handling or potentially harmful operations.",
