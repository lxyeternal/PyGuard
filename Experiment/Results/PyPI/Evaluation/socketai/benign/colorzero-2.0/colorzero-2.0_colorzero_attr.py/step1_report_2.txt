{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for manipulating color attributes via standard binary operators, such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication, for use in a color manipulation library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from class instantiations and property accesses, especially when creating color component objects (Red, Green, Blue, Hue, Lightness, Saturation, Luma). No external input sources are evident within this fragment.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs string representations via __repr__, which do not pose security risks. No data leaks, network connections, or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation flows from input values (float, deg, rad) into objects like Red, Green, Blue, Hue, etc., with property accessors converting internal representations. No untrusted data flows to external sinks or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code mainly defines simple classes with mathematical operations and string representations, with no suspicious behaviors or side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for color components, with methods supporting construction, representation, and property-based conversions (e.g., degrees, radians). There are no external input sources, network calls, file operations, or system modifications. No obfuscation techniques or suspicious constructs are present. The mathematical operations and class design are standard for a color manipulation library. Overall, the code appears benign and focused on color data modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward color attribute manipulation library with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It only provides data structures and operations for color components without external interactions or side effects.",
