{
  "purpose": "Defines color schemes and mappings for CSS, DOS, and XTerm colors, along with named color hex codes.",
  "sources": "Data is hardcoded within dictionaries and function parameters; no external input or data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external outputs that could leak data or execute code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily creates static mappings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The function _transpose is straightforward and used only for data transformation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines color data and a utility function for transposing dictionaries. It does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or execute dynamic code. The data is static, and the structure is simple. No obfuscation, malicious logic, or external data handling is present. The code appears to be a standard color library definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign color mapping library with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions as a static resource for color definitions.",
