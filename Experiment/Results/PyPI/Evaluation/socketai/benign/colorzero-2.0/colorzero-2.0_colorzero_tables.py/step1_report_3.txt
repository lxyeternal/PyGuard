{
  "purpose": "Defines color constants, mappings, and utilities for color conversions and color name lookups.",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data reads; static data structures including color tables and dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no data leaks, network operations, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly processes static data for color representations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The only processing involves dictionary manipulations and static mappings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation defining color mappings for DOS, XTerm, and named CSS colors. It includes a helper function _transpose to invert dictionaries while handling duplicates. All data structures are static, and there are no input/output operations or system calls. No code injection, malicious behavior, or malicious side-effects are present. The code is well-structured and intended for color handling in a library, with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static color mapping library with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It only provides color data and a simple utility function, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
