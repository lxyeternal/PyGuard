{
  "purpose": "The code defines color mappings, including CSS named colors, DOS colors, and XTerm colors, for use in color-related functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data structures for color definitions, including dictionaries and tuples. No user input or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flow points involving untrusted data or external outputs that could be exploited for data leakage or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The code primarily initializes static dictionaries and a helper function to transpose tables. No dynamic data flow or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code, is detected. The code is straightforward data definitions and a simple utility function.",
  "analysis": "The script provides color mappings using static dictionaries and a utility function to invert key-value pairs in a dictionary. No external data sources, network communications, or dynamic execution are present. The code includes standard color data consistent with CSS, DOS, and XTerm standards, with no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The implementation is clean, well-structured, and does not involve any risky or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely static data definitions and a basic helper function for data manipulation. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a safe, utility-oriented module for color mappings.",
