{
  "purpose": "Defines color names and color tables for CSS, DOS, and XTerm colors, including mappings for named colors and their hex codes.",
  "sources": "The code reads color data from hardcoded dictionaries and a function _transpose; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations; the code mainly establishes static color mappings.",
  "flows": "The code transforms color tables via _transpose, but there are no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code is straightforward and solely defines static data.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static data definitions, including color mappings, with a helper function _transpose for table transformation. There are no dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling. The code does not contain obfuscation, malicious functions, or external dependencies that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, static collection of color definitions and transformations. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is present. It appears safe and intended for use as a color reference library.",
