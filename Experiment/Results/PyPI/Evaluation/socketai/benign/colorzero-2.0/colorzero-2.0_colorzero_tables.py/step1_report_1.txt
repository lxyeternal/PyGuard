{
  "purpose": "Provides color name definitions, including CSS, DOS, and XTerm colors, as well as named color hex codes.",
  "sources": "Color data tables (_transpose, DOS_COLORS, XTERM_COLORS, NAMED_COLORS), and the input color name dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted input or could leak data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines static data structures and functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The _transpose function is straightforward and harmless. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static color tables and mappings, with a simple helper function to transpose dictionaries. The data is hardcoded and sourced from known color standards. No external inputs, network activity, or potentially malicious behavior present. The code appears to be purely for color data definitions, with no malicious or security-related operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, only containing color data definitions and simple utility functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
