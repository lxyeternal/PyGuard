  "purpose": "Static color data definitions and a simple utility function for inverting color tables.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded color tables, including DOS_COLORS, XTERM_COLORS, and NAMED_COLORS dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "The code defines static data; no data flows from sources to sinks as there are no dynamic inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and well-structured with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static color mappings and a utility function to invert dictionaries. There are no external inputs, network communications, or dynamic code execution. The data is sourced from known color standards, and the helper function handles dictionary inversion with duplicate value handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the security risk score is minimal, reflecting the benign static data nature.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is a benign, static color reference library with no indicators of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
