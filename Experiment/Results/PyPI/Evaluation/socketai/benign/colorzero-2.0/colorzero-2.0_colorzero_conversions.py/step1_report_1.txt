{
  "purpose": "This code provides various color conversion functions between different color spaces and representations, mainly for image processing and color manipulation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, import statements, and constants. It also accesses the 'NAMED_COLORS' dictionary from the '.tables' module for named color lookups.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that output or transform data, such as returning color values, converting to HTML color strings, or performing matrix operations. These are standard in color conversion but could be malicious if misused to leak data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., RGB values, color names, or HTML color strings) through conversion functions, potentially involving lookup tables or mathematical transformations, resulting in color representations or HTML strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. The code uses standard libraries, no obfuscated language features, no dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names. The import of 'Fraction' and the use of precise mathematical operations appear typical for color calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard color space conversions with mathematically sound algorithms. Functions convert between linear RGB, sRGB, YIQ, YUV, XYZ, Luv, Lab, CMY, and CMYK. It includes utility functions for clamping and type conversions. The use of lookup tables for named colors and precise mathematical transformations indicates intended use in color processing. No network, file I/O, or system command execution is present. No suspicious behaviors like data exfiltration, remote connections, or system modifications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, legitimate color conversion library with no malicious intent. It appears to be a standard implementation for color manipulation, relying on mathematical transformations and lookup tables. There is no evidence of malware or security risks in this code segment.",
