  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code, the described data flows, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes the code is legitimate, with no malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation, assigning malware=0 and securityRisk=0.2, and confidence=0.9.\n- **Review:** The code is a standard color conversion library, using well-known formulas, lookup tables, and safe mathematical operations. No dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious behavior is detected.\n- **Verdict:** The malware score of 0 aligns with the code's content. The security risk score is low, given the absence of external data leaks or system modifications.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's scoring seems reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it concludes the code is legitimate, with malware=0, securityRisk=0, and confidence=1.\n- **Review:** The functions are straightforward, based on standard formulas, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The scoring appears appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the report finds no malicious activity, with malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, and confidence=1.\n- **Review:** The functions are standard, with safe mathematical transformations, no external data leaks, or system manipulations.\n- **Verdict:** The low security risk score reflects the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious activity detected, malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Review:** The functions are purely mathematical, with no network or file I/O, and no obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** The scoring is consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion—no malicious intent, malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Review:** The code is standard, with well-understood formulas, safe data handling, and no suspicious behaviors.\n- **Verdict:** The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify the code as a standard, well-structured color conversion library.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all cases, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), reflecting minimal security concerns.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, standard color processing functions)\n\n**Rationale:** The code performs standard color space conversions, uses common libraries, and contains no suspicious patterns, external communications, or hidden behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are consistent and reasonable. The scores reflect the benign, standard nature of the code. No adjustments needed.",
