{
  "purpose": "Provide color space conversion functions and utilities for colorzero, including conversions between RGB, YIQ, YUV, XYZ, and other color models.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters such as RGB values, color names, HTML color strings, and matrices.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include converted color values, which are used internally; no external data sinks or sensitive data output observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through various conversion functions, with no external or untrusted data sources leading to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. The code is mainly mathematical and conversion-focused with standard libraries; no obfuscated code, network calls, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of color space conversion functions utilizing standard mathematical formulas, external libraries (colorsys), and predefined constants. It includes safe data handling, with proper clamping functions and validation. No network activity, external data transmission, or file manipulation is present. The functions are mathematical and standard in color processing, with no suspicious side-effects or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of color conversion routines with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, uses common libraries, and performs calculations solely for color space transformations. No malicious code or security vulnerabilities are apparent.",
