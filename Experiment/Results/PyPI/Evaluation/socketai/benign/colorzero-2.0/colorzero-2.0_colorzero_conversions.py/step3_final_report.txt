  "purpose": "Provides functions for converting between various color spaces and formats, including RGB, YIQ, YUV, CMY, CMYK, HLS, HSV, XYZ, Luv, and Lab, based on standard color science formulas and references.",
  "sources": "Input data from color space values (e.g., RGB, XYZ, YUV, etc.), including functions that read color component values and lookup tables for named colors.",
  "sinks": "Outputs converted color values in different formats; no external data sinks or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input color components through mathematical transformations and lookup functions to produce output in target color spaces or formats.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; functions perform standard mathematical operations without obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard color space conversions using well-known formulas, with safe mathematical operations, lookup tables, and no external system interactions. The functions are straightforward, referencing reputable sources, and do not contain obfuscation or malicious code. No external data leaks, network activity, or system modifications are evident. The code's purpose is purely computational, serving as a utility library for color conversions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured color conversion library with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1). The existing reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
