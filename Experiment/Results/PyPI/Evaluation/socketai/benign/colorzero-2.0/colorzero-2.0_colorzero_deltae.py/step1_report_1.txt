{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for calculating color differences using various algorithms (Euclidean, CIE76, CIE1994, CIEDE2000) in color space computations.",
  "sources": "Imports from the math module (sqrt, atan2, degrees, radians, sin, cos, exp); no external inputs are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform network or system operations.",
  "flows": "There are no untrusted data flows, as the code solely performs mathematical calculations with parameters assumed to be color objects with numeric attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Function implementations are straightforward mathematical formulas.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for color difference calculations based on well-known color difference formulas. All functions rely on mathematical operations and do not handle external inputs or outputs, avoiding common injection or data leakage issues. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, system modification, or data theft. The code appears to be a standard implementation of color difference algorithms, with proper use of mathematical functions and clear documentation. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign mathematical library implementing color difference formulas without any malicious intent or security risks. It performs straightforward calculations with no external dependencies or data handling that could lead to security concerns.",
