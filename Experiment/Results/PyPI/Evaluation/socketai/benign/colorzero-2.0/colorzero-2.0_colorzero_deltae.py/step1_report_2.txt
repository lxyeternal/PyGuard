{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for calculating color difference metrics such as Euclidean, CIE76, CIE1994, and CIEDE2000 for color comparison purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for color difference functions (color1, color2), which are expected to be objects with attributes (l, a, b) or sequences representing color components.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; functions perform mathematical calculations and return numeric results.",
  "flows": "Input objects flow into functions, leading to mathematical operations, attribute access, and calculations; no data is sent to external sources or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the code strictly performs mathematical color difference calculations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for calculating various color difference metrics, including Euclidean, CIE76, CIE1994 (with graphical and textile biases), and CIEDE2000. All functions perform standard mathematical operations, attribute accesses, and established algorithms for color difference. There are no external data inputs, network communications, or file manipulations. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious logic is present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of established color difference formulas, with clear documentation and adherence to standard algorithms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of color difference algorithms with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain any malware, backdoors, or security risks. The functions perform mathematical calculations based on input objects representing colors. No external data leaks or dangerous operations are present.",
