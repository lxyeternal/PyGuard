  "purpose": "Provides functions to calculate color differences using various algorithms (Euclidean, CIE76, CIE94, CIEDE2000).",
  "sources": "Input color objects with attributes (l, a, b) or sequences; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Returns numerical difference values; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input attributes -> mathematical calculations -> output difference score.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard, well-documented color difference formulas relying solely on mathematical operations. It operates on input parameters representing colors with attributes, with no external data handling, network activity, or system modifications. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk ~0.1) are consistent with the benign, purely computational nature of the code. Given the absence of external effects or vulnerabilities, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of color difference algorithms with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0, and the security risk score can be lowered to 0 for accuracy.",
