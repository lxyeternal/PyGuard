{
  "purpose": "The code provides algorithms for calculating color differences between color objects, useful for color comparison and analysis in graphics or design applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input color objects (color1, color2), specifically their attributes 'a', 'b', 'l'. It also reads constants for mathematical calculations from imported modules (math functions).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code performs purely mathematical computations without writing or transmitting data outside its scope.",
  "flows": "Input color data (attributes) flows into difference calculation functions, which process these attributes to output a numeric difference value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious logic are present. The code uses standard mathematical operations and well-known formulas for color difference calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple functions implementing standard color difference formulas (Euclidean, CIE76, CIE94, CIEDE2000). It imports math functions and operates on color object attributes. There are no network operations, file I/O, or code execution features that could be malicious. The functions are straightforward and well-documented. No obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of color difference algorithms with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It strictly performs mathematical calculations based on input color attributes and follows standard formulas.",
