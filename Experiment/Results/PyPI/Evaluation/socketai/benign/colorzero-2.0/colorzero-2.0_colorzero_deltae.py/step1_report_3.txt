{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for calculating various color difference metrics (Euclidean, CIE 1976, CIE 1994, CIEDE 2000) used in color analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters (color1, color2, method), specifically color attributes like 'l', 'a', 'b'. No external data sources or inputs are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present. The code performs mathematical computations only.",
  "flows": "Input color objects flow through difference functions to compute color difference metrics. No data flows to external systems, networks, or files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, system calls, or network communications. No obfuscated or dynamically executed code. Function implementations are straightforward mathematical calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions for computing color differences based on standard formulas. The functions rely solely on input parameters and perform mathematical calculations. No external inputs, system commands, network calls, or file I/O are present. No indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage. The code appears to be a legitimate library for color difference calculations, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate mathematical library for color difference calculations. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, no backdoors, and no suspicious activity. It is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
