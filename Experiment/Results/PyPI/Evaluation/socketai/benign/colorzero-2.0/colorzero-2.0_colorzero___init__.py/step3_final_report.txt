{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package for color manipulation, providing classes and functions for color representation and attribute manipulation.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.color, .easings, .deltae, .attr, .types, .tables) which are used for color data and functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process external input or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "The code flows from imported modules to class and function definitions, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard library module with documentation and imports only.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured Python module for color manipulation, with no executable logic or suspicious behavior. The reports provided are empty, indicating no issues or findings. The absence of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities suggests a benign package. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be minimal or zero, consistent with the lack of evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities detected. The empty reports confirm the absence of issues. The package appears safe for use.",
