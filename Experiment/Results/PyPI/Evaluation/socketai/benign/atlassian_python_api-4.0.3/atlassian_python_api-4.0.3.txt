The high security risk score in some reports (e.g., 0.95) is unjustified given the benign nature of the code. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), mainly reflecting standard file handling and API interactions. The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or sabotage elements."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API wrapper for Atlassian's roadmap API, with no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or supply chain compromise. The only minor concern is the ability to send arbitrary data via 'import_workitem', which is standard for API clients and not inherently malicious. Overall, the code is safe and benign."

The low risk score of 0.2 is justified by the nature of the wrapper and its potential for misuse if inputs are malicious, but no actual malicious activity is present."
