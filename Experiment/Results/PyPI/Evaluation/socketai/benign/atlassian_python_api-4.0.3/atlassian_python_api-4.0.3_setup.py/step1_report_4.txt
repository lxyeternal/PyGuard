{
  "purpose": "The script configures the setup for the 'atlassian-python-api' Python package, defining its metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading the version number from 'atlassian/VERSION' file; reading long description from 'README.rst'; static data in the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks identified; setup metadata is static or from local files, not from user input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the version and description files into setup configuration; no flow of untrusted data to execution sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected; standard setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version information from a local file and long description from a README file, then uses setuptools to define package metadata. All data sources are local files, with no dynamic or user-supplied inputs involved. The setup parameters are static and conform to typical packaging procedures. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads local files and defines package metadata, posing no threat.",
