  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for the 'atlassian-python-api' library, defining metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'atlassian/VERSION' and long description from 'README.rst'.",
  "sinks": "None; static data used for package metadata, no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Static file reads to setup parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads static files for versioning and description, then passes this data to setuptools.setup(). It involves no user input, environment variables, network activity, or obfuscated code. All data sources are trusted and static. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code structure and content are standard for Python package distribution, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard package setup file with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code analysis.",
