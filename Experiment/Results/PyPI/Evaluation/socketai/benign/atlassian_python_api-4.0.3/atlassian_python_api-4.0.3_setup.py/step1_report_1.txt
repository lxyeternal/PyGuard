  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package named 'atlassian-python-api' with metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'atlassian/VERSION' file for version info, reading 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "No external data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; data reads are static files for package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code follows standard setup.py structure.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading version and description files, configuring package metadata, dependencies, classifiers. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious operations. All inputs are from trusted static files, and no network or environment variable manipulations are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python setup script for packaging. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements. It is safe and intended for distribution purposes.",
