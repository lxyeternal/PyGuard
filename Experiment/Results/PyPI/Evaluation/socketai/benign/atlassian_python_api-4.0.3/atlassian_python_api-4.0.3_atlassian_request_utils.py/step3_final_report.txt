  "purpose": "Utility functions for managing Python loggers, ensuring compatibility across Python versions and preventing logging errors by adding NullHandler when necessary.",
  "sources": "Logger objects accessed via getLogger, checking for handlers, and adding handlers if absent.",
  "sinks": "No external data, input, or output; internal logger configuration only.",
  "flows": "Logger creation and handler check/addition within the logging system; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard practice for logger management.",
  "analysis": "The code provides compatibility for Python 2 and 3 when checking for logger handlers and ensures a NullHandler is added if no handlers are present, preventing logging errors. It does not process external data, execute network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The code aligns with best practices for logging setup, and all signals indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for safe logger configuration across Python versions. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
