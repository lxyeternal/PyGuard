  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client for Jira Insight with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score of 0.2 is justified by the nature of the wrapper and its potential for misuse if inputs are malicious, but no actual malicious activity is present."
