  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issues Confirmed:** No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity are present.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The report correctly notes deprecated and unimplemented methods but correctly identifies these as non-malicious. The logic is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score aligns with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issues Confirmed:** JSON parse error is noted, but the report focuses on the API wrapper's legitimacy.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The JSON parse error indicates potential malformed responses, but since this is just a report note, it doesn't imply malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior; the code is a legitimate API client.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issues Confirmed:** Similar to above, standard API wrapper behavior with no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No significant flaws; the analysis is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issues Confirmed:** Again, a standard API wrapper with no malicious signs.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No suspicious code or network activity; handling of files and API calls appears safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — fitting.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issues Confirmed:** Similar to previous reports, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** No issues found; analysis is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify zero malware risk.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Consistently low at 0.2, justified by the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- The code is a straightforward API wrapper for Jira Insight.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-critical issues are present.\n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the detailed analysis.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, given incomplete features but no security concerns)\n\n**In conclusion,** the reports are accurate and consistent. The code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious intent.",
