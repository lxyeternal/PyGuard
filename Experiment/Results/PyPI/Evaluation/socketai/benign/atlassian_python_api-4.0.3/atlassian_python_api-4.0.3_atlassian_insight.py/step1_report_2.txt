  "raw_response": "{\n  \"purpose\": \"This code provides a wrapper API for interacting with Atlassian Insight (for Jira), enabling operations such as retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting Insight objects, schemas, attachments, comments, icons, and indexing.\",\n  \"sources\": \"Data is read from function parameters (e.g., object_id, filename, comment, insight_keys), API responses (via self.get()), and local files (for uploads).\",\n  \"sinks\": \"Potential sinks include HTTP POST/PUT/DELETE requests with parameters or files, especially in functions like upload_attachment_to_object(), update_issue_insight_field(), and delete_attachment(). These could be exploited if untrusted data is injected into request bodies or URLs.\",\n  \"flows\": \"Untrusted input (e.g., object_id, filename, comment, insight_keys) flows into API request parameters, URL construction, and file uploads. Data retrieved from API responses (e.g., result[\"values\"]) is used internally without evident harmful side effects. For example, filename in upload_attachment_to_object() is read directly from input, and URL parameters are constructed dynamically, but without apparent code injection mechanisms.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code correctly avoids dangerous dynamic code execution. The functions handle files securely during upload with context managers. No suspicious network behavior is evident; all network requests appear to be legitimate API calls. No malicious privacy violations are detected. Usage of deprecated functions is noted but not malicious.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code acts as an API wrapper to perform various operations with Insight objects in Jira. It uses standard HTTP methods and safely handles file operations. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are observed. The URL construction relies on internal methods like url_joiner(), which are assumed safe. Data passed to HTTP requests originates from function arguments or API responses, with no evident code injection vectors. The functions that interact with external files or URLs are straightforward and utilize safe Python practices. There is no evidence of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system damage, or covert channels. Deprecated methods are present but marked appropriately; they do not introduce security issues.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code functions as a legitimate API wrapper for Insight in Jira. It handles data securely, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security breaches. Although it interacts with external files and APIs, all operations appear intended for legitimate purposes. No malicious or sabotage behaviors are evident.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
