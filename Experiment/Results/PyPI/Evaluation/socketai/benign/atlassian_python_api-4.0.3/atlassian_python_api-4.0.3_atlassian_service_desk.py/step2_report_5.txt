  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security issues, and the reasoning behind the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Describes a standard API client for Jira Service Desk, reading data from parameters and external files, sending data via HTTP requests.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious logic. File uploads and plugin management are standard API operations.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, well-structured, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** The high risk score seems to reflect the potential danger of file uploads or resource management, but given the code's nature as an API client, these are standard operations. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain backdoors. The confidence is high.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on reading data from parameters and files, sending data via HTTP, including plugin uploads.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious logic. The use of 'no-check' headers in 'attach_temporary_file' is API-compliant, not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior, standard API client. Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) reflects the potential for file handling vulnerabilities, but nothing malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The low malware score aligns with the analysis. The risk score is appropriate, considering the file upload operations.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Standard API client, reading data from parameters and files, sending over network.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or secrets. File handling is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity. Functionality is typical for such clients.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n\n**Assessment:** The low risk and malware scores are justified. The code is a typical API wrapper with no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Similar to above, with focus on data flow from inputs to network.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior. File uploads are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of sabotage or malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) possibly due to file handling, but still consistent with standard practices.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Standard API client, managing resources via HTTP.\n- **Anomalies & Risks:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The risk score reflects potential vulnerabilities in file handling but does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis. No malicious code, backdoors, or sabotage detected.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All zero, no obfuscation or hidden code.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) reflecting potential surface vulnerabilities in file handling, but nothing malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (considering file uploads and API interactions, but no malicious intent)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
