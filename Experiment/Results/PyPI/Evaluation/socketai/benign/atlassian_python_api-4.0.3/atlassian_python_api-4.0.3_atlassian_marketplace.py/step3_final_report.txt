  "purpose": "API wrapper class for Atlassian Marketplace, providing methods to retrieve plugins, vendors, applications, app versions, and reviews.",
  "sources": "Method parameters used to construct request URLs and query parameters; self.get() method performing HTTP GET requests.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is directly used in a way that leads to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (limit, offset, add_on_key, application, sort) are used to build URL paths and query parameters, then passed to self.get() for HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious routines detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client wrapper that constructs URLs and parameters based on method arguments. It relies on an inherited self.get() method to perform HTTP requests. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The parameters are used in a typical manner for REST API calls. The code is well-structured, with no logical flaws or suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with its benign, standard design.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API wrapper with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The current scores are appropriate and should be maintained.",
