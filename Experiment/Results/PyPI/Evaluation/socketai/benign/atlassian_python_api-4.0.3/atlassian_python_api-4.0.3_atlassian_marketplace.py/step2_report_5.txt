  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward API wrapper with no malicious behavior. It uses function parameters to build API requests and performs GET requests via self.get(). No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's reasoning is sound; no changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a standard API wrapper with safe parameter handling. No malicious patterns or suspicious behaviors detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; reasoning is consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a straightforward API client. No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The parameters are used in API requests, which is typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports; standard API wrapper, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent reasoning.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern; simple API client with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasoning is valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code presence of malware or obfuscation:** None detected. All reports agree.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The code constructs URLs with parameters from function arguments, but this is standard for API wrappers. No evidence of injection or malicious payloads.\n- **Malware score justification:** All reports assign malware=0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1), reflecting minimal security concern due to parameter handling, but overall very safe.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- The scores are consistent and justified.\n- Given the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities, I would keep the scores as they are.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious intent or code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minor, typical API wrapper risk, no significant vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the code appears safe, benign, and well-structured for its purpose.",
