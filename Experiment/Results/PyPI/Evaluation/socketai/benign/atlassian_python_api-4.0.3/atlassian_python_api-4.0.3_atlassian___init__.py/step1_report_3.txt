{
  "purpose": "This code defines module imports and exports for a package, primarily organizing references to various classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (e.g., .bamboo, .bitbucket, .confluence, etc.), defining __all__ for public API.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input/output or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply imports and exposes classes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. Multiple imports of the same module with aliases are normal for clarity.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports classes from sibling modules and defines a list of exported names. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The multiple imports with aliases (e.g., Bitbucket as Stash) are for naming clarity, not malicious intent. No indications of code obfuscation or malicious payloads. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import/export setup with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It does not read external input or perform any operations that could be exploited.",
