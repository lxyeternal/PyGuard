{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an index module that imports various classes from sibling modules and defines an __all__ list for package exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.bamboo, .bitbucket, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import/export statements only",
  "flows": "N/A - static imports and exports, no data flow or external data handling",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate imports with aliases (e.g., Bitbucket as Stash, Insight as Assets) are standard and not suspicious; no obfuscation or dynamic code present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package index file, importing classes and defining __all__ for exports. No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing is present. The duplicate imports with aliases are common for clarity. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are detected. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static module for organizing package exports. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
