{
  "purpose": "This code is a wrapper for the Statuspage API, providing methods to interact with various resources such as pages, incidents, subscribers, components, metrics, and access controls.",
  "sources": "Reads data from method parameters, local variables (URLs, data dictionaries), and potentially from external API responses via self.get/post/patch/delete methods.",
  "sinks": "Sinks include API request methods (get, post, patch, delete) which send data to external servers; no direct data leaks or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into API request URLs and payloads, with responses returned by API methods; no indications of malicious data flow or manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors are present. The code structure is straightforward and standard for an API wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes and enums to structure API interactions. It performs standard HTTP operations via methods like get, post, patch, and delete, with no dynamic code execution or untrusted input evaluation. All data flows appear to be controlled via function parameters, and no external data is used unsanitized. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured API client with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API wrapper for Statuspage, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain security risks detected. It functions as expected for a client library, and no indicators of sabotage or malware are present.",
