  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward API wrapper for Statuspage, with no malicious or suspicious code detected.\n- **Details:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The code is well-structured, purely functional, and relies on standard HTTP request patterns.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1, which is reasonable given the nature of an API client.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95, high confidence in the benign nature.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The code appears safe and well-implemented.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it confirms the code is a legitimate API wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Details:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic. Uses standard HTTP methods, with data flowing from parameters to API calls.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0, matching the logical assessment.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1, appropriate for an API client.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95, indicating strong confidence.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, confirms the code is a standard API wrapper with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Details:** Data flows are controlled, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0, aligned with the analysis.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1, appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, still high.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—it's a legitimate API wrapper with no malicious activity.\n- **Details:** Uses standard HTTP methods, no suspicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n- **Confidence:** 1, very high.\n\n**Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Consistent with previous reports; standard API client with no malicious signs.\n- **Details:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Data flows are controlled via parameters.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** None detected. All reports agree on the benign nature.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security Risk Scores:** Very low (0.1 or 0), reflecting the safe and standard nature of the code.\n- **Confidence Levels:** High (around 0.9-1), indicating strong certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores assigned across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the detailed analysis.\n- No adjustments needed; the code is a standard, well-structured API wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — Very low, typical for an API client.\n- **Confidence:** **0.95** — High confidence in the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, standard API wrapper for Statuspage, with no indications of supply chain security issues or malicious intent.",
