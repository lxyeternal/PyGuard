  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the provided code and the reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward API wrapper with no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. It uses standard HTTP methods and resource management functions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are detected.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code's structure. The code is a comprehensive API client, with no signs of malicious intent. The low security risk score (0.1) is reasonable, considering it's a wrapper with no embedded secrets.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a well-structured API wrapper with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. Data flows are from parameters to API requests, with no signs of data exfiltration or malicious payloads.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis matches the code's nature. The code only performs API interactions, with no embedded malicious code or dynamic evaluation. The risk score is appropriately low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a comprehensive, standard API wrapper with no signs of malicious activity. It handles data securely, with no obfuscation or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the previous reports. The code is a typical API client, and the risk score reflects minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard API wrapper, with data flowing from parameters into API requests. No malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors are detected.\n\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nHighly confident and consistent. No malicious or suspicious aspects are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a legitimate API wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, consistent with the overall analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** No. All reports agree on the absence of malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; all reports confirm straightforward, standard code.\n\n- **Security risk:** Very low, as the code is a client library that only performs API calls with parameters supplied externally. No embedded secrets or dangerous operations are present.\n\n- **Malware score justification:** Zero across all reports, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n- **Scores adjustment:** Given the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores, which are already very conservative and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, mainly due to the API wrapper nature, but no security concerns.\n\n**Note:** The code's purpose is purely to facilitate API interactions; it does not execute untrusted code, handle secrets insecurely, or perform any suspicious operations.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured API client with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided report scores are justified and should remain as is.",
