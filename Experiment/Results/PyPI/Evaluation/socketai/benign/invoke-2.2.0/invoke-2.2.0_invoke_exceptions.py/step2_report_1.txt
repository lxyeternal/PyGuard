  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's purpose, structure, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines custom exception classes and utility functions, no external data handling, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** The code is standard for error handling modules. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0. The confidence is high.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is safe, benign, and well-structured.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on exception classes for command execution, parsing, environment, and threading.\n- **Findings:** No external input processing, no data leaks, no malicious behavior. Utility functions for error display are safe.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1 (a very low, acceptable risk). Confidence is high.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard, safe, and free from malicious intent.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes for error reporting, control flow, and debugging.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted input handling, no external data processing, no malicious code. Exception classes are straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0. The analysis is consistent.\n- **Assessment:** Valid. The code is a typical exception hierarchy, safe and benign.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, exception classes for error handling.\n- **Findings:** No external data input, no unsafe operations, no malicious payloads. String formatting is for debugging, not security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0. The confidence is high.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard, safe, and non-malicious.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes with parameters for error reporting, no external input or data manipulation.\n- **Findings:** String formatting for error messages is typical; no malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor concern is potential for untrusted data in string representations, but these are for debugging purposes.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1 (very low). Confidence is high.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The code is safe, standard, and focused on error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports correctly identify that this code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes and utility functions for error handling. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk scores are justified given the nature of the code.\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\nThis code is a benign, standard component of an error handling framework, with no supply chain or security concerns.",
