  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes and utility functions for error handling and debugging within a Python application.",
  "sources": "Exception class constructors, string formatting in __str__ and _repr methods, utility function _printable_kwargs",
  "sinks": "String representations of exceptions, potential inclusion of untrusted data in error messages",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation -> __str__ or _repr methods -> error message output",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard use of string formatting for debugging",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of exception classes and a utility function, all designed for error reporting and debugging. No external data is processed, no network or code execution occurs. The string formatting could theoretically include untrusted data if exceptions are raised with such inputs, but this is typical for debugging and does not constitute malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and free from obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard error handling module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score reflects the minimal potential for information leakage via error messages, but no actual security flaw exists.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
