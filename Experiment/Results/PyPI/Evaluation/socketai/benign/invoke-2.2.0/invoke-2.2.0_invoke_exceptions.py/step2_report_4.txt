  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any issues are present.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code defines custom exception classes and utility functions, with no direct handling of untrusted input or data leakage. It finds no anomalies or suspicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical exception hierarchy with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain risks.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. The code is benign, and the scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code defines exception classes for error handling, with no external data sources or untrusted input handling. No malicious payloads or suspicious logic are detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.0.\n\n- **Assessment:** The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 is acceptable given the nature of exception classes that may log or display error info but do not process untrusted data directly. No issues found.\n\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The code remains benign, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines various exception classes for error reporting, with no malicious payloads or suspicious behaviors. Utility functions are standard, and no obfuscation or malicious intent is detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned. The code is straightforward, and the scoring reflects that.\n\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The exception classes are for error handling, with no external input reading or malicious behavior. The code is standard and safe.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Defines exception classes for error handling, with parameters from internal data, no untrusted sources. String formatting could include untrusted data, but mainly for debugging. No malicious patterns or obfuscation are present.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n- **Assessment:** The minor securityRisk score of 0.1 is acceptable, given that exception messages could include untrusted data if exceptions are raised with untrusted inputs. However, the code itself does not process untrusted data directly.\n\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate. The code is safe, and the scoring is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; malware=0 across all.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected; obfuscated=0.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly elevated in some reports (0.1), justified by the potential for exception messages to include untrusted data, but the code itself does not process such data directly. The scores are reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** All reports are confident (1), which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, standard exception class definitions.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, justified by potential for exception messages to include untrusted data, but overall safe.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured exception handling module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
