  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for the 'invoke' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reads the version info from 'invoke/_version.py', reads the 'README.rst' for long description, and gathers package data using find_packages.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and README content during setup, but these are static file reads without untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution beyond reading files.",
  "analysis": "The script loads version information from a file, reads a static README for description, and configures package setup parameters. It uses standard libraries and conventions for package distribution. No code injection, malicious network activity, or data leakage points are present. The only dynamic behavior is reading local files, which is typical for setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
