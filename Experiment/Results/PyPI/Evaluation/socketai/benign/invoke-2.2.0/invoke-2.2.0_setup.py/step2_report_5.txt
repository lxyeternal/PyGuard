  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose:** Standard setup for 'invoke' package.  \n- **Sources:** Reads version info from a file; reads README for description.  \n- **Sinks:** None; static configuration.  \n- **Flows:** No untrusted data flow; just file reads.  \n- **Anomalies:** None detected; uses exec() to read version info, which is common in setup scripts.  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; standard package setup.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate, no security issues.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent findings.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; standard setup script.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Also describes a typical setup.py, with no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same pattern: static file reads, no dynamic or external data.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Consistent with previous reports.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe setup script.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports confirm the code is a standard setup script with no suspicious or malicious constructs.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified; the use of `exec()` for version reading is common practice, albeit sometimes discouraged, but not malicious.  \n- **Scores:** All malware scores are zero, which aligns with the reports. The obfuscated and risk scores are also zero, which is justified given the static, well-understood nature of the code.  \n- **Claims based on assumptions:** No such claims are present; the reports are consistent and cautious, correctly identifying no security issues.  \n- **Consistency:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Remain at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk score:** 0, no security risk identified.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a legitimate, straightforward package setup script with no security concerns.",
