{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard setup script for the 'invoke' Python package, used to configure package metadata, versioning, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'invoke/_version.py' via exec(), reads README.rst for long description, static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static file reads with no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and README content; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses exec() to load version info, which is common but can be risky if the file is compromised; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading static files, defining package metadata, and configuring entry points. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code beyond reading local files. The use of exec() is a known pattern in setup scripts but should be trusted; no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. All security signals indicate a benign, legitimate package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The supply chain security risk here is negligible.",
