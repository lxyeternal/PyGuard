{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'invoke' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'invoke/_version.py' for version info, reading 'README.rst' for long_description, and package discovery via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the code primarily loads files and sets package metadata.",
  "flows": "File reads (version and README) are straightforward; no untrusted input flows to critical functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. No external data sources or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads version info from a local file, reads a static README for description, and calls setuptools.setup() with predefined package info. No user input, environment variables, or network activity involved. The code follows standard package setup procedures without suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
