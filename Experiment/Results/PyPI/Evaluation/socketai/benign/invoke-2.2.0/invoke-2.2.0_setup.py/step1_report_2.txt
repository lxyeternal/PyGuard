{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'invoke' Python package, used for task execution and automation.",
  "sources": "Reading the content of 'invoke/_version.py' to extract version information, reading 'README.rst' for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data is written or used in a way that could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "Version info is read from a file and assigned to a variable; no data flows into or out of untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs standard setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The code reads version information from a file and constructs a long description from a README file. It uses standard setup procedures with 'setuptools', includes multiple package metadata fields, and defines console scripts. No dynamic execution beyond reading files is performed. No suspicious or malicious patterns, code injection, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup.py script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.",
