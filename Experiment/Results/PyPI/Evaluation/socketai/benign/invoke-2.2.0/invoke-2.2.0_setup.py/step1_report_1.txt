{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the 'invoke' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'invoke/_version.py' file for version info, reading 'README.rst' for long description, and static strings within the setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static configuration with no external data or untrusted input processing.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs standard package setup routines. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for packaging, reads version info from a file without importing the module, constructs a long description from a README file, and sets up package metadata, entry points, classifiers, and project URLs. All operations involve static file reads or hardcoded strings. No dynamic code execution beyond reading files. No untrusted input handling, network activity, or sensitive data processing is present. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices without suspicious patterns or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate package setup script for 'invoke' with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for packaging purposes only.",
