{
  "purpose": "Defines core classes and functions for managing and executing tasks in a task automation framework, including task registration, invocation, and argument handling.",
  "sources": "Imports modules like inspect, types, copy, functools, and typing; reads function signatures, function bodies, and class attributes; processes user-provided parameters and options.",
  "sinks": "Executes task functions with arguments, creates Context objects, and handles deep copying of data. No untrusted data handling, network connections, or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "User calls decorators or functions that create Task objects; Task objects invoke user-defined callables; Call objects manage execution parameters; task functions are executed with controlled args/kwargs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures; no hardcoded credentials, network activity, file system manipulation, obfuscation, or backdoors present. The code is a standard task management implementation with no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a framework for defining, handling, and invoking tasks with detailed argument specifications. It uses standard libraries and patterns for introspection, argument parsing, and function wrapping. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network operations, credential theft, or system damage. The code is well-structured and appears to serve its intended purpose without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard task management module with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles task registration and invocation safely, with no network or system tampering observed. The overall security risk is minimal.",
