{
  "purpose": "Defines core classes and decorators for task management and execution, enabling task registration, invocation, and argument specification.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (`inspect`, `types`, `deepcopy`, `update_wrapper`, typing) and reads task-related parameters and attributes within classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; the code primarily defines class structures, decorators, and method logic for task invocation.",
  "flows": "The flow involves decorating functions to create Task objects, which are later called via the __call__ method, generating Contexts and executing the task's body.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The code adheres to standard patterns for a task management library.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a task framework with classes for task representation (`Task`), task invocation (`Call`), and a decorator (`task`) for marking functions as tasks. It employs standard Python features such as introspection (`inspect.signature`), dynamic attribute management, and deep copying. No malicious logic, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are detected. All functions and classes serve explicit purposes related to task management without any hidden or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The source code appears to be a legitimate task management framework with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard design patterns and does not contain any obfuscated or harmful code. The overall security risk is low.",
