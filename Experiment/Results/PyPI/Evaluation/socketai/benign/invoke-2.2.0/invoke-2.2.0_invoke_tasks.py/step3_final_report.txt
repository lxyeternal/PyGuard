{
  "purpose": "Defines a core framework for creating, managing, and executing tasks with argument parsing and decorators.",
  "sources": "Imports standard modules (inspect, types, copy, functools, typing) and local modules (.context, .parser). Reads function signatures, attributes, and user-defined task functions.",
  "sinks": "Execution of user-defined task functions via self.body(*args, **kwargs). Creation of Argument objects for CLI parsing. Dynamic attribute access in Call objects.",
  "flows": "Decorators create Task instances; Task objects invoke user functions; Call objects encapsulate deferred execution and cloning.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Usage of introspection and dynamic features is standard for such frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard task management system, employing common patterns for CLI task registration, argument handling, and invocation. No signs of malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic features used are typical for CLI frameworks and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe task management framework with no malicious activity or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk score are justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
