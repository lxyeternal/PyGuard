  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Issue Presence**:  \n   The code snippet:\n   ```python\n   __version_info__ = (2, 2, 0)\n   __version__ = \".\".join(map(str, __version_info__))\n   ```\n   is a standard pattern for defining a version tuple and a version string in Python. It assigns a tuple with version numbers and then creates a string representation.  \n   **No issues are present** in the code itself; it is straightforward and typical for version management.\n\n2. **Logical & Reasoning Flaws**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is simple, with no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behaviors.  \n   **No logical flaws or reasoning errors** are evident.\n\n3. **Scores & Their Justification**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: The code is clear, not obfuscated. All reports agree on this.  \n   - **Malware Score (0)**: There are no signs of malicious behavior—no network activity, no code injection, no suspicious functions.  \n   - **Security Risk Score (0)**: The code poses no security risk; it’s just version assignment.  \n   \n   All scores seem appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Claims about Vulnerabilities**:  \n   The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as benign. No assumptions are made beyond the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n5. **Consistency & Reasonableness of Scores**:  \n   The scores assigned (all zeros for obfuscated, malware, and risk) are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:  \n   - Since the code is static, with no external inputs or dynamic behaviors, the malware score should remain at 0.  \n   - The risk score is also correctly 0, as there's no potential for exploitation here.\n\n**Final assessment & personal estimates**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (code is clear and straightforward)  \n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary**:  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, standard version management code, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are needed.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**:  \n- The code is safe and typical for version management.  \n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified.  \n- No further action or concern is warranted.",
