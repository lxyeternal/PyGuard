  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Reads the version tuple (__version_info__) to generate a version string (__version__).",
  "sinks": "None, as the code only assigns and constructs a string from internal variables.",
  "flows": "From __version_info__ to __version__ via string join operation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version string construction from internal data.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a tuple __version_info__ with version numbers. It then creates a string __version__ by joining the tuple elements with periods. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code is typical for version management in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply manages version information and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is a standard pattern for defining package version strings.",
