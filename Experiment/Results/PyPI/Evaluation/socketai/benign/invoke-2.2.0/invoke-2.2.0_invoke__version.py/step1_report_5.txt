  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard version declaration pattern",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version tuple to __version_info__ and then constructs a string __version__ by joining the tuple elements. There are no input sources or untrusted data involved, and no external calls or dynamic code execution. The code is straightforward, standard version handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical version declaration snippet with no malicious intent or security risks.",
