  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a tuple to __version_info__ and then creates a version string __version__ by joining the tuple elements. This is a standard pattern for managing package versioning in Python. No external inputs, no data leaks, no suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and typical for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define version information with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
