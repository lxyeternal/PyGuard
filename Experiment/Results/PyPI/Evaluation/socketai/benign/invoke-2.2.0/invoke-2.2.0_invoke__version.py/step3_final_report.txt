  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package using a tuple and string join.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static assignment of version tuple.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; static code.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version tuple and converts it into a string. It involves no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify the benign and standard nature of this code. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to zero, reflecting no malicious or risky behavior. The code is clear, simple, and typical for version management in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It poses no security risk. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature. No further action or concern is warranted.",
