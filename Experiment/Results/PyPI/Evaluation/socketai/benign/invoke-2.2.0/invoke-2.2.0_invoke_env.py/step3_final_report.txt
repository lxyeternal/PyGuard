  "purpose": "Load environment variables into a nested configuration structure, performing typecasting based on existing config values.",
  "sources": "os.environ for environment variables matching config keys with the specified prefix.",
  "sinks": "self.data dictionary where environment variables are stored after processing and typecasting.",
  "flows": "Environment variables (os.environ) influence self.data via _path_set, following key paths derived from config structure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity; straightforward recursion and typecasting.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard environment variable loader that traverses nested config structures, constructs env var names, detects conflicts, and performs typecasting. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external activity is present. It handles conflicts and uncastable values with exceptions, and the logic is sound. The use of environment variables for configuration is typical, and the code does not perform any network or file operations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign and transparent nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured environment variable loader with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk is justified by reliance on environment variables, which is standard practice. The scores across reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
