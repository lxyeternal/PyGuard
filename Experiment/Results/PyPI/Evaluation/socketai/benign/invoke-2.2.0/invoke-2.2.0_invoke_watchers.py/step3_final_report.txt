  "purpose": "Classes for monitoring subprocess streams and automating responses based on pattern matching, primarily for process interaction automation.",
  "sources": "Input streams from subprocesses (stdout/stderr), pattern strings, response strings.",
  "sinks": "Responses sent to subprocess stdin; no external network or file output.",
  "flows": "Stream data is matched against regex patterns; upon match, responses are yielded and sent to subprocess input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Regex patterns are compiled at runtime, but not obfuscated or maliciously crafted.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward pattern matching and response automation utility. It uses regex searches without precompilation, which is a minor performance concern but not security-related. No dynamic code execution, external network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The classes are designed for subprocess interaction, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The pattern matching and response logic are standard, and parameters are set during instantiation, not sourced from untrusted inputs. The security risk is minimal, primarily potential misuse if responses or patterns are externally manipulated, but this is inherent to such utilities and not indicative of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign subprocess interaction utility employing pattern matching for automated responses. No malicious or obfuscated elements are present. Security risks are low and primarily relate to potential misuse, which is typical for such automation tools. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
