  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate and standard implementation for task orchestration with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of dynamically loaded modules, which is outside static analysis scope but common in plugin architectures. Overall, the code is safe with a low inherent security risk."
