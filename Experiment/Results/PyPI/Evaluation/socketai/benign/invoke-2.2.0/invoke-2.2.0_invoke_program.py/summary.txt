  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard CLI task runner with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is ensuring configuration files and module sources are validated and trusted to prevent loading malicious modules. Scores reflect this: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.2 due to dynamic import potential. Overall, the code is safe for use in controlled environments with proper configuration validation."
