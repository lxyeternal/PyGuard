  "purpose": "Build and test automation tasks using Invoke, wrapping shell commands for CI/CD workflows.",
  "sources": "Configuration files, environment variables, static parameters within functions.",
  "sinks": "Shell commands executed via c.run() and os.system(), with controlled command strings.",
  "flows": "Parameters and configuration data flow into shell commands; no untrusted user input influences command strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build/test automation tasks, executing controlled shell commands. Inputs are static or from configuration, and no untrusted data influences command execution. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of subprocess calls is safe given the controlled parameters. Overall, the code is typical for CI/CD workflows and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured build automation with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a low risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
