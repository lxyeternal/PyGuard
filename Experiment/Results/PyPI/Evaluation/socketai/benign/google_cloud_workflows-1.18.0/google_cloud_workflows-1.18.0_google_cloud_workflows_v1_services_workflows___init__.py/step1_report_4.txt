  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that exports classes for interacting with workflows, likely part of a larger SDK or client library.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes 'WorkflowsAsyncClient' and 'WorkflowsClient' from local modules, which are sources of functionality.",
  "targets": "The code defines __all__ to expose these classes for external use, but does not perform any data processing, input reading, or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code merely imports and exposes classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple module setup that imports classes and defines an export list. It does not handle user input, perform network operations, or execute any dynamic code. The licensing comments are standard and not suspicious. No malicious patterns or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module initialization with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be part of an SDK or client library intended for public use.",
