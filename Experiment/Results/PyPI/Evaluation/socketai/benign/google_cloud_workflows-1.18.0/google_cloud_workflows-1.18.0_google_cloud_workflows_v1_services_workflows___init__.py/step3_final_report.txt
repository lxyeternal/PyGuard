{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer that imports and exports specific classes for external use, typical in SDKs or package setups.",
  "sources": "The code reads static import statements from local modules (.async_client and .client). No untrusted input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects, as the code only defines imports and exports.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: static imports from local modules, then defining __all__ for export; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The only minor anomaly is the copyright year '2025', which is in the future and likely a placeholder or typo. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static module setup with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. It imports classes and defines __all__, which is standard practice. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security. The code is clear, straightforward, and aligns with benign SDK initialization files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. The minor anomaly (future year) is not security-relevant. Overall, the code is safe and standard.",
