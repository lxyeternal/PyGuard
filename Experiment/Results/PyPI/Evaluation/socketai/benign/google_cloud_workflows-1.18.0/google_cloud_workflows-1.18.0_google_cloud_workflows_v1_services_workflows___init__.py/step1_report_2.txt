{
  "purpose": "Module exports for Workflow client classes, facilitating usage of synchronous and asynchronous clients.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.async_client and .client), module metadata comments, and __all__ declaration.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors detected. The comments include a 2025 copyright date, which is inconsistent with current year but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, module metadata comments, and an __all__ declaration to specify exported symbols. There are no dynamic executions, external network interactions, or data processing logic. No signs of obfuscated code, malware, or security issues are present. The incorrect copyright year (2025) may be a typo but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for exporting client classes, with no malicious or security concerns detected. It appears benign and follows typical patterns for Python packages.",
