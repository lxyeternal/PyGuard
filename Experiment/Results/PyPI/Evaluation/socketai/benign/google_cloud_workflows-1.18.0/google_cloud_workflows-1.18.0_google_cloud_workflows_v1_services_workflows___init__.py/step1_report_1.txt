{
  "purpose": "The code defines module exports for WorkflowsClient and WorkflowsAsyncClient, likely for a Python SDK or library related to workflows management.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules (.async_client and .client). No input or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, output, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only imports classes and sets __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious behavior detected. The license comment appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing specific classes and defining exports for the module. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. It appears to be a typical Python module for exporting classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and standard for a Python package's __init__.py or module export file. No malicious intent or security issues detected.",
