{
  "purpose": "This code is a module that imports and exposes classes for synchronous and asynchronous workflow clients, likely for interacting with a workflow management API or system.",
  "sources": "The code reads package-level import statements and metadata comments; specifically, the imports from .async_client and .client modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data output points are present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or transmission occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a comment with a copyright year set to 2025, which is in the future relative to the current date (October 2023), possibly indicating an anomaly or placeholder. The rest of the code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, involving only import statements, comments, and an __all__ declaration for module exports. No dynamic execution, user input, or external data handling is present. The presence of a future copyright year may be an oversight but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder or typo but not harmful.",
