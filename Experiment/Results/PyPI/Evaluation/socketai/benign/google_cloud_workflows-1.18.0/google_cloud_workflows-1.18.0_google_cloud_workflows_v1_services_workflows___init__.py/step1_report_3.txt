  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports for a client library related to workflows, specifically for synchronous and asynchronous clients.",
  "sources": "Imports from .async_client and .client modules, and the __all__ declaration",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present; the code only imports and exports classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior observed. Comments are standard licensing statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements and an __all__ declaration, which are standard for Python modules. No user input, environment variables, or external data are handled. No execution of dynamic code, network activity, or credential handling occurs here. The licensing comments are typical and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module setup for exporting classes related to workflows clients. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks in this snippet.",
