  "purpose": "This code appears to be a header comment section with licensing information for a Python file, likely intended for documentation or legal compliance purposes.",
  "sources": "The code sources are the license comments at the top of the file, which contain licensing details and copyright information.",
  "sinks": "There are no runtime data flows, inputs, or outputs in this code segment, as it only consists of comments.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists, since the code is only comments and licensing information.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious code features; the content is purely licensing boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed solely of comment blocks providing licensing and copyright information. No executable code, data input, or data output occurs here. The presence of a copyright statement from 2025 is unusual but not inherently suspicious; it could be a placeholder or a future date. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or security risks within comments.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, serving as licensing boilerplate without any malicious or security-related concerns.",
