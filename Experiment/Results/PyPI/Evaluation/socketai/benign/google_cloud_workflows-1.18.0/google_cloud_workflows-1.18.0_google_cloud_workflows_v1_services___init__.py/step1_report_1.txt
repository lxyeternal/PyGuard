{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a licensing and copyright header, typically used in Python source files for open-source projects.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code segment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code does not process data or execute logic beyond the comments.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the copyright year '2025', which is in the future relative to the current date, but this is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments defining licensing information, copyright, and legal notices. There are no executable statements, no input/output operations, and no suspicious or malicious code present. It is a standard header block used in source files. No anomalies related to security, malware, or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign license header with no malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain executable code or security risks.",
