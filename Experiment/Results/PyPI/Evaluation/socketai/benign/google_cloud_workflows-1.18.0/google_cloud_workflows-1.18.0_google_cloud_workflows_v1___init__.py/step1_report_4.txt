{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for interacting with Google Cloud Workflows API, defining imports and exposing classes and request types for workflow management.",
  "sources": "Import statements from google.cloud.workflows_v1 and local module attributes",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or executed",
  "flows": "Imports serve as sources; no data flows to sinks that could cause security issues",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs observed; license and copyright notices are standard and not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a module setup with import statements and exports of classes and request types. It does not perform data processing, network operations, or any dynamic code execution. The license and copyright comments are standard. The imports are from the official Google Cloud client library, with no indication of malicious code or behavior. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward, benign module that exposes classes and types for Google Cloud Workflows interaction. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain threats.",
