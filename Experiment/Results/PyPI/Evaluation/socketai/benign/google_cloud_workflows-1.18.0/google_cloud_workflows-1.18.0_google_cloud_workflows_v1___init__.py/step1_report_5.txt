  "purpose": "The code is a Python module that provides client classes and request/response types for interacting with Google Cloud Workflows API.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.cloud.workflows_v1 and local module imports.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. License and copyright comments are standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and classes from Google Cloud SDK, assigns version info, and exports certain classes and request types via __all__. All operations are static imports and definitions with no input handling or external data processing. No suspicious patterns, such as network activity, environment variable usage, or data manipulation, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign module providing client interfaces for Google Cloud Workflows API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
