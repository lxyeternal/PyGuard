{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer for the Google Cloud Workflows SDK, importing version info, client classes, request/response types, and defining the public API exports.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from external SDK modules and local type/class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process, transmit, or receive data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports and exports symbols without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard licensing comments and import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Python module acting as an SDK interface, with no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data processing. All reports correctly identify it as boilerplate, benign, and free of malicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature. The high confidence levels reflect the clear, static structure. There are no signs of supply chain attacks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK module with no security risks or malicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
