  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard Python module, likely an `__init__.py` or similar, setting up imports and exports for the Google Cloud Workflows SDK.\n- All reports agree that the code is boilerplate, with no data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or anomalies are identified.\n- The license comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- The code sources are trusted modules from Google's SDK and local type/class definitions.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected. The code is purely for exposing classes and constants.\n- **Data flows or sinks:** No data is processed, transmitted, or received; the code only imports and exports.\n- **Anomalies or suspicious patterns:** None. All reports confirm standard SDK structure.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Malware potential:** None evident.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent.\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (appropriate, given no issues)\n\n**Justification for scores:**\n- Since the code is static, does not handle untrusted input, and contains no malicious logic, the malware score remains zero.\n- The obfuscated score is zero because there's no obfuscation.\n- The overall security risk is negligible, so zero is justified.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, standard SDK boilerplate, with no signs of security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis. No further action or concern is warranted based on this code snippet.",
