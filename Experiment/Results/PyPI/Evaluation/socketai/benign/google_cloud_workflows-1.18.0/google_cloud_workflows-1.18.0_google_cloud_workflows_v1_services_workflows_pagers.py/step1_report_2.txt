{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for paginating through Google Cloud Workflows API responses, both synchronously and asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the request objects and API response objects; accesses response attributes.",
  "sinks": "Yields workflow objects from API responses; no direct data sinks that handle untrusted input or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "From API request methods to response objects; iterates through response pages; yields workflow data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Code structure is standard for API pagination. No obfuscated or suspicious language features.",
  "analysis": "The code provides paginated iterators for listing workflows and their revisions from Google Cloud Workflows API. It safely wraps API responses, handling pagination with retries and async support. No input data from external sources appears to be processed insecurely. No suspicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious intent is evident. The classes and functions strictly facilitate API data access and pagination.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, safe implementation of API response pagination wrappers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. The code is well-structured and intended for safe use with Google Cloud API responses.",
