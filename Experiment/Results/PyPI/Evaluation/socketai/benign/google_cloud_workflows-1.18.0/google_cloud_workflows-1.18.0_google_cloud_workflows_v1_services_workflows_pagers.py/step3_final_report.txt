  "purpose": "The code provides pagination wrappers for iterating through Google Cloud Workflows API responses, handling request/response objects, pagination tokens, retries, and metadata.",
  "sources": "API response objects, request objects, method call functions",
  "sinks": "Yielding workflow data; no untrusted data sinks or external system modifications",
  "flows": "API method calls → response handling → pagination token updates → yielding workflows",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious data flows detected",
  "analysis": "The classes implement standard pagination logic for API responses, with proper handling of next_page_token, retries, and asynchronous iteration. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward, typical for generated or library-provided API clients, and does not process untrusted data in a harmful way.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of API pagination wrappers for Google Cloud Workflows. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk stems from the handling of untrusted API responses, which is inherent to such wrappers but not malicious.",
