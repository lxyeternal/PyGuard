No backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low; primarily related to potential data exposure if responses contain sensitive info, but not malicious.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard API pagination code with negligible security concern)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured pagination utility for Google Cloud Workflows API responses. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The minor security risk is due to potential exposure of sensitive data in responses, which is typical for API data handling but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further detailed analysis or have additional reports to review.",
