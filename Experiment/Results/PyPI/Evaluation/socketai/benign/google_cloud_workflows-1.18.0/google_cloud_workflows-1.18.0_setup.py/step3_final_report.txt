  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'google-cloud-workflows', configuring metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'gapic_version.py' file, reads README file, and discovers packages via setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Version info extracted from local file; no external data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks: reading version info via regex, reading README, discovering packages, and setting dependencies. All operations are static and standard. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The regex-based version extraction assumes the version file is trusted. Dependencies are explicitly constrained. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with common package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the critical reports are appropriate. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the low risk score (around 0.1) is justified given the minimal residual risk associated with reading local files. Overall, the package setup is safe and trustworthy.",
