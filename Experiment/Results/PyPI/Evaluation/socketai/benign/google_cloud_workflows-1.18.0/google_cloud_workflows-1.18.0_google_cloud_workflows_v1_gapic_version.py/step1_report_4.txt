  "purpose": "The code appears to be a metadata header for a Python package, indicating licensing, copyright, version information, and encoding.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; no input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data movement present.",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the copyright year '2025', which is in the future relative to the knowledge cutoff in 2023. However, this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely metadata, licensing information, and a version variable declaration. There are no functions, data handling, or control flow statements. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code; the file's structure and content are standard for a Python package header.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package header containing licensing and version info with no malicious or suspicious content. It does not perform any operations or contain security risks.",
