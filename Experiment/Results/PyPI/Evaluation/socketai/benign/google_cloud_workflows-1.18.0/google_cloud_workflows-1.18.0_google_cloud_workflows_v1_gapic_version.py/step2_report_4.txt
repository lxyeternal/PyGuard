  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The report states that the code is purely metadata with no malicious activity, and the copyright year 2025 is noted as future but not suspicious.\n- Confirmed: The code is only comments and a version variable assignment. No executable logic, data flow, or malicious patterns.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n- No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, it identifies the code as a standard license header with no suspicious activity.\n- Confirmed: The code is just comments and a version string.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are appropriate.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion: metadata with no executable code, no data flow, no anomalies.\n- Confirmed: benign boilerplate code.\n- Scores: all zeroes are appropriate.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Notes the future copyright year '2025' as an anomaly but not malicious.\n- Confirmed: no executable code, just comments and version string.\n- Scores: all zeroes are appropriate.\n- No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, standard license header, no suspicious activity.\n- Confirmed: purely metadata.\n- Scores: all zeroes are appropriate.\n- No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is only metadata with no executable or malicious content.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None detected; the analysis in each report is accurate.\n- **Scores:** All are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Risk justification:** Since there's no executable logic, no data flow, no suspicious patterns, and no malware activity, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n- **Malware and obfuscation:** Correctly identified as absent.\n\n### Final recommendation:\nBased on the review, I agree with all the given assessments. The code snippet is entirely benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security risks.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and thorough. No changes needed.",
