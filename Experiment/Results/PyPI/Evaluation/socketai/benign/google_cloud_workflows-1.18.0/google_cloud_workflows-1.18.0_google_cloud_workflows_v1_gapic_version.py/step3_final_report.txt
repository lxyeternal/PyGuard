{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a metadata header containing licensing information, copyright notice, and versioning details for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from license comments, copyright statements, and the version variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as the code contains only static comments and a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the future copyright year '2025', which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely metadata with no executable logic, data processing, or dynamic code. It contains only comments and a version variable. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The license comments and version string are standard boilerplate. The future copyright year is likely a placeholder or typo but does not impact security. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only metadata information. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
