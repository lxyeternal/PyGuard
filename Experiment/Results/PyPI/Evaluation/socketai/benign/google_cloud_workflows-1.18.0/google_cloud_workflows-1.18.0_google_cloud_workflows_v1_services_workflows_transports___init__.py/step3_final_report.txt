{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a registry of transport classes for a client SDK, importing various transport implementations and exposing them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions imported from local modules; no external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not process untrusted input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and exposes them via __all__, with no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the license year '2025' in the comments, which is in the future and likely a placeholder or typo; no malicious or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports transport classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data. The license year being in the future is an anomaly but not indicative of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The reasoning across all reports is accurate and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup module for registering transport classes in an SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and accurate.",
