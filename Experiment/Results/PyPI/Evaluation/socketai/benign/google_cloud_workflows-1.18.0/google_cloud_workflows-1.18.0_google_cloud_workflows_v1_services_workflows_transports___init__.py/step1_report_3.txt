{
  "purpose": "Define and register transport classes for workflows, supporting multiple communication protocols.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest). The import statements are the primary data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks are present; no untrusted data is output or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "Imports and class registration flow from module imports to the _transport_registry dictionary initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, initializes a registry for different transport classes, and exposes certain classes via __all__. There are no indications of data leakage, malicious code, or security issues. It appears to be a straightforward module setup for transport registration, following standard Python practices without dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module for registering transport classes with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It functions solely to organize and expose transport class references.",
