{
  "purpose": "This code defines a registry of transport classes for a workflows module, facilitating different communication protocols.",
  "sources": "Imports from .base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, and .rest modules; hardcoded transport registry entries.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no output or network actions.",
  "flows": "Imports lead to registry creation, with registry entries stored in an ordered dictionary for later use.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific transport classes and registers them in an ordered dictionary for selection based on protocol. No external data input, no dynamic code execution, and no network or system manipulation. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module for managing transport classes in a client library. It contains no malicious behavior, no backdoors, and no security issues. It is safe and typical of an SDK or client library setup.",
