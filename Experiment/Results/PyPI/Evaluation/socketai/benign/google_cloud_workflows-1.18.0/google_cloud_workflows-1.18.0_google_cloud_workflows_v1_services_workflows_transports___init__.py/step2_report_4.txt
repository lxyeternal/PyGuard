  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a simple setup module that imports transport classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- There are no input/output operations, no network calls, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n- The license year (2025) is in the future, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- The code appears to be part of a client SDK infrastructure, facilitating transport protocol selection.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation:**\n- All reports correctly identify no obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n\n**Security Risk:**\n- No evidence of security risks, data leaks, or vulnerabilities. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n\n**Scores:**\n- The reports uniformly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n- These are appropriate given the code content.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n- The only minor anomaly is the license year 2025, which is in the future. This could be a typo or placeholder, but it doesn't impact security.\n- No dynamic or malicious behavior is present or implied.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, standard SDK setup code.\n- No changes needed to the scores; they are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:** All evidence points to this being a straightforward, safe module for registering transport classes in a client SDK.",
