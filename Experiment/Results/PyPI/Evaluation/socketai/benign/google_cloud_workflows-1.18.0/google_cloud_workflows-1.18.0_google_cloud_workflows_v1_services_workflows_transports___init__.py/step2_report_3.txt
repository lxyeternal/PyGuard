  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code imports transport classes from local modules.\n- It registers these classes in an `OrderedDict` under string keys.\n- It exposes the classes via `__all__`.\n- The code is purely for configuration/setup, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct, with no evident runtime errors or vulnerabilities.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Security risks:** No input/output of untrusted data, no secrets hardcoded, no network connections, no dynamic code execution.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The only unusual aspect is the license year \"2025\" in the comments, which is in the future relative to the current date (October 2023). This is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- No other logical flaws or security concerns are evident.\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the analysis that the code is benign.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The code is a static registry setup, with no runtime data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent or security vulnerability.\n- The consistent scoring across reports is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The reports correctly identify that this code is benign and standard.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the reasoning is sound.\n- The license year anomaly does not impact security but could be corrected for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a simple, benign SDK setup module.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is safe, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
