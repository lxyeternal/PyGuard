{
  "purpose": "This code defines and registers transport classes for a workflow-related module, allowing selection of different communication methods (gRPC, REST) for a client library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest) and a dictionary initialization.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks; the code mainly sets up class references.",
  "flows": "Import statements and registry setup flow, but no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual logic. The license year (2025) is in the future, but this does not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard module setup that imports necessary transport classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and exposes them via __all__. No input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, nor external network connections are present. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration module for a client SDK.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply sets up transport class registration for a client library, with no suspicious or harmful actions detected.",
