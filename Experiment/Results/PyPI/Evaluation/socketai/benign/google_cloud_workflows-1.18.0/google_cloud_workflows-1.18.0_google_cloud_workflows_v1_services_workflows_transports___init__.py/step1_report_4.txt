{
  "purpose": "Defines and registers transport classes for the Workflows API in a Python client library.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes, and defines a registry dictionary for transport classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network, file operations, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; code only defines classes and a registry without data flow or external input/output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and types, then creates a registry dictionary mapping string keys to transport classes. The license is open-source, and there is no evidence of data collection, external network connections, or malicious logic. It appears to be a standard component of a Python client SDK, with no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup for transport class registration in a client SDK. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is benign and appears to be part of normal SDK infrastructure.",
