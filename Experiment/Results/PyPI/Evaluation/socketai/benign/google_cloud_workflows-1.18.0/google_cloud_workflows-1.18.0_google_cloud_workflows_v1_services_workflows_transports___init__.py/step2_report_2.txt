  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is a straightforward, benign setup for registering transport classes.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code only imports modules, registers classes in a dictionary, and exposes them via `__all__`.\n- No data flows involve untrusted input, external network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- The license year (2025) is in the future, which is unusual but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly identifies the code's purpose.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious behavior, straightforward registry setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No security issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & sources:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- The code is a standard setup module with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score is appropriately 0, given the lack of any security issues.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional note:** The future license year (2025) is unusual but not malicious. It might be a typo or a placeholder, but it does not impact security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. I agree with the current scores.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code appears to be a standard, safe component of an SDK setup.",
