  "purpose": "This code is a Google Cloud SDK client for managing and executing Workflows, handling environment variables, credentials, and API requests.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for configuration, method parameters for request data, and SDK modules for API interactions.",
  "sinks": "API requests sent over transport layers; error details may include credential info for debugging.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, params) -> request objects -> transport layer -> API endpoints; error handling may append credential info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Credential info appended to error details is standard SDK debugging behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, auto-generated Google Cloud SDK client library for Workflows. It manages credentials securely, uses environment variables for configuration, and performs standard API request patterns. No signs of sabotage, obfuscation, or malicious activity are present. The credential info in error details, while potentially sensitive, is a common debugging feature and not malicious. The code structure is clear and consistent with open-source SDK practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious or sabotage indicators. The security risk is very low, primarily due to standard SDK debugging practices. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall risk score is approximately 0.1.",
