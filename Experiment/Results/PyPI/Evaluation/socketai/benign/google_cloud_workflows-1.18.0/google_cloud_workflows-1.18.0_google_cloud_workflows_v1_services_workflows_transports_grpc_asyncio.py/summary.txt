  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured, and aligns with typical SDK patterns. There is no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The minor concern about pickle in logs is a standard debugging risk, not a malicious activity. Overall, the code is safe for use with proper log management."
