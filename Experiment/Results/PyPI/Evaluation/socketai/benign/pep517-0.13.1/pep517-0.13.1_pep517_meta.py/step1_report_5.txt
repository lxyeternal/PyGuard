{
  "purpose": "The code automates building package metadata and distributions for a Python project, including support for ZIP packaging and metadata extraction.",
  "sources": "User-supplied source directory via command-line argument, environment variables during pip installations, temporary files during build process.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (shutil.move, os.makedirs), subprocess execution via hooks, creating ZIP files, importing metadata modules.",
  "flows": "Source data (source_dir, environment, build requirements) -> build dependencies installed in environment -> metadata prepared in temporary directory -> moved to destination -> ZIP archive created from build output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of standard libraries and build hooks appears typical. The code properly manages temporary files and directories. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs structured build tasks typical for Python package preparation, utilizing build hooks, temporary directories, and ZIP packaging. It reads input paths, installs dependencies securely within an environment, and handles file operations safely. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The use of importlib.metadata, tempfile, shutil, and standard subprocess handling is normal for build scripts. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate build utility for Python packages. It manages dependencies, metadata, and packaging securely and transparently. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected.",
