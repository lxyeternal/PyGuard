  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Python build utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of external hooks, but within this code, no malicious activity is detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the potential attack surface due to external dependencies but consistent with safe, controlled build processes."
