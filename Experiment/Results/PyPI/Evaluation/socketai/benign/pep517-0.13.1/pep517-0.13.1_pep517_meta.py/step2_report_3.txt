  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasonableness of scores, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes standard build process, no anomalies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly identified; subprocesses and file operations are typical but could be exploited if external hooks are malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code appears legitimate, with dependency installation and build steps standard.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 — aligns with no malicious code.\n  - Security Risk: 0.3 — slightly elevated but justified given external hook reliance.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.\n  - Confidence: 0.8 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; standard build script with typical imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Well-identified; subprocesses and file moves are standard but depend on external hooks.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid; emphasizes external hooks as potential attack vectors but finds no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified.\n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — consistent with external dependency reliance.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.\n  - Confidence: 0.95 — high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes typical build orchestration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; subprocesses via hooks could be risky if compromised.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; emphasizes external hooks as potential risk points but finds no malicious code.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — justified.\n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — consistent.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.\n  - Confidence: 0.8.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no changes necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; standard build and packaging.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; subprocess calls and file operations are typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0.\n  - Security Risk: 0.2.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.\n  - Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; describes build process.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; subprocesses and ZIP packaging.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0.\n  - Security Risk: 0.2.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.\n  - Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, indicating no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2–0.3), justified by reliance on external hooks and subprocesses, which could be vectors if compromised, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the standard nature of the code and lack of malicious indicators, a conservative but justified risk score would be around **0.2** for all reports, aligning with their current assessments.\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The reports' scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n- The only potential concern is external hook integrity, which is acknowledged but does not warrant higher risk scores without further evidence.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.2 – 0.3      |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.2            |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.2            |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.2            |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.2            |\n\nAll are consistent and justified based on the provided code and analysis.",
