  "purpose": "Builds package metadata and distribution files for a Python project using PEP 517 hooks, optionally creating ZIP archives of the build.",
  "sources": "Reads input from command line arguments (`source_dir`, `--out-dir`), environment variables (via `os`, `os.path`), and internal function calls to build dependencies and metadata.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess runner (`quiet_subprocess_runner`), file operations (`shutil.move`, `os.makedirs`), and network installation commands (`env.pip_install`) which could potentially be misused if the dependencies or hooks execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Command line args -> `build()` function -> `load_system()` and `validate_system()` -> hooks to prepare metadata -> dependencies installed -> temporary files created -> `shutil.move()` used to move files -> optional ZIP creation of build artifacts -> final importlib.metadata integration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Use of `subprocess_runner` is controlled via `quiet_subprocess_runner`, but without insight into its implementation, risk cannot be fully assessed. No suspicious network activity or obfuscation is detected. Usage of `importlib.metadata` and package build procedures are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical build and packaging operations with reliance on external hooks and subprocess calls. It handles temporary directories safely with context managers, moves files explicitly, and uses standard Python packaging tools. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. The subprocess runner is a potential concern if it were malicious, but assuming standard or benign implementation, the code appears safe. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malware signatures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package build script utilizing PEP 517 hooks, with no apparent malicious intent. Risks are mainly associated with external hooks and subprocess calls, which depend on their own implementations. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
