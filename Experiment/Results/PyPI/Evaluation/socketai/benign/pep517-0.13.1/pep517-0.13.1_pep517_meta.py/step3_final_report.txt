  "purpose": "Build metadata for a Python project using PEP 517 hooks, involving dependency installation, metadata preparation, and packaging.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, filesystem, package metadata, external hooks, subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "pip_install, subprocess (hooks), shutil.move, importlib.metadata, file operations.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (environment, filesystem, hooks) to sinks like subprocesses and file moves, via build functions and hooks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected; reliance on external hooks could be a vector but no malicious activity evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build steps with controlled subprocess calls and external hooks. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External hooks and subprocesses are potential attack surfaces but are common in build systems and are controlled here. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are observed. The code's structure is straightforward, and the logic aligns with typical build scripts. The reliance on external hooks warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Python build utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of external hooks, but within this code, no malicious activity is detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the potential attack surface due to external dependencies but consistent with safe, controlled build processes.",
