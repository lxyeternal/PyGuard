The primary concern is the trustworthiness of external hooks, but within this code, no malicious activity is detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the potential attack surface due to external dependencies but consistent with safe, controlled build processes."

The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and low security risk (~0.2) are consistent with its functionality. It relies on external hooks, which could be a vector if untrusted, but the script itself is safe."

The current scores are appropriate; a slight increase in risk score to 0.2 could better reflect the dependency risk, but overall, the code is safe."

The primary security risk relates to potential command injection if external inputs are untrusted, but the code itself is benign. Scores are appropriately assigned: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3 depending on input trust. Ensuring input sanitization would mitigate potential exploitation risks."

The main security risk stems from external dependencies, not the code itself. Scores are appropriately low for malware and obfuscation; the security risk score reflects supply chain considerations. Ensuring dependencies are from trusted sources is recommended to mitigate external risks."

It does not contain malicious code but relies heavily on environment variables for module loading, which could be exploited if environment variables are manipulated. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be approximately 0.7 to reflect the potential for supply chain or environment-based attacks."
