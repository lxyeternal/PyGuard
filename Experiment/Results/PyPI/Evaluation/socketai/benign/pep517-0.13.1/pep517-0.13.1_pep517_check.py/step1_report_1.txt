  "purpose": "This script checks a Python project directory for build integrity by attempting to build source distributions and wheels using PEP 517 hooks, ensuring proper setup and file outputs.",
  "sources": "Reads the source directory for 'pyproject.toml', loads configuration data; uses hooks to retrieve build requirements and perform builds; reads files for 'pyproject.toml'.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes untrusted data or executes untrusted code; uses subprocess calls internally through build environment and pip installation, but these are encapsulated within safe abstractions.",
  "flows": "Loads configuration from 'pyproject.toml' -> Uses hooks to get build requirements -> Installs dependencies -> Builds sdist/wheel -> Checks output files and formats.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'sys.stdout.isatty()' for output styling; reliance on external hooks and build environment; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build validation by loading project configuration, installing dependencies, and building distribution files. It uses standard Python modules and well-known patterns. No signs of malicious behavior such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The only external interactions are via pip and build hooks, which are expected for build validation. The use of 'sys.stdout.isatty()' for output formatting is benign. The process of installing build dependencies and creating build artifacts is typical and appears secure, assuming the build environment and hooks are trustworthy. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard project build validator script that loads configuration, installs dependencies, and verifies build artifacts. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leakage. It operates within expected boundaries of a build validation tool. The risk of malicious intent is very low.",
