  "purpose": "This script validates the build process of a Python project by attempting to create source and wheel distributions using PEP 517 hooks, ensuring the output files are correctly generated and formatted.",
  "sources": "Reads 'pyproject.toml' for build configuration, installs dependencies via pip, and invokes build hooks to generate distributions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that lead to data exfiltration or malicious actions; primarily filesystem operations and dependency installations.",
  "flows": "Loads configuration -> installs build requirements -> invokes build hooks -> verifies output files and formats.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Relies on external build hooks, which could execute arbitrary code if untrusted, but this is standard for build systems.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build validation tasks: loading configuration, installing dependencies, invoking build hooks, and verifying output files. It handles errors appropriately and uses common modules. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or network activity are present. The reliance on external hooks is typical but could pose a risk if hooks are malicious, though this is outside the scope of the script itself.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard build validation utility with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and low security risk (~0.2) are consistent with its functionality. It relies on external hooks, which could be a vector if untrusted, but the script itself is safe.",
