{
  "purpose": "The script performs a security and integrity check of a Python project by attempting to build source and wheel distributions using PEP 517 hooks, validating build outputs, and ensuring the correctness of the pyproject.toml configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads pyproject.toml file, calls build hook methods (get_requires_for_build_sdist, build_sdist, get_requires_for_build_wheel, build_wheel), and uses environment variables during pip installation and build processes.",
  "sinks": "Executes pip install commands, calls build hook functions, creates temporary directories for building distributions, and reads files from the filesystem.",
  "flows": "Reads configuration from pyproject.toml → Installs dependencies via pip → Calls build hooks to obtain requirements → Builds sdist and wheel files → Validates output files and formats.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unconventional language features; uses standard Python libraries and third-party modules in typical ways; no network communications or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build and validation steps for Python packaging, including dependency installation, invoking build hooks, and verifying output files' existence and formats. It uses standard libraries such as tarfile and zipfile to validate artifacts. No suspicious or malicious activities, such as network communication, data leakage, or backdoors, are present. The code's purpose appears to be legitimate package validation. All operations are related to package build verification, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate package build validation tool that performs checks on a Python project's build process and output artifacts. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It adheres to standard practices and does not include any suspicious code or network activity.",
