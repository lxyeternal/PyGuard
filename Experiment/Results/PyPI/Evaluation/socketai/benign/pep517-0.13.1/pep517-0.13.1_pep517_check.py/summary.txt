  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard build validation utility with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and low security risk (~0.2) are consistent with its functionality. It relies on external hooks, which could be a vector if untrusted, but the script itself is safe."
