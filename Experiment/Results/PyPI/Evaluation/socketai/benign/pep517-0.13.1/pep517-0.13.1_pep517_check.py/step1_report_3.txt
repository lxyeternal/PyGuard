{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to verify the build process of a Python project by checking the ability to build sdist and wheel distributions using PEP 517 hooks, ensuring dependencies and build outputs are correct.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'pyproject.toml' file, environment variables during pip installation, and build commands through hooks (build_sdist and build_wheel).",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocesses via hooks to build distributions, writes temporary files/directories, and reads configuration data from 'pyproject.toml'.",
  "flows": "Loads configuration from 'pyproject.toml' -> installs dependencies -> invokes build hooks -> verifies output files -> cleans up temporary files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code. The code relies on external hooks for building, which are expected to be safe. Use of 'sys.stdout.isatty()' for terminal detection is standard. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs build validation by loading 'pyproject.toml', extracting build system requirements, and invoking build hooks to generate source and wheel distributions. It installs required dependencies in a temporary environment, performs build operations, and verifies output files' existence and types. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity. The only potential concern is that the build hooks could be implemented maliciously if provided by untrusted sources, but within this code, there is no direct malicious behavior. It uses standard library functions and safe subprocess practices. The code functions solely to validate build processes without performing any hidden or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a build verification utility that relies on external hooks for building distributions. It performs standard operations with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The implementation appears safe and intended for legitimate build validation tasks.",
