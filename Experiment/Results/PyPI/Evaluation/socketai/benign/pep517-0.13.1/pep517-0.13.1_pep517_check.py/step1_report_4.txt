  "purpose": "This script automates the process of building and verifying Python packages using PEP 517 hooks, including building source distributions and wheels, and validating build requirements and output files.",
  "sources": "Reads 'pyproject.toml' file, data from hooks methods ('get_requires_for_build_sdist', 'get_requires_for_build_wheel', 'build_sdist', 'build_wheel'), and environment variables during pip installations.",
  "sinks": "Execution of build commands via hooks, file creation of tar.gz and whl files, pip installation commands, and reading from configuration files.",
  "flows": "Reads configuration data from 'pyproject.toml' -> calls build hook methods to get dependencies and build artifacts -> installs dependencies via pip -> executes build commands -> verifies output files.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic execution of build hooks which could execute arbitrary code, but this is standard for build systems. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity observed. Logging includes exceptions and error info, but does not log sensitive data. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly manages the build process for Python packages, invoking standard build hooks, installing dependencies, and verifying output files. It does not perform network operations beyond pip installs, nor does it execute any command outside the standard build workflow. There are no hardcoded credentials, no malicious system modifications, and no suspicious file or data handling. The use of environment and build hooks aligns with typical build validation procedures, and the code is straightforward and well-structured. The only notable aspect is reliance on third-party build hooks, which could execute arbitrary code if malicious, but this is inherent to build systems and not specific to malicious intent here.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a build validator for Python projects using PEP 517, with no signs of malicious intent. It performs expected operations such as dependency installation, build invocation, and output verification. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The script is standard for its purpose, with no indicators of malicious activity or security risks.",
