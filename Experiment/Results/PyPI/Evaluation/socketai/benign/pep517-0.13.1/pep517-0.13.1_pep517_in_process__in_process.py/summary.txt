  "conclusion": "The script is a controlled plugin loader that executes build hooks based on external inputs. It does not contain malicious code but relies heavily on environment variables for module loading, which could be exploited if environment variables are manipulated. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be approximately 0.7 to reflect the potential for supply chain or environment-based attacks."
