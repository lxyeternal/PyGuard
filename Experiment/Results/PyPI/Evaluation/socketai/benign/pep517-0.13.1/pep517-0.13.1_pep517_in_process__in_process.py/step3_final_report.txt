  "purpose": "This script functions as a plugin orchestrator, dynamically loading build backend hooks based on environment variables and JSON input, and executing corresponding functions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PEP517_BUILD_BACKEND, PEP517_BACKEND_PATH), control_dir/input.json",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import_module calls, hook function invocations, JSON output files",
  "flows": "Environment variables and input JSON data flow into import_module and hook functions, with results written to output.json",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to determine module import paths and module names, potential fallback mechanisms, no input validation for imported modules",
  "analysis": "The code relies on environment variables to determine which backend module to load and execute hooks. It performs dynamic imports and calls functions that may originate from external, potentially untrusted sources. No malicious code or obfuscation is present within the script itself. The primary security concern is the potential for supply chain attacks if environment variables are manipulated to load malicious modules. The code's structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. The use of dynamic import and reflection introduces an attack surface where malicious modules could be loaded and executed if environment control is compromised. The malware score is therefore low, but the security risk score should be higher due to the potential for malicious module loading via environment variables.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a controlled plugin loader that executes build hooks based on external inputs. It does not contain malicious code but relies heavily on environment variables for module loading, which could be exploited if environment variables are manipulated. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be approximately 0.7 to reflect the potential for supply chain or environment-based attacks.",
