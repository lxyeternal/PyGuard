  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for creating an in-memory ZIP archive from a directory. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) is appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
