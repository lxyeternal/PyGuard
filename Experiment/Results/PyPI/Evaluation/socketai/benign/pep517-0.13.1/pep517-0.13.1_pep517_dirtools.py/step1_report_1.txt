  "purpose": "Constructs an in-memory ZIP archive from a directory specified by the root path.",
  "sources": "Reads directory structure and files from the specified root directory using os.walk.",
  "sinks": "Writes ZIP entries to an in-memory buffer via zipfile.ZipFile; no external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reads directory data from os.walk -> writes ZIP entries into in-memory buffer via zipfile.ZipFile.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Uses standard library functions appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code walks through the directory structure at the provided root path, adding directories and files into a zip archive stored in memory. It uses io.BytesIO to create an in-memory buffer and zipfile.ZipFile to write ZIP entries. The code appears to perform a straightforward directory-to-zip conversion without any obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. No external data transmission, credential handling, or secret leaks are evident. The logic is standard and does not involve any hidden or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function that creates an in-memory ZIP archive of a directory. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
