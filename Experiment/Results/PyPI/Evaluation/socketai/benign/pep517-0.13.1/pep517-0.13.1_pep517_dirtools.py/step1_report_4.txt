{
  "purpose": "Create an in-memory zip archive from a specified directory.",
  "sources": "os.walk() for directory traversal, reading directory and file paths",
  "sinks": "zipfile.ZipFile.writestr() and zipfile.ZipFile.write() for writing data to the zip archive",
  "flows": "os.walk() generates directory and file paths -> rel_path computations -> zipfile write operations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present; use of standard library functions without obfuscation or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that traverses a directory structure using os.walk(). It writes directories as empty entries and files into an in-memory zip archive via io.BytesIO(). The implementation appears straightforward, using standard library calls with no obfuscated or suspicious logic. No data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoor code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code reliably converts a directory into an in-memory zip file with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs a typical task of directory archiving in memory, suitable for packaging or transfer purposes.",
