{
  "purpose": "Provides a custom logging formatter with optional terminal color support to enhance log readability.",
  "sources": "The code reads terminal capabilities via the curses module to determine color support.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks are present; the code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The code checks terminal capabilities (source) to determine color codes (sink) used in formatting log messages (flow).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, copied from Tornado, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, open-source utility for colored log formatting. It uses standard modules and practices, with no malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. It performs only aesthetic enhancements without external data handling or network activity. The use of curses is appropriate and handled gracefully if unavailable. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation for log formatting with color support. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, which are consistent with the analysis.",
