  "purpose": "The code provides a custom logging formatter with optional color support for terminal output, improving log readability.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it primarily sets up logging and checks terminal capabilities.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform data leakage, network communication, or other malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard implementation copied from an external source with no hidden or unusual behavior; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom logging formatter that adds color support if the terminal supports it. It conditionally imports curses, checks terminal capabilities, and formats log messages with optional colors. It includes a function to enable colorful output. No input sources or sinks are present; the code is purely for aesthetic log formatting. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, no network or data exfiltration activities, and no hardcoded credentials. The code is well-structured, with comments explaining functionality, and performs no actions beyond logging setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, aesthetic enhancement for logging with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard utility copied from an open-source project, with no hidden malicious intent.",
