  "purpose": "Provides wrappers to build Python packages using PEP 517 hooks",
  "sources": "Imports all functions and classes from the .wrappers module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only an import statement",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and imports everything from a local module named .wrappers. There are no input handling, network operations, or suspicious patterns. The import statement is standard, and the code appears to be part of a packaging utility. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign code serving as an entry point for package building utilities. No malicious behavior detected.",
