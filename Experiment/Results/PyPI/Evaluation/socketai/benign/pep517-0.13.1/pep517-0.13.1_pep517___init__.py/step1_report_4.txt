{
  "purpose": "Provides wrappers to build Python packages using PEP 517 hooks.",
  "sources": "The code imports everything from the '.wrappers' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "The import statement could lead to execution of code within the 'wrappers' module when imported.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure which functions or code are executed, potentially hiding malicious code in the imported module.",
  "analysis": "The code itself is minimal, mainly defining a version string and importing a module. The import statement 'from .wrappers import *' can execute arbitrary code from the 'wrappers' module upon import, which is a potential risk if the module contains malicious code. However, the current file contains no direct malicious behavior or obfuscated code. The risk depends on the content of the 'wrappers' module, which is not provided. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident here.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple wrapper interface with minimal logic. The only potential concern is the import of the 'wrappers' module, which could contain malicious code. Based solely on this file, there are no indications of malicious intent, but reliance on the external module's integrity is necessary.",
