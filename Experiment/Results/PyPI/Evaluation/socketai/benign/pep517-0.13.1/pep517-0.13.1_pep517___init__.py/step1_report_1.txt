  "purpose": "To provide wrappers for building Python packages using PEP 517 hooks.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .wrappers module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or effects.",
  "flows": "Import from local module, which could potentially execute code upon import if the module has side effects.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .wrappers import *' could import unintended or malicious code if the module is compromised, but this is a common pattern in package initialization. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and imports everything from a local 'wrappers' module. The import statement could be risky if the 'wrappers' module contains malicious code, but in typical package setup, this is standard practice. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hidden malicious functions, or suspicious behavior. The file is minimal and straightforward, serving as an entry point or initializer for package building functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package wrapper for PEP 517 build hooks. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this fragment. It is a benign module with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
