  "sources": "The import statement 'from .wrappers import *' which loads code from the local 'wrappers' module",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of code within the 'wrappers' module if it contains malicious code",
  "flows": "Importing 'wrappers' module upon execution, which could execute malicious code if present",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' from a local module; minimal code with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, defining a version string and importing all from a local module. No malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The main concern is that the import could execute malicious code if the 'wrappers' module is compromised. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate. The risk score is low (0.1-0.2), reflecting reliance on external code. Confidence in benign nature is high, but the potential risk depends on the integrity of the 'wrappers' module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of the 'wrappers' module. The current scores are appropriate; a slight increase in risk score to 0.2 could better reflect the dependency risk, but overall, the code is safe.",
