{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a wrapper module to facilitate building Python packages using PEP 517 hooks, providing versioning and importing wrapper functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own version string and imports all definitions from the 'wrappers' submodule.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform external system actions.",
  "flows": "The code does not process or pass untrusted data; it simply sets a version and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code appears straightforward and adheres to common package practices.",
  "analysis": "The module defines a version string and imports everything from a local submodule 'wrappers'. The import statement could potentially load code that might contain malicious or unintended behavior, but without inspecting 'wrappers', no malicious intent can be determined. There are no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no unusual constructs. The code is minimal and standard for Python package setup wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard and does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on the provided snippet. The import statement warrants a review of the 'wrappers' module for completeness, but within this scope, no malicious activity is detected.",
