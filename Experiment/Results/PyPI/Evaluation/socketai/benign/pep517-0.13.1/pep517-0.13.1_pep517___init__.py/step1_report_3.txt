{
  "purpose": "This code provides wrappers to build Python packages using PEP 517 hooks, likely serving as part of a build system or package management tool.",
  "sources": "The only source is the import statement 'from .wrappers import *', which loads code from a local module named 'wrappers'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling points in the provided code.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable data flows from sources to sinks, as the code solely imports a module without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' from a local module is generally discouraged due to obscurity, but it is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a version declaration, a comment, and a single import statement from a local module. There are no inputs, outputs, or operations that could indicate malicious activity. The import statement could potentially load malicious code if the local 'wrappers' module is compromised, but based solely on this code, there is no evidence of malicious intent. The code appears to be a typical initialization file for a package component.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It merely defines a version and imports a module. Without additional context about the 'wrappers' module, there is no indication of malicious activity.",
