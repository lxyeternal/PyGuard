  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Code Overview:**\n```python\n\"\"\"Wrappers to build Python packages using PEP 517 hooks\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = '0.13.1'\n\nfrom .wrappers import *  # noqa: F401, F403\n```\n\nThis is a minimal module primarily serving as an entry point or initializer, setting a version and importing all contents from a local 'wrappers' module.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation; standard practice.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate. The import statement is typical but could be risky if the 'wrappers' module is compromised, which is acknowledged. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; benign code.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Similar, with a note on 'import *' being discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. The import pattern is standard but warrants caution, which is correctly reflected.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Highlights the potential risk of executing malicious code via 'import *' but notes no evidence of malicious code here.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.2\n\n**Justification:** The main concern is the import of the 'wrappers' module, which could contain malicious code. Since the code itself does not include malicious logic, the malware score remains 0. The security risk is higher due to reliance on external code, which is correctly acknowledged.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others; standard pattern.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Evaluation & Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code in this snippet.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Generally low, with some acknowledgment that importing potentially compromised modules could pose a risk. The scores are reasonable.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The main potential security concern lies in the 'wrappers' module being compromised or malicious. Since this code imports everything from that module, its integrity is critical.\n- The 'import *' pattern, while common in package init files, can hide malicious code if the imported module is compromised.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n- The code itself is benign; the primary concern is external module integrity.\n- The risk scores could be slightly increased if more context about the 'wrappers' module is available, but based solely on this snippet, current scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0.1–0.2** |\n\nGiven the cautious approach, I would set:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.15 (reflecting the dependency on external code integrity)\n\n**Summary:** The code is straightforward, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The main concern is external module trustworthiness, which is acknowledged but not reflected as a direct risk in this snippet. The current scores are reasonable and justified.",
