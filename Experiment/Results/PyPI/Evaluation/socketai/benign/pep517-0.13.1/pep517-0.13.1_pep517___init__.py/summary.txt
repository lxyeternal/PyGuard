  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of the 'wrappers' module. The current scores are appropriate; a slight increase in risk score to 0.2 could better reflect the dependency risk, but overall, the code is safe."
