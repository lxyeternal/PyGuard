  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Issue Presence in Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code performs a straightforward version check to import 'tomllib' or 'tomli' accordingly. There are no hidden behaviors or anomalies. The code is standard and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their reasoning. They correctly interpret the purpose, sources, and flows. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Confidence: 1 (high confidence, justified)\n   - Obfuscated: 0 (correct, code is clear)\n   - Malware: 0 (correct, no malicious behavior)\n   - SecurityRisk: 0 (appropriate, no risks identified)\n\n   These scores seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since all evidence points to benign, standard compatibility code, there's no reason to assign a risk score higher than 0.5. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated/malicious code.\n\n5. **Malware Score**:  \n   The malware score is correctly 0 across all reports. The code is a simple version check and import statement, with no malicious intent.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions. They correctly state that the code is a compatibility shim with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (no security risk)\n\n### Justification:\nThe code is a standard version compatibility pattern. It uses well-understood, safe practices to import modules based on Python version. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- The code is benign and standard.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate.  \n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0**, **obfuscated = 0**, **securityRisk = 0**.",
