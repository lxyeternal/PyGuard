{
  "purpose": "Conditional import of the 'tomllib' module depending on Python version, with fallback to 'tomli'.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info (reads version information from sys module).",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; code does not process untrusted data or perform risky operations.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → import decision → import of 'tomllib' or 'tomli'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code follows standard pattern for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an __all__ attribute to expose 'tomllib'. It then checks the Python version using sys.version_info. If the version is >= 3.11, it imports 'tomllib' (standard library). Otherwise, it imports 'tomli' and assigns it to 'tomllib' for compatibility. This pattern is common for maintaining compatibility across Python versions. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward compatibility layer for importing 'tomllib' across different Python versions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
