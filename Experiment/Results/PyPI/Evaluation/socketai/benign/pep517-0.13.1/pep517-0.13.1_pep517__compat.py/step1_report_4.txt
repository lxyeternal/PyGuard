  "purpose": "Conditional import of the 'tomllib' module based on Python version, to support reading TOML files.",
  "sources": "Reading Python version information via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data usage observed.",
  "flows": "Python version info flows from sys.version_info to determine which module to import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard version checking and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an '__all__' list to specify 'tomllib' as the public API. It then imports the 'sys' module to access Python version information. Depending on whether the Python version is 3.11 or higher, it imports 'tomllib' directly; otherwise, it imports 'tomli' as 'tomllib'. This pattern is a common compatibility approach for using 'tomllib' in earlier Python versions by aliasing 'tomli'. All operations are straightforward and rely on standard library features or well-known third-party modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard version check and conditional import to maintain compatibility across Python versions. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security issues are present.",
