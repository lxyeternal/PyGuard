{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports the 'tomllib' module for parsing TOML files, choosing the appropriate implementation based on the Python version.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for version checking, import statements for 'tomllib' or 'tomli' based on the version",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data processing or external communication",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only manages imports based on environment",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward conditional import without obfuscation or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code sets '__all__' to expose 'tomllib'. It then checks Python version; if >= 3.11, imports the built-in 'tomllib', otherwise imports 'tomli' as 'tomllib'. This is a standard pattern for maintaining compatibility across Python versions. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leakage. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version-compatible import setup for the 'tomllib' module, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
