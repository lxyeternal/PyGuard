{
  "purpose": "To provide compatibility for importing 'tomllib' in Python 3.11+ or 'tomli' in earlier versions, ensuring consistent module availability across Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version info via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "The source (sys.version_info) influences the import statement, but there are no data flows beyond conditional import logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple version check to conditionally import modules, a common compatibility pattern. It uses standard Python practices without obfuscation or malicious intent. No data leaks, network activity, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard compatibility shim with no security issues or malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
