  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a standard version compatibility shim that conditionally imports `tomllib` in Python 3.11+ or `tomli` otherwise.\n- The logic is straightforward, well-understood, and commonly used.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated behavior is reported or evident.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain any backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and performs a standard compatibility check.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  No. The reasoning is consistent, accurate, and aligns with standard Python practices.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty.\n\n- **Scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  No. All are 0, which is justified.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  The code does not perform any malicious actions. The malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they simply describe the code's behavior.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report?**  \n  Yes. The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Additional critical evaluation:\n\n- **Is there any hidden malicious intent or backdoor?**  \n  No. The code is a common pattern for compatibility.\n\n- **Is there obfuscation?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward.\n\n- **Are there any vulnerabilities?**  \n  No. The code does not process untrusted data or perform risky operations.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the uniformity of the reports and the code, and considering the detailed analysis, **the current scores are accurate and justified**.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard compatibility pattern with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this code is safe, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores. The code poses no security risk.",
