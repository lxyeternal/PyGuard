{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically imports the 'tomllib' module based on the Python version, choosing between the standard library in Python 3.11+ and an external 'tomli' package in earlier versions.",
  "sources": "The import statements, which read the system's Python version information via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "The import operations themselves do not act as sinks for untrusted data; they are static imports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The code only reads the Python version info to determine which module to import.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a version check and conditionally imports modules, which is standard. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python runtime version and imports 'tomllib' from the standard library if available (Python 3.11+). Otherwise, it imports 'tomli' as 'tomllib'. This is a common compatibility pattern. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data leaks, and no malicious behavior or obfuscation present. The code is straightforward and purposefully designed for compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign compatibility layer for importing 'tomllib' across different Python versions. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks identified.",
