{
  "purpose": "This code dynamically imports the 'tomllib' module, which is used for parsing TOML files, based on the Python version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version information from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The source (sys.version_info) influences which module is imported as 'tomllib'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The import logic is standard for compatibility between Python versions.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if the Python version is 3.11 or newer. If so, it imports the built-in 'tomllib' module. Otherwise, it imports 'tomli' and assigns it to 'tomllib'. This approach ensures compatibility across different Python versions. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior is present. The code's structure and purpose are straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version compatibility shim for importing 'tomllib' in Python. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks.",
