  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard utility for building Python packages, free of malware or obfuscation. The main security risk stems from external dependencies, not the code itself. Scores are appropriately low for malware and obfuscation; the security risk score reflects supply chain considerations. Ensuring dependencies are from trusted sources is recommended to mitigate external risks."
