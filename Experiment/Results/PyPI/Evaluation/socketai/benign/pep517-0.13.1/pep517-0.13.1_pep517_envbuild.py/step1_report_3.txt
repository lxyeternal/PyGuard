{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to facilitate building Python package wheels and source distributions using PEP 517 hooks, by creating a temporary isolated environment and installing build dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'pyproject.toml' to load build requirements, environment variable access and modification, subprocess calls to pip for dependency installation, file system operations for temporary directories.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to pip for installing dependencies, environment variable modifications (PATH and PYTHONPATH), file system deletions (shutil.rmtree), opening and reading files (pyproject.toml).",
  "flows": "Code loads dependencies from pyproject.toml -> sets environment variables -> calls pip via subprocess to install requirements -> builds wheel or sdist using hooks -> cleans up temporary environment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no malicious system commands or network connections present. Usage of subprocess to call pip could be a concern if untrusted input influenced 'reqs' or 'config_settings', but the code does not show such input sources. No hidden backdoors or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate build operations for Python packages, creating a temporary environment and installing specified dependencies. It reads 'pyproject.toml' safely and uses subprocess to invoke pip, which is standard. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or system damage routines are present. The environment variable modifications are standard for isolated builds. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate build utility for Python packages, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It follows common patterns for isolated builds and dependency management. The security risk is low, assuming the source and dependencies are trusted.",
