{
  "purpose": "This code manages building Python wheels and sdist packages using PEP 517 hooks, setting up isolated build environments, and installing build dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'pyproject.toml' file; environment variables (PATH, PYTHONPATH); subprocess calls to pip for package installation.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to pip (installing dependencies); environment modifications (PATH, PYTHONPATH); potential file system modifications during environment cleanup.",
  "flows": "Reading 'pyproject.toml' -> setting environment variables -> installing build requirements via pip -> executing build hooks -> building wheel or sdist files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Environment variables are temporarily modified but correctly restored; subprocess calls are standard for dependency installation; no suspicious network activity or file manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a temporary build environment to install dependencies specified in 'pyproject.toml', then runs build hooks to generate distributions. It correctly manages environment variables and cleans up after itself. Use of subprocess to invoke pip is standard; no malicious commands or network activity are present. No unusual or malicious code patterns detected; all operations are typical for a build system. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs typical, legitimate build operations for Python packages using PEP 517. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. It appears safe and purpose-driven for package building tasks.",
