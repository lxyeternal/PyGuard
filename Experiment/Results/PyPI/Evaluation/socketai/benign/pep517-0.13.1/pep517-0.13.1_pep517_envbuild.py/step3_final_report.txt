{
  "purpose": "This code facilitates building Python distribution packages (wheels and sdist) using PEP 517 hooks, by creating an isolated environment, installing build dependencies, and invoking build processes.",
  "sources": "Reads 'pyproject.toml' for build requirements; installs dependencies via subprocess calls to pip; uses build hooks for packaging.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to pip can execute untrusted code if dependencies are malicious; environment variables are temporarily modified but restored afterward.",
  "flows": "Reads build requirements from 'pyproject.toml' -> installs dependencies via pip -> invokes build hooks -> generates package distributions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or network activity; environment management is proper; relies on external dependencies which could be compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package build operations, managing environment variables and dependencies securely. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of external dependencies specified in 'pyproject.toml' and build hooks, which could be malicious if compromised. The subprocess calls to pip are typical but should be used with trusted dependencies. The code itself is straightforward and well-structured, with no logical flaws or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, standard utility for building Python packages, free of malware or obfuscation. The main security risk stems from external dependencies, not the code itself. Scores are appropriately low for malware and obfuscation; the security risk score reflects supply chain considerations. Ensuring dependencies are from trusted sources is recommended to mitigate external risks.",
