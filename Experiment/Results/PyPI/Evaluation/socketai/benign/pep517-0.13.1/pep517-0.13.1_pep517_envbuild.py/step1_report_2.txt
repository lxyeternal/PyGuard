{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions and classes to build Python wheels and source distributions (sdists) using PEP 517 build hooks, managing dependencies in a temporary environment.",
  "sources": "Reads 'pyproject.toml' file in '_load_pyproject'; environment variables 'PATH' and 'PYTHONPATH'; subprocess calls via 'check_call' for pip installations.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to pip for installing dependencies; modification of environment variables 'PATH' and 'PYTHONPATH'.",
  "flows": "Reads pyproject.toml -> sets environment variables -> installs build requirements with pip -> builds wheel/sdist via hooks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of subprocess for pip install is standard; environment variable modifications are typical for virtual environment setup. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads build system requirements from 'pyproject.toml', creates a temporary environment, modifies environment variables to isolate dependencies, installs build dependencies via subprocess calls to pip, and invokes build hooks to generate wheels or sdist files. The approach aligns with standard build procedures for Python projects. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or system damage mechanisms are present. Usage of subprocess to call pip is common in build scripts, and environment variable manipulations are for environment isolation, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation for building Python package distributions. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. The only noteworthy aspect is the use of subprocess calls to pip, which is typical in build tools. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or security risks was found.",
