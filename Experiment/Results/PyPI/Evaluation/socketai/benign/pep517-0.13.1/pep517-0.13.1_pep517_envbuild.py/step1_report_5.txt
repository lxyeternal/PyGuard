{
  "purpose": "The code facilitates building Python wheel and sdist packages by setting up a temporary environment, installing dependencies, and invoking build hooks based on pyproject.toml.",
  "sources": "Reads input from pyproject.toml (file read), environment variables (os.environ), and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess check_call to invoke pip for package installation, potentially executing untrusted code via pip. Also modifies environment variables 'PATH' and 'PYTHONPATH', which could influence system behavior.",
  "flows": "Reads pyproject.toml -> installs dependencies via pip in a temporary environment -> calls build hooks for wheel or sdist creation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard Python libraries and well-known build procedures. No obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, or misleading variables are present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads build requirements from pyproject.toml, creates a temporary build environment, and installs dependencies via pip in subprocesses. It carefully manages environment variables to isolate the build environment. The subprocess calls to pip are standard for package building workflows. No suspicious network activity or malicious data handling observed. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices and does not contain any hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for building Python packages with proper dependency installation and environment management. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the analysis. It is safe for use in a secure environment.",
