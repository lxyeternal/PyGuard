  "purpose": "Provides utilities for managing PEP 517 build backends via subprocess calls, JSON data exchange, environment variable setup, and threading for logging.",
  "sources": "JSON files ('input.json', 'output.json'), environment variables ('PEP517_BUILD_BACKEND', 'PEP517_BACKEND_PATH'), subprocess command arguments, script obtained via '_in_proc_script_path()'.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution (check_call, check_output), JSON file reading/writing, environment variables, threading for logging output.",
  "flows": "JSON data is written to 'input.json' before subprocess call; subprocess runs script with parameters; output JSON is read from 'output.json'. Environment variables are set for subprocess; threading reads and logs subprocess output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic subprocess commands with parameters that could be influenced externally; reliance on environment variables and script paths that, if manipulated, could lead to command injection or environment manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code manages build backend interactions through subprocess calls, JSON serialization, environment variable configuration, and threading for logging. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. Subprocess commands are constructed from parameters like 'build_backend', 'backend_path', and 'python_executable', which could be exploited if supplied from untrusted sources. Exception handling and JSON communication are standard. Overall, the implementation appears typical for build tooling, with potential security considerations if inputs are not sanitized. The code itself does not contain malicious payloads or backdoors. The main concern is external input validation, not internal malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation for managing PEP 517 build backends, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The primary security risk relates to potential command injection if external inputs are untrusted, but the code itself is benign. Scores are appropriately assigned: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3 depending on input trust. Ensuring input sanitization would mitigate potential exploitation risks.",
