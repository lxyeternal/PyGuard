{
  "purpose": "This code provides a framework for interacting with PEP 517 build backends, including subprocess management, JSON data handling, and exception definitions for build process errors.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files ('input.json' and 'output.json'), environment variables, and subprocess command inputs.",
  "sinks": "Executes subprocesses via _subprocess_runner functions, writes to environment variables, reads JSON output, and handles system environment variables.",
  "flows": "JSON input is written in temp directories, subprocesses are invoked with environment variables, and JSON output is read back to determine success or errors.",
  "anomalies": "Uses temporary directories for subprocess communication; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a standard framework for build backend interactions with no signs of malicious intent. The subprocess invocations use safe environment variable passing and temporary directories to isolate processes. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or malicious data leaks are present. Exception classes are standard, and no suspicious or unusual code constructs are detected. The module handles build process automation and error reporting in a typical manner. No obfuscated code, malware, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of a PEP 517 build backend wrapper with no malicious or suspicious elements. It operates within expected boundaries for such tooling, with proper use of environment variables, subprocess calls, and JSON communication. Overall, it poses no security risks or malware concerns.",
