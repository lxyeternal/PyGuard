  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation for managing PEP 517 build backends, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The primary security risk relates to potential command injection if external inputs are untrusted, but the code itself is benign. Scores are appropriately assigned: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3 depending on input trust. Ensuring input sanitization would mitigate potential exploitation risks."
