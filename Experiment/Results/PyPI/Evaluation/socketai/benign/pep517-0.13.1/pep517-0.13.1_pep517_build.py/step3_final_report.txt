{
  "purpose": "This code implements a standard Python PEP 517 build process, loading build system info from 'pyproject.toml', installing dependencies, invoking build hooks, and moving build artifacts.",
  "sources": "Reading 'pyproject.toml' for build system info, dependencies specified in 'requires', and build hooks invoked via dynamic attribute access.",
  "sinks": "Installation of dependencies via 'env.pip_install', invocation of build hooks, and moving build artifacts from temporary directories to final destination.",
  "flows": "Source data from 'pyproject.toml' and external hooks flow into dependency installation and build hook invocation, culminating in moving build artifacts to the output directory.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity. Dependency installation depends on external configuration, which could be malicious if compromised, but the code itself is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical build script that reads configuration, installs dependencies, and runs build hooks. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary risk stems from trusting external dependencies and hooks, which is inherent in such systems but not a flaw in the code. Dynamic hook invocation via 'getattr' is standard and not malicious. Dependency installation from untrusted sources could be exploited, but this is outside the code's scope. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk ~0.2) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard build helper for Python projects with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main concern is external dependency trustworthiness, which is outside the code's control. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
