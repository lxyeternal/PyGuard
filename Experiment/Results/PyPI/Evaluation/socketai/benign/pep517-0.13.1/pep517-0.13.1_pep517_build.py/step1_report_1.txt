  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed",
    "Use of dynamic attribute access ('getattr') could be dangerous if hooks are compromised, but standard in plugin systems",
    "No obfuscated code or unusual language features detected",
    "Logging is standard; no suspicious network activity or obfuscation",
    "No code injection or data leakage observed"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script follows standard practices for building Python projects via PEP 517 hooks, dynamically loading hooks and dependencies. It loads build configurations from 'pyproject.toml', installs required dependencies, and executes build hooks to generate artifacts. The use of 'getattr' for dynamic hook invocation is common for plugin systems, not inherently malicious. The installation of dependencies via 'env.pip_install' could be risky if the environment or 'pyproject.toml' contents are maliciously manipulated to specify harmful dependencies. Moving files from temporary directories is standard. No malicious backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious network activity are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a standard build system for Python projects using PEP 517 hooks. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident from the source. The primary concern is dependency integrity, which depends on the trustworthiness of dependencies specified in 'pyproject.toml'. Overall, the code itself is benign and aligns with typical build scripts.",
