  "purpose": "The code is intended to automate building Python projects using PEP 517 hooks, including loading build system configurations, installing dependencies, and executing build steps.",
  "sources": "Reading 'pyproject.toml' file for build system configuration; receiving command-line arguments; importing modules; accessing hooks and environment methods; reading files during build process.",
  "sinks": "File operations (shutil.move, os.path.join, open); subprocess or environment method calls (pip_install); dynamically calling hooks (getattr), executing build commands.",
  "flows": "Reading pyproject.toml (source) to determine build system → installing dependencies via env.pip_install (sink) → invoking build hooks (sink) → moving build artifacts (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() to create temporary build directories; dynamic hook invocation via getattr; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or hidden backdoors evident; the code appears standard for a build automation process.",
  "analysis": "The script loads build configuration from 'pyproject.toml', validates required fields, installs dependencies, and executes build hooks, moving build artifacts to the destination directory. All operations involve standard file and dependency management, with no unusual data flow or suspicious code constructs. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or backdoors are present. The dynamic invocation of hooks and temporary directories are typical for build scripts. No malicious or sabotage code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build automation script for Python projects. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are identified. It performs expected tasks within a controlled environment, with no signs of supply chain attacks or malware.",
