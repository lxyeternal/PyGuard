  "purpose": "The script is designed to build Python projects using PEP 517 hooks by loading build system configurations, preparing dependencies, and executing build processes.",
  "sources": "File input from 'pyproject.toml' via os.path.join and open functions; environment variables indirectly through env.pip_install; command-line arguments parsed via argparse.",
  "sinks": "os.path.join for file path manipulations, shutil.move for moving build artifacts, env.pip_install for installing dependencies, logging for output, and potentially executing build hooks.",
  "flows": "Read build configuration from 'pyproject.toml' -> Load dependencies -> Install dependencies -> Call build hooks -> Move build artifacts to destination directory.",
  "anomalies": "Use of tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() is normal; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a build configuration from a 'pyproject.toml' file and uses the PEP 517 build hooks to compile a Python package. It installs necessary build dependencies dynamically via env.pip_install, then uses temporary directories to perform builds, moving output files to a destination. All operations rely on standard Python libraries and well-known conventions for building Python packages. No suspicious network activity, hidden backdoors, or malicious data handling observed. The code appears to be a standard build script with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a typical build automation tool for Python projects. No malicious or sabotage behaviors detected. The code does not perform any harmful actions such as network exfiltration, reverse shells, or unauthorized data access.",
