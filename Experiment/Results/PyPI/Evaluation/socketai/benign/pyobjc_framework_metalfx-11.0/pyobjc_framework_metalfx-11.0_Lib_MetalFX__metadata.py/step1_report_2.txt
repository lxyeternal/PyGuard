{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be auto-generated metadata registration for Objective-C bindings related to MetalFX or similar framework, defining selector metadata for various descriptor classes and properties.",
  "sources": "The code reads system information (sys.maxsize, objc.arch), and registers metadata for Objective-C selectors using objc.registerMetaDataForSelector.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks that process untrusted input into sensitive operations; the code primarily sets metadata and defines functions based on system architecture.",
  "flows": "The flow involves system checks influencing function definitions, followed by registration of metadata for Objective-C classes and methods, without any apparent untrusted data flow to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code involves metadata registration and conditional function definitions based on system architecture, which is standard for bindings.",
  "analysis": "The code auto-generates metadata for Objective-C classes and methods, including setting return types and arguments. It performs environment checks for system architecture and CPU architecture, then registers selector metadata accordingly. This is typical for language bindings. No malicious behavior, such as network activity, data theft, or backdoors, is present. The code appears to be legitimate and standard for auto-generated bindings. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard auto-generated metadata registration for Objective-C bindings, with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It solely sets up method metadata based on system architecture, typical in framework binding code.",
