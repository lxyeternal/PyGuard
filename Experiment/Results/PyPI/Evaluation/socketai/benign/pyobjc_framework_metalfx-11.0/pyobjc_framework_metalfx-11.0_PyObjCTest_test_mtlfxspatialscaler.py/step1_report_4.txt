{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of unit tests and helper classes for testing the MetalFX framework's spatial scaler protocol and constants.",
  "sources": "Code reads constants, class definitions, and method signatures, primarily for testing purposes. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present. The code does not handle or output user data, network communication, or file operations.",
  "flows": "The code establishes class and method signatures for testing, with flow limited to method calls within the test framework; no external data flow or injection points identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden behaviors, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward test code defining classes and assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a mock helper class for testing MetalFX protocol methods, sets up constants and protocol tests, and performs type assertions on method signatures. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security risks. The code is consistent with standard testing practices and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign set of unit tests and mock class definitions for the MetalFX framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious code segments. It is solely for testing protocol conformance and constants.",
