{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a unit test for a MetalFX spatial scaler protocol and related helper class, used to verify constants, protocol existence, and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools.TestSupport, objc, and MetalFX modules; method return values; protocol assertions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is for testing and does not process untrusted input data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code behavior observed. The code structure and imports are standard for Objective-C bridge testing with Python.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a test class inheriting from TestCase, verifying constants and protocol method signatures for MetalFX's spatial scaler. Helper class methods return fixed integers, consistent with test stubs. No external data handling, network operations, or credential usage. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks. The code performs typical unit tests on an API interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for MetalFX's spatial scaler protocol, with no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks identified. It simply validates constants, protocols, and method signatures for the API.",
