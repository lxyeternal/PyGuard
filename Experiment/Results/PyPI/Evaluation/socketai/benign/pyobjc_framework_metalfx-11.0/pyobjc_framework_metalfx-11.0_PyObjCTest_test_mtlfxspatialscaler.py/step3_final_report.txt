{
  "purpose": "The code defines a helper class with fixed return values for testing MetalFX spatial scaler protocol methods and a test suite verifying constants, protocol existence, and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Methods returning fixed values; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static method calls and assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite for API conformance, with fixed return values, no external data, network activity, or malicious behavior. It verifies constants, protocol existence, and method signatures, all typical for testing frameworks. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for API validation, with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting its safe and standard nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
