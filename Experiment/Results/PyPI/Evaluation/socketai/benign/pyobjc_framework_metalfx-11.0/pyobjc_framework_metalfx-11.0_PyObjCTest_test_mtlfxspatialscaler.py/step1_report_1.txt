{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of unit tests for a MetalFX spatial scaler module, specifically testing constants, protocol existence, and method signatures.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data sources; it defines classes and methods, and accesses constants and protocol information.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only verifies the structure and types of existing classes and methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code strictly tests protocol adherence and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a helper class with static return values and a test class that verifies constants, protocol existence, and method signatures. It uses standard testing assertions without any dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling beyond simple type checks. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign unit test suite for a MetalFX module, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
