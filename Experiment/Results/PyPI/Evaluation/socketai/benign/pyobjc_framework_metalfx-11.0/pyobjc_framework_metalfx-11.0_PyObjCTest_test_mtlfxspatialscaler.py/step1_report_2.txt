{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the MetalFX framework's spatial scaler protocol and related constants, verifying protocol conformance and method signatures.",
  "sources": "Import statements for testing frameworks, the definitions of helper classes, and the test methods invoking framework constants and methods.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not perform any data output, network activity, or handling of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes and performs assertions on constants and protocol existence.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code strictly focuses on testing protocol conformance and constants.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing modules and a framework ('MetalFX') related to Metal graphics, defines a helper class mimicking protocol methods with fixed return values, and a test class that verifies constants and protocol conformance. The test methods check enum types, constants, protocol existence, and method signatures, all typical for unit testing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious code activities.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard unit test suite for MetalFX protocol and constants, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code is focused on validation and verification of framework features.",
