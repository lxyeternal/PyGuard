  "purpose": "Unit testing for the MetalFX module, verifying metadata sanity of callables",
  "sources": "Import statements for testing support and MetalFX module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs a test assertion",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard import and test assertion without suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing support module and the MetalFX framework, then defines a test case that asserts the correctness of callable metadata within MetalFX. It appears to be a straightforward unit test with no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no malicious functions or data handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The test is simple and adheres to typical Python testing patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic unit test for the MetalFX module with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs a standard sanity check on callable metadata, with no indicators of malicious or maliciously crafted code.",
