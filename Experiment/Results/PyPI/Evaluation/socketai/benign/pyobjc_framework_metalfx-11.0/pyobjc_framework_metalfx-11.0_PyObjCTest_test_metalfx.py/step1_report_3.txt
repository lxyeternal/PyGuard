  "purpose": "Unit test class for MetalFX module, verifying metadata sanity.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing TestCase from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and MetalFX module.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data flow to external systems or untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard test code with normal import and assertion.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework component and a native module, then defines a test class with a single test method that checks metadata sanity. The use of 'assertCallableMetadataIsSane' appears to be a typical test assertion method. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present. The code structure is straightforward and typical for a unit test.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard unit testing code for the MetalFX module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign test script.",
