{
  "purpose": "The code is a test case that verifies the metadata of the MetalFX module for correctness.",
  "sources": "Imports from PyObjCTools.TestSupport and the MetalFX module",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external output is present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely performs an assertion on a module",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual constructs; straightforward test code",
  "analysis": "The script imports testing utilities and a specific module, then defines a test case class with a single test method that asserts the integrity of metadata in the MetalFX module. There are no hardcoded secrets, environment variable usage, network calls, or other malicious behaviors. The code appears to be a standard unit test for module validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple unit test with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It only verifies module metadata and does not perform any risky operations.",
