  "flows": "No data flows; the code does not process or transfer any data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple comment with no suspicious or unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comment string '\"\"\" Test suite \"\"\"' with no executable statements, functions, imports, or data handling. Given its trivial nature, there are no sources, sinks, or flows. The absence of code logic or suspicious patterns indicates no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code's benign and non-executable nature. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), as the code's simplicity leaves little room for misinterpretation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign comment with no malicious or security concerns. All scores should be set to zero, reflecting no malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The analysis confirms that the code poses no threat or suspicious activity.",
