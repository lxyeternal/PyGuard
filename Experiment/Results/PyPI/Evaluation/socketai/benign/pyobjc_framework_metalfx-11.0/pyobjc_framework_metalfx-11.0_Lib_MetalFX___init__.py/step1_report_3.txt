  "purpose": "The code dynamically loads and sets up the MetalFX framework by importing necessary modules and creating framework directory and attribute functions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, Metal, objc, and local modules _metadata and _MetalFX; calls to objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr",
  "sinks": "The code uses dynamic attribute creation and modifies global functions (__dir__, __getattr__), which could potentially be exploited if misused, but in this context appears benign.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> calls objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr with framework details -> assigns dynamic functions to globals -> deletes a module from sys.modules",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic function creation (__dir__, __getattr__) and deletion from sys.modules could be misused in a malicious context, but here it appears as a standard pattern for framework loading. The code is minimal and does not handle untrusted input.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up the MetalFX framework dynamically by creating framework directory and attribute functions via objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr. It modifies the global namespace by assigning __dir__ and __getattr__, which is a common pattern for dynamic module attributes. The code then deletes a specific module from sys.modules, potentially to prevent re-imports or for cleanup. There are no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious logic. The overall structure is consistent with framework loading routines, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a setup routine for the MetalFX framework, utilizing dynamic attribute creation. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware signatures. The pattern used is common for dynamic framework loading in Python, and there are no indications of sabotage or security risks.",
