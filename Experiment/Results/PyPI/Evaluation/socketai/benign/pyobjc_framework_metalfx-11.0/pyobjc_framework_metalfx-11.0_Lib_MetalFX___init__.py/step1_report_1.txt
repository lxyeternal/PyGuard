{
  "purpose": "The code is a Python module for interfacing with the MetalFX framework on macOS, setting up dynamic framework loading and attribute handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, Metal, objc, and local modules; dynamic framework path via objc.pathForFramework.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic creation of __dir__ and __getattr__ functions for module attributes, deletion of sys.modules entry.",
  "flows": "Imports -> dynamic framework loading via objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr -> assignment of globals -> removal of sys.modules entry.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute creation (__dir__, __getattr__) and deletion of module entries at runtime; no explicit input/output handling or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads a macOS framework (MetalFX) using objc, creates module attribute access functions dynamically, and removes the module reference from sys.modules. This approach may be used for obfuscation or to delay loading. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of createFrameworkDirAndGetattr is standard for dynamic framework loading but can be seen as unusual if not expected. Overall, the code appears to be a standard setup for dynamic framework access with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate setup routine for dynamically loading a macOS framework and managing module attributes. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
