  "purpose": "Initialize and load the MetalFX framework dynamically within a Python module.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules (sys, Metal, objc, local _metadata, _MetalFX) and reads a framework path '/System/Library/Frameworks/MetalFX.framework'.",
  "sinks": "Dynamically creates __dir__ and __getattr__ functions to expose framework functionalities; deletes a module from sys.modules.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> calls objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr with framework path -> assigns generated functions to globals -> deletes a module from sys.modules",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic function creation and global namespace manipulation; deletes module from sys.modules without apparent reason; no documentation or explicit error handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs dynamic framework loading and function assignment using Objective-C bridge functions. The dynamic creation of __dir__ and __getattr__ functions allows flexible access to framework attributes, which is typical in bridging scenarios. Deleting a module from sys.modules may be for cleanup or to prevent re-imports. No data leaks, no network activity, no credential handling, and no suspicious code behaviors are present. The code's purpose appears to be legitimate framework setup, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup routine for a Python wrapper around a system framework, employing dynamic attribute creation. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and well-intentioned.",
