  "purpose": "To load and initialize the MetalFX framework in Python by dynamically importing and setting up framework attributes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys, Metal, objc, and local modules (_metadata, _MetalFX); call to objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr() which loads framework data.",
  "sinks": "Globals assignment (__dir__, __getattr__) which could influence module attribute access; deletion of sys.modules entry, which affects module import behavior.",
  "flows": "Import sys and framework modules -> createFrameworkDirAndGetattr() loads framework and returns directory and getattr functions -> assigns them to global __dir__ and __getattr__ -> deletes module from sys.modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute creation (__dir__, __getattr__) which could be used to hide or manipulate attribute access; deletion of module from sys.modules may obscure module presence or tamper with import behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads a framework and sets up module attribute accessors, which is typical for binding external frameworks in Python. The removal of the module from sys.modules could be unusual but not inherently malicious. There are no hardcoded secrets, network activity, or other suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be standard framework setup code, with some dynamic features that could be misused if manipulated, but in this context, they serve legitimate purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical framework loading routine with dynamic attribute setup, not exhibiting malicious intent. There is no evidence of malware or malicious data flow. The main concern is the dynamic attribute creation and removal from sys.modules, which could be used to obscure behavior but is not inherently malicious.",
