  "purpose": "Dynamically loads the MetalFX framework on macOS using Objective-C bridging, setting up attribute access functions and cleaning up module entries.",
  "sources": "Framework path in '/System/Library/Frameworks/MetalFX.framework', import statements, dynamic attribute creation via objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr.",
  "sinks": "Assignment to globals()['__dir__'], globals()['__getattr__'], deletion from sys.modules.",
  "flows": "Framework path input → createFrameworkDirAndGetattr generates __dir__ and __getattr__ functions → assigned to globals → module uses these for attribute access → module deletes its own entry from sys.modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute functions (__dir__, __getattr__), deletion of module from sys.modules, no docstrings, minimal static analysis hints of obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dynamic framework loading for macOS, employing objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr to generate attribute access functions, which are assigned globally. It then deletes its own module entry from sys.modules, a pattern sometimes used to prevent direct access or obscure module presence. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The techniques used are common in system bindings and Objective-C bridging, though they can be misused for obfuscation. The code's behavior aligns with legitimate framework setup routines, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, legitimate setup routine for dynamically loading the MetalFX framework on macOS. It employs known patterns for Objective-C bridging in Python. There is no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The use of dynamic attribute functions and module deletion, while somewhat unusual, are standard in such contexts and do not indicate malicious intent.",
