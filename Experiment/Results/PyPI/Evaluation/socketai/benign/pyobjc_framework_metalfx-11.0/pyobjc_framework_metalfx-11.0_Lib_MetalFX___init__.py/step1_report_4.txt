{
  "purpose": "To dynamically load and initialize the MetalFX framework and related modules for use in Python.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules 'sys', 'Metal', 'objc', and internal modules '_metadata' and '_MetalFX'. It also calls 'objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr' with framework details, and deletes a module from 'sys.modules'.",
  "sinks": "The code manipulates 'globals()', modifies the module search path, and deletes a module from 'sys.modules'. These actions could potentially be exploited to alter module loading behavior or hide malicious modules.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules -> calls 'createFrameworkDirAndGetattr' to set up dynamic attribute access -> modifies 'globals()' to assign custom '__dir__' and '__getattr__' -> deletes an entry from 'sys.modules'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr' to generate dynamic framework loading functions is unusual outside of legitimate extension modules. Deletion of a specific module from 'sys.modules' may be used to hide or manipulate module import behavior. No explicit malicious code or obfuscated logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The script appears to be setting up dynamic framework loading via Objective-C bridging, a common pattern in macOS/iOS development. The use of 'createFrameworkDirAndGetattr' to create custom directory and attribute functions is standard in some binding contexts. Modifying 'globals()' to override '__dir__' and '__getattr__' is a legitimate technique for dynamic attribute access. Removing a module from 'sys.modules' could be benign or potentially suspicious if used to hide or prevent re-import of certain modules. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious network activity. No obfuscated code or hardcoded secrets are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate dynamic framework loading and attribute management specific to macOS/iOS development environments. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks based on the provided code. Its behavior is consistent with legitimate use of Objective-C bridging in Python.",
