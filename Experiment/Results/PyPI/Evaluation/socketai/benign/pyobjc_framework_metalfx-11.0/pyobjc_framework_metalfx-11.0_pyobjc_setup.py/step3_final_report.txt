{
  "purpose": "The code manages the setup, build, testing, and configuration routines for the PyObjC framework on macOS, including gathering system info, configuring build flags, and running tests.",
  "sources": "System commands (`sw_vers`, `clang`, `xcrun`), environment variables, and file reads (`PKG-INFO`, SDK plist files). Dynamic import of test modules during testing.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess outputs influence build flags and SDK info; environment variables affect build configuration; dynamic imports load test modules.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and files into subprocess commands and build configuration parameters, influencing build and test routines.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. Use of subprocess and dynamic imports are standard but could be exploited if environment/files are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs system info retrieval and build setup typical for macOS Python extensions. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Subprocess calls are standard for environment detection. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. The reliance on environment and system commands is typical for such build scripts, assuming a trusted environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build and test setup script with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is moderate (~0.2), reflecting reliance on environment and system commands but no malicious activity.",
