{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package that provides wrappers for the MetalFX framework on macOS, facilitating integration with Python using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Reading of os.path.dirname(__file__), os.listdir('Modules'), and os.path.join() for dependency listing; importing os, sys, and pyobjc_setup modules.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or transmits untrusted data; the setup process uses standard package configuration without network or system modification beyond standard build procedures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file system reads (os.listdir, os.path.join) to package configuration parameters, with environment variables and package dependencies managed via standard Python packaging practices.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code appears to be standard setup script with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical package setup for a macOS-specific framework wrapper using PyObjC. It dynamically reads module dependencies from the 'Modules' directory and constructs extension modules accordingly. No network activity, code injection, or suspicious data handling is observed. The code relies on standard library functions and third-party setup tools, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package wrapping a macOS framework, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
