  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'pyobjc-framework-MetalFX' Python extension, wrapping the MetalFX framework on macOS.",
  "sources": "Reading __file__, listing files in the 'Modules' directory, importing system modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or data exfiltration activities.",
  "flows": "Listing files in 'Modules' to determine dependencies, then configuring extension modules with framework linkage.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, performing typical filesystem and package configuration tasks. It does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The dynamic listing of 'Modules' files is common in build scripts and does not indicate malicious intent. No network activity or data leaks are present. All signals point to benign, routine package setup operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script for a Python extension package. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
