{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for creating Python bindings (wrappers) for the MetalFX framework on macOS, facilitating its use within Python projects.",
  "sources": "Reads its own directory to list files in 'Modules' for dependencies, and uses environment variables via 'os' and 'sys' modules. No external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network communication, file writing, or execution of untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads local file system information to configure the build; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, obfuscated sections, or hardcoded secrets. The code performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and a setup utility for building Python C extensions. It dynamically constructs a list of dependencies based on files in the 'Modules' directory and configures an extension module for compilation with framework linking. The code appears to be a typical build script for Python C extensions, with no malicious behavior or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign setup script used for packaging Python bindings to a macOS framework. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
