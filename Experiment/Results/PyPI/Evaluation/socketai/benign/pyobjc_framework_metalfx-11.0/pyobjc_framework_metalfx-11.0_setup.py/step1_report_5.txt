  "purpose": "Setup script for creating Python bindings for the MetalFX framework on macOS, using pyobjc to generate extension modules.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, filesystem operations (os.listdir), and module imports.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs; mainly static setup configuration.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations. The flow involves reading module files and configuring build parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, and no hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script utilizing setuptools-like configuration for building a pyobjc extension module. It dynamically lists files in the 'Modules' directory for dependencies, but this is typical for such build scripts. The script references the MetalFX framework on macOS and manages dependencies. No data is being transmitted externally, no command execution is present, and the code does not perform any suspicious operations. The only potentially noteworthy point is the dynamic listing of files in the 'Modules' directory, but this is normal for extension setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for packaging Python bindings to the MetalFX framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign build configuration.",
