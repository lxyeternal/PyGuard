  "purpose": "CLI tool for managing Google API credentials, including login and token printing functionalities.",
  "sources": "User input arguments for commands and options, external 'auth' module functions ('save_user_credentials' and 'load_user_credentials')",
  "sinks": "Printing access tokens to stdout, reading credentials from specified JSON files",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> argument parsing -> function calls ('save_user_credentials' or 'load_user_credentials') -> output (token printed or credentials saved)",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or network activity; straightforward flow and standard help messages",
  "analysis": "The code implements a CLI interface delegating credential operations to an external 'auth' module. It handles user input securely, with no embedded secrets or malicious patterns. The token printing is a standard feature but could lead to token leakage if misused, which is typical for such tools. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk ~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature. External 'auth' module security is assumed but not verifiable here; however, the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, secure CLI utility for credential management with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
