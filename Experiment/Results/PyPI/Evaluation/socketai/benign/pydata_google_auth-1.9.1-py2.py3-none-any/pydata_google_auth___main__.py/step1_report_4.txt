  "purpose": "CLI tool for managing Google API credentials, including login and token printing.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (scopes, credentials paths, client IDs, secrets, webserver options). Uses functions auth.save_user_credentials() and auth.load_user_credentials().",
  "sinks": "Calls auth.save_user_credentials() which likely writes credentials to a file; prints credentials token to stdout.",
  "flows": "User inputs command-line options -> login() or print_token() functions invoked -> credentials saved or token printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials. No unusual code constructs. Help texts are benign. The code handles credential management securely and does not perform any network activity directly.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper for authentication operations. It captures user input securely and invokes external auth functions. No evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. It uses standard argparse patterns and calls to presumed secure external auth functions. No hardcoded secrets are present. No unsafe data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate credential management CLI tool for Google APIs. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code segment.",
