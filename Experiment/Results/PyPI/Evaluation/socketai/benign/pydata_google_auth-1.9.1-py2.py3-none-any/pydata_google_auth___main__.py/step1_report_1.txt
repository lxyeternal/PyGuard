  "purpose": "This module implements a CLI tool for managing Google API credentials, including login and token printing functionalities.",
  "sources": "User input through command-line arguments: 'destination', 'scopes', 'client_id', 'client_secret', 'use_local_webserver', 'nouse_local_webserver', and 'credentials_path'. It also reads credentials files for token extraction.",
  "sinks": "Credentials loading and saving functions ('auth.save_user_credentials' and 'auth.load_user_credentials'), printing tokens to stdout.",
  "flows": "User provides arguments; 'login' flow calls 'auth.save_user_credentials' with scopes, client ID/secret, and webserver options. 'print-token' flow loads credentials and prints token.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or tokens. The code uses user-provided parameters for OAuth flow. No suspicious network connections or obfuscated code detected. The help messages are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides command-line options for OAuth login and token printing, utilizing external 'auth' functions. It handles user input safely, without hardcoded secrets or data leaks. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident. The flow involves reading user inputs, calling functions to handle credentials, and printing tokens, which are standard for such tools. The code does not perform any network communication directly nor include any covert operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard credential management CLI tool for Google APIs. No malicious behavior or security risks are present based on this code snippet. It is safe and does not contain any malware or obfuscated code.",
