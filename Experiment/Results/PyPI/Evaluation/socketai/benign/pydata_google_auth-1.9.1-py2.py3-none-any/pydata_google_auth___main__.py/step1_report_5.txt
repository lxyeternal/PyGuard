  "purpose": "This code provides CLI tools for managing Google API credentials, including login and token printing functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments for credentials paths, scope strings, client IDs/secrets, and command options.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include credential loading (`auth.load_user_credentials`) and printing tokens, which could leak tokens if mishandled.",
  "flows": "User provides credentials file path or options via CLI; credentials are loaded or saved accordingly, tokens are printed to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward CLI handling with no obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI interface for managing Google API credentials, involving argument parsing, credential saving/loading, and token printing. It delegates core functions to the 'auth' module, which is not shown but presumably handles credential security properly. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic is evident. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns and no signs of obfuscation or malware. It appears to be legitimate utility code intended for credential management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign CLI tool for credential management. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident within this module. It operates as expected without any signs of malware or security threats.",
