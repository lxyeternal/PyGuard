{
  "purpose": "A CLI tool for managing Google API credentials, including login and token printing functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for 'destination', 'scopes', 'client_id', 'client_secret', 'credentials_path', and flags for webserver use.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes untrusted data or executes untrusted commands; credentials are saved via auth.save_user_credentials, and tokens are printed after loading credentials.",
  "flows": "Command-line input flows into 'login' or 'print-token' functions, which invoke 'auth' module functions to handle credentials.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious external calls or obfuscated code; the code primarily manages OAuth credential handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI interface for Google OAuth credential management, with arguments for scopes, client IDs, secrets, and credential storage. It uses the 'auth' module for sensitive operations but does not perform unsafe operations within this fragment. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or malicious behaviors are evident. The logic appears straightforward and safe, focused on credential management.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate credential management CLI tool for Google APIs, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided fragment.",
