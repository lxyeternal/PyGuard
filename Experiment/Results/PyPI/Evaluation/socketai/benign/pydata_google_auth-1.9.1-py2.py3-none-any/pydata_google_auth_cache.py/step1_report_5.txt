  "purpose": "Implementations for reading, writing, and caching Google OAuth2 credentials, including support for user and service account credentials.",
  "sources": "Reads data from credential JSON files, environment variables for config paths, and credential objects passed into save methods.",
  "sinks": "Writes credentials JSON data to files on disk.",
  "flows": "Loads credential info from files or environment variables; credentials are refreshed if invalid; credentials are saved to disk when save methods are called.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No obfuscated code, malicious code, or hidden backdoors. Usage of standard credential handling libraries and methods with no suspicious network activity. Directory creation handles race conditions correctly. No unusual or suspicious logic paths or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation for managing OAuth2 credentials, including loading from files, refreshing expired credentials, and saving credentials to disk. It uses established libraries (`google.oauth2`, `google.auth.transport.requests`) and handles errors gracefully with logging. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The credential flows follow common patterns for OAuth2 credential management. There is no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malware. The code adheres to best practices and does not contain suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and standard implementation for credential caching and management. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on the provided source. It handles credentials securely, with proper error handling and no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
