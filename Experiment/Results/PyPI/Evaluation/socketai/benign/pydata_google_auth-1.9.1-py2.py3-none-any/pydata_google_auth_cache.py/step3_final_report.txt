  "purpose": "Provides mechanisms to load and save Google OAuth2 credentials from/to disk, including refresh logic and credential management.",
  "sources": "Reading credential JSON files from disk, environment variables for paths, and credential data structures in memory.",
  "sinks": "Writing credential JSON files to disk, potentially exposing sensitive data if filesystem permissions are lax.",
  "flows": "Source: disk or environment variables -> in-memory credential objects -> refresh if expired -> save back to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Minor typo in comment ('direcory' instead of 'directory').",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard credential caching with proper error handling, token refresh, and filesystem operations. No malicious patterns, network activity, or obfuscation are present. Credential files are stored in user directories, which is typical but relies on filesystem permissions for security. The logic for loading, saving, and refreshing credentials is correct and uses well-established libraries. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for credential caching with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is appropriate given the handling of sensitive credentials, which should be protected at the filesystem level. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0. The overall security posture is sound.",
