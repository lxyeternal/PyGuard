  "purpose": "Provides mechanisms to load, save, and cache Google OAuth2 credentials to disk for authentication purposes.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, reading credential files from disk, loading credentials JSON data, loading credentials info from dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Writing credential JSON data to files, creating directories, possibly overwriting credentials files.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or files -> loading credentials JSON -> constructing credentials objects -> optional refresh -> saving credentials JSON to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated or malicious code patterns; no suspicious network activity; standard credential handling logic. No apparent backdoors or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard credential caching and loading for Google OAuth2 credentials. It reads configuration paths from environment variables, loads credentials JSON from files, constructs credentials objects, refreshes tokens if needed, and saves credentials back to files. The methods use established libraries (google.oauth2.credentials, service_account) and include error handling for file I/O and refresh errors. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or hidden backdoors. The only potential security concern is the storage of sensitive credentials in plain JSON files, which is typical but should be protected at filesystem level.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs credential caching and management for Google APIs with standard practices. No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident. It’s a typical implementation for credential storage with no suspicious or harmful logic present.",
