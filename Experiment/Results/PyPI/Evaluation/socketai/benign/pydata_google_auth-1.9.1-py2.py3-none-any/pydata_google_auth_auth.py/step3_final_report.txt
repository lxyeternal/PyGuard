{
  "purpose": "This code manages OAuth 2.0 credentials for Google APIs, handling user authorization, credential caching, and refresh flows.",
  "sources": "User input prompts, hardcoded client IDs and secrets, credential cache files, environment variables, OAuth URL generation.",
  "sinks": "Credential objects, URL prompts for user authorization, credential cache storage, network requests for token refresh.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (user prompts, cache, environment) flow into OAuth flows, credential fetching, and refresh procedures; credentials are stored and used for API access.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded client IDs and secrets in plaintext, broad exception handling in OAuth flows, plaintext secrets stored in variables.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard OAuth credential management for Google APIs, including user prompts, token refresh, and credential caching. The main security concern is the embedding of client secrets directly in the code, which could lead to exposure if the code is compromised. No malicious network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is clear and straightforward, with no signs of malicious sabotage or obfuscation. The security risk score is elevated due to plaintext secrets, but there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate OAuth credential management code with no malicious activity detected. The primary concern is the insecure handling of client secrets, which should be managed securely via environment variables or secure storage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2–0.3, reflecting the secret management issue but not malicious behavior.",
