  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate OAuth credential management code with no malicious activity detected. The primary concern is the insecure handling of client secrets, which should be managed securely via environment variables or secure storage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2–0.3, reflecting the secret management issue but not malicious behavior."
