  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard credential management, reads hardcoded client IDs/secrets, user input, credential files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** OAuth flows, credential caching, user prompts.\n- **Anomalies:** Presence of hardcoded client secrets in plaintext, which is a security concern but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected; standard OAuth implementation. The only security concern is the plaintext secrets, which are visible but not malicious.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate, no malicious code detected.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 — reasonable given the plaintext secrets.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment aligns with the code's behavior. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar credential management, includes hardcoded secrets, user prompts, credential cache.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above; no malicious activity, but hardcoded secrets are a security concern.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Security Risk: 0.3 — slightly higher, justified due to embedded secrets.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general pattern, handling Colab environment, OAuth flows.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; the main concern remains the hardcoded secrets.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard OAuth credential management, includes user prompts, credential cache.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; presence of hardcoded secrets is a concern but not malicious.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — correct.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general OAuth credential handling, no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent; only concern is plaintext client secrets.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — correct.  \n- Security Risk: 0.2 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly elevated (0.2-0.3) due to hardcoded secrets, which is a security concern but not malicious.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- The primary concern is the plaintext storage of client secrets, which should be managed securely, but this does not constitute malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — due to embedded secrets, but not a high risk.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard OAuth credential management module with no signs of supply chain sabotage or malicious behavior. The main issue is secret management practices, which should be improved, but that does not alter the malware or obfuscation scores.",
