  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code, and then synthesize an overall evaluation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard credential management.\n- **Sources:** User input, hardcoded client IDs/secrets.\n- **Sinks:** Credentials, URLs, input prompts.\n- **Flows:** OAuth flows, credential caching, refresh.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded client IDs and secrets in plaintext.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, just standard OAuth. The hardcoded secrets are security concerns but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent; code appears legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is sound. The only security concern is plaintext secrets, which is common but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar credential management, with emphasis on sources and sinks.\n- **Sources:** User input, environment, credential files.\n- **Sinks:** Credentials, URLs, network requests.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded client IDs/secrets, use of input prompts.\n- **Analysis:** Standard OAuth flows, security risk mainly from plaintext secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just security concern over embedded secrets.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1; no malicious activity detected, but plaintext secrets are a concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** OAuth2 for Google APIs, with Colab support.\n- **Sources:** Cache, environment, user input.\n- **Sinks:** Credentials, files, network for token refresh.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded client IDs/secrets.\n- **Analysis:** Standard OAuth, no malicious activity, just security concern over secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate credential management, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Same conclusion; code is standard, with plaintext secrets being the main concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** OAuth2 credential management.\n- **Sources:** User input, cache, environment.\n- **Sinks:** Credentials, network requests.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded client IDs/secrets, no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis:** Standard OAuth, no malicious activity, plaintext secrets are security concern.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard credential handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with others; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar credential management.\n- **Sources:** User input, cache, environment.\n- **Sinks:** Credentials, network.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, but mentions plaintext client secrets stored in variables.\n- **Analysis:** Standard OAuth flows, no malicious actions, but storage of secrets in plaintext variables is a security concern.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; code appears legitimate.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly more cautious about plaintext secrets, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Presence of hardcoded client IDs and secrets:** All reports note this as a security concern, but none suggest malicious intent. Embedding secrets in code is a common practice in SDKs, though discouraged.\n- **Malware/malicious activity:** No signs of malware, backdoors, code injection, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Anomalies:** Broad exception handling, plaintext secrets, but these are typical for OAuth implementations and not malicious.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0** since there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The **obfuscated score** should be **0** as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The **risk score** should be **moderate** (around 0.2-0.3), primarily due to the presence of plaintext secrets, which could be exploited if the code is compromised, but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|--------------------|------------|\n| **0**           | **0**              | **0.2-0.3** |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis: legitimate credential management code with security concerns over embedded secrets, but no malicious or sabotage activity.",
