  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code manages Google API credentials, sourcing from user input, hardcoded client IDs/secrets, and credential files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; credentials are fetched, refreshed, and cached, with user prompts for authorization.\n- **Anomalies:** Presence of hardcoded client IDs and secrets is noted as a security concern but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The reasoning correctly states that the code is standard OAuth handling with no malicious activity. The security concern about plaintext secrets is valid but doesn't imply malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2 (reasonable).\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is sound. No issues with logic or scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar credential management, with user input, environment variables, and credential files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly described; involves OAuth URL generation, user prompts, credential storage, and refresh.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded client IDs and secrets are highlighted as security risks, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately notes the security risk but finds no malicious behavior. The broad exception handling is standard but could mask errors; this is acknowledged.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.3 (slightly higher due to secrets).\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. The higher security risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar to above, with credential flows and environment handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; involves credential storage, refresh, and network requests.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded secrets again, security concern but no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states that the code performs standard OAuth flows with no malicious activity. The security concern about secrets is valid.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar credential management, with focus on credential storage and OAuth flows.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Well described; involves credential fetching, storing, and refresh.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded secrets, but no malicious code or network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly states that the code is standard OAuth handling, with no signs of malicious activity. The presence of secrets is a concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; similar credential flows.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate; credential storage, refresh, and network requests.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code; plaintext secrets are a concern but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states that the code is standard OAuth management, with no malicious behaviors. The main concern is plaintext secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Security Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, network exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's readability.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly 0.2 or 0.3, reflecting the presence of hardcoded secrets, which is a security concern but not malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** Given the presence of hardcoded secrets, a risk score of around 0.2-0.3 is justified. I would suggest **0.2** as a balanced estimate, considering the code's legitimate purpose but acknowledging secret management issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2             |\n\nThe code appears legitimate, designed for credential management, with no malicious or sabotage behaviors. The primary concern is secret exposure, which should be addressed in secure secret management practices.",
