  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, assessing the scores, and ensuring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes credential management, user prompts, and hardcoded client IDs/secrets.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard OAuth flows with credential caching and refresh.\n- **Anomalies:** Presence of hardcoded client secrets in plaintext. This is a security concern but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected; code is standard for OAuth credential handling. The main issue is plaintext secrets, which are a security risk but not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)\n- Security Risk: 0.2 (reasonable, due to plaintext secrets)\n- Confidence: 0.9 (high)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar credential management, with user input, environment variables, and credential files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** OAuth flows involving URL printing, user prompts, credential cache.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded client IDs and secrets again. Significant security concern but no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard OAuth implementation, with the same security concern as Report 1. No malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.3 (slightly higher, reflecting the more explicit mention of security concern)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar OAuth handling, with Colab support.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded secrets again; broad exception handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard OAuth flows, no malicious behavior. Security concern remains due to plaintext secrets.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2 (consistent)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Credential management, with user prompts and cache.\n- **Anomalies:** Hardcoded secrets; no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard OAuth code, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.8\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar credential flows, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; plaintext secrets are not present here.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard OAuth credential management, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security Risk: 0.2\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard OAuth credential management.\n- The main security concern across reports is the presence of hardcoded client IDs and secrets, which are plaintext and could be misused if the code is compromised.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity are present.\n- Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected) — consistent across reports.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected) — consistent.\n\n**Risk score:** Given the security concern about hardcoded secrets, a risk score of around 0.2–0.3 is justified. The reports' scores of 0.2–0.3 seem reasonable, but perhaps slightly conservative.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.3 (to reflect the plaintext secrets, which could be exploited if code is leaked or misused)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is standard OAuth credential management with a notable security concern regarding plaintext client secrets, but no malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- Remove or secure the client secrets (e.g., environment variables, secure storage).\n- Continue monitoring for any signs of malicious modifications.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- Malware: **0**\n- Obfuscated: **0**\n- Risk: **0.3**",
