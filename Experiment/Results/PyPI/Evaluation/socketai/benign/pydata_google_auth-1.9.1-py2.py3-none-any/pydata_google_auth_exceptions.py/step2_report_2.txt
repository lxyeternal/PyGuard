  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of two custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions, with descriptive docstrings.\n   - There are no signs of input handling, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly state that the code is benign and purely definitional.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The reasoning is sound: the code is straightforward and safe.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (certain about benign nature)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious behavior, a high risk score (>0.5) would be unjustified.\n   - The current scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they only describe what the code does.\n   - No overreach or speculation is present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk detected)\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard, benign definition of custom exception classes for error handling. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided assessments.**",
