  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and whether the scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only contains class definitions for custom exceptions, with no input handling, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - No anomalies, secrets, or malicious code are present.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign, with no malicious patterns or security risks.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - Malware: 0 (no malware)\n     - SecurityRisk: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, no security vulnerabilities, and the code is purely definitional, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The assigned risk scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - All reports assign malware score = 0.\n   - This is correct; no malicious behavior is present.\n   - No change needed.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent across reports.\n   - The assessments align with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Overall, the code is a simple, standard definition of custom exception classes with no malicious or security issues.**  \n**The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified.**\n\n### My Own Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments, confirming that the code is benign and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
