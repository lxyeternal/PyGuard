  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for credential and connection errors related to PyData operations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings, which do not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; these are simply exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard exception types. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious behavior. The docstrings clarify intended use but do not involve any malicious or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign definition of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks.",
