  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for credential and connection errors in a data-related Python application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings, no input reading or data fetching present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output, no potential data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "None, as no data flow or untrusted input is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of class definitions with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python error types. These classes are straightforward, with no executable logic, data handling, or external communications. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple class definitions for exception handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard, clean, and safe.",
