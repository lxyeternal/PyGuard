  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for credential and connection errors related to PyData operations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely declares classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions, each with descriptive docstrings. There are no data inputs, external calls, or security-sensitive operations. The code appears to serve as part of a larger error handling framework. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, defining exception classes with descriptive comments. There are no indications of malicious intent or security issues in this fragment.",
