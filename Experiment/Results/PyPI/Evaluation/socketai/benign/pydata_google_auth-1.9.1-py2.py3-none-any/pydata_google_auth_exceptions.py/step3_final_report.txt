  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for credential and connection errors in Python.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are only class definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two custom exception class definitions inheriting from standard Python exceptions, with no input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code is simple, clear, and standard, with no signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for defining custom exceptions. It poses no security risks, contains no malicious behavior, and is free of obfuscation. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified.",
