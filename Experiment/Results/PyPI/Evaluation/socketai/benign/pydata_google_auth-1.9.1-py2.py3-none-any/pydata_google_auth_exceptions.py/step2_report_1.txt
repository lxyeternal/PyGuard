  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only defines two custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions, with descriptive docstrings.\n   - No input handling, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are observed.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign and straightforward; no issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - **Conclusion:** The reports are well-reasoned and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign `securityRisk` and `malware` scores of 0, and the code is purely definitional, higher scores are unwarranted.\n   - **Conclusion:** No justification for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the actual code content.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely definitional.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis provided.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Justification:**\nThe code is a simple, standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python. It does not include any malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive elements. The reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- I agree with the provided assessments.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n- The code poses no security risk.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- No further action required.",
