  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for credential and connection errors in a Python package related to data handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings, which do not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as these are just exception class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python error classes, with descriptive docstrings. No input/output handling, external data processing, or suspicious behavior observed. The structure is straightforward and typical for error handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional for exception handling with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be standard, benign code.",
