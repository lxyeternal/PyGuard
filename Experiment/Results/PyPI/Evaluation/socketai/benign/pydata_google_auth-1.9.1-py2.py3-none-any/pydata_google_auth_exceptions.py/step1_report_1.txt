  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for credential and connection errors related to PyData operations.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their docstrings; no input or data reading in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or processing occurs in this code segment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code only defines exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions, with descriptive docstrings. There are no input handling, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The classes serve as specific error types for credential and connection issues, which is standard practice. No malicious patterns or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign definition of custom exceptions for error handling related to PyData credentials and connection problems. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
