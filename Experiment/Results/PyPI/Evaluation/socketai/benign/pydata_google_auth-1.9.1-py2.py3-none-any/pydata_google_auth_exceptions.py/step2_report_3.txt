  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions (`ValueError` and `RuntimeError`).\n   - The reports confirm that these are straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings.\n   - No input handling, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious behavior are identified.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign and purely definitional.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - Since no malicious or risky behavior is observed, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and correctly interpret the code as standard exception class definitions.\n   - No unwarranted security concerns are inferred.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a minimal, safe, and standard pattern for defining custom exceptions.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Personal Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is purely definitional, benign, and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security issues. The current scoring is appropriate.",
