  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of two custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions, with descriptive docstrings. There are no signs of data handling, external communication, or executable logic. Therefore, no issues such as vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves as part of an error handling framework. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Confidence: 1 (high)\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Malware: 0\n   - SecurityRisk: 0\n\n   These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely definitional with no malicious activity, the risk scores are correctly set to zero. Any higher score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate. The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as simple class definitions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a standard, safe, and benign implementation of custom exception classes for error handling. The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear, straightforward class definitions)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk present)\n\nThe code is typical boilerplate for error handling and poses no security threat. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Final note**: The code snippet is safe, and the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.",
