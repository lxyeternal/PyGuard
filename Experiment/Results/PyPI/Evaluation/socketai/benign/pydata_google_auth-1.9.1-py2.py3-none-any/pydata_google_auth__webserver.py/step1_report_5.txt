{
  "purpose": "Helpers for running a local webserver to receive authorization code, mainly for OAuth2 authentication flows.",
  "sources": "Reads no external untrusted input; uses socket binding and port checking functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses socket binding to check port availability; calls app_flow.run_local_server which initiates a local webserver.",
  "flows": "find_open_port checks ports for availability; run_local_server selects a port and starts a local server via app_flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. No data leaks or privacy violations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and primarily focuses on finding open network ports and running a local server for OAuth flows. It uses standard socket operations and library functions for OAuth. No hardcoded secrets or malicious network activities are evident. The port checking and server initiation are typical for local OAuth implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for OAuth authentication. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The logic is standard, with no anomalous behavior.",
