  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Helper functions for OAuth local server setup, using socket port checks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code detected; standard socket operations; no untrusted data processing beyond port checks.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded, high confidence (0.9), no obfuscation, malware, or significant security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard and benign. The security risk score of 0.1 seems appropriate, considering minimal risk from port scanning and server initiation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on port checking and OAuth server startup.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Standard socket probing; no secrets or obfuscation; no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9), no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, given the limited scope and benign intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general function, port checking, and OAuth server launch.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Standard socket use; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct, high confidence (0.9), no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** The report accurately assesses the code as benign, with a low security risk score.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions, with configuration parameters.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (1.0), no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is a typical OAuth helper.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others, port detection and server startup.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-justified, high confidence (0.9), no malware.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly concludes benign intent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, matching the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in all reports, justified by the fact that port scanning and server startup could, in some contexts, be misused if misconfigured. However, in this benign context, this is minimal.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — Code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — Slightly elevated due to port scanning, but justified given the context.\n\n**Final Note:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No changes needed. The code is a standard utility for OAuth local server setup, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
