  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for running a local webserver to receive authorization codes for OAuth flows.",
  "sources": "Reads socket ports and attempts to bind or listen on localhost ports.",
  "sinks": "Potentially uses untrusted port availability checks to open a server for OAuth callback, but no untrusted data is directly processed.",
  "flows": "Checks port availability (source) to open a local server (sink) for OAuth flow callback.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Uses standard socket operations and a common OAuth pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs port scanning on localhost to find an available port, then runs a local server for OAuth authorization flows using the 'app_flow' parameter. It uses standard socket operations and exception handling. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or privacy violations are evident. It does not process untrusted user input beyond port checking, and all network interactions are limited to localhost. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious external communications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard helper for OAuth local server setup, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured and uses common practices.",
