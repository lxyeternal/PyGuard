  "purpose": "Helpers for running a local webserver to receive authorization code for Google authentication.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters for port selection and user credentials from the OAuth flow object.",
  "sinks": "The run_local_server function initiates a local web server which listens on an open port; potential sink for malicious input is the OAuth flow's run_local_server method.",
  "flows": "Source: find_open_port() checks for available ports; sink: app_flow.run_local_server() starts a server on the selected port; flow: port detection -> server startup.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard socket operations for port detection, no suspicious hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or unusual network behavior. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script provides utility functions to find open ports and start a local OAuth authorization server. It employs common socket programming patterns, avoids hardcoded sensitive data, and relies on standard libraries and functions. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or privacy violations. The OAuth flow is used as intended for authentication, not for exfiltration or unauthorized access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of local server setup for OAuth authentication, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It is a typical utility script for OAuth-based workflows.",
