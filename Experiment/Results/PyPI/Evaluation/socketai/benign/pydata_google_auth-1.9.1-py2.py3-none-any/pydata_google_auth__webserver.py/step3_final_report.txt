  "purpose": "Helper functions for port detection and running a local OAuth authorization server.",
  "sources": "Socket binding operations for port checking, OAuth flow initiation via run_local_server.",
  "sinks": "None; operations are limited to localhost and do not process untrusted data beyond port checks.",
  "flows": "Port checking via socket.bind() leading to server startup with run_local_server.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard socket usage and OAuth flow.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard port scanning on localhost using socket binding, then initiates an OAuth local server. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity are present. The socket operations are typical for port detection, and the OAuth flow uses well-established library calls. The minimal security risk score (~0.1) reflects the low inherent risk of port scanning and server startup confined to localhost. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for OAuth local server setup, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
