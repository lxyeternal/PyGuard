  "purpose": "Helpers for running a local webserver to receive authorization code for OAuth2 flows.",
  "sources": "Reads data from socket connections to check port status and to bind sockets for port checking.",
  "sinks": "Uses app_flow.run_local_server() which starts a local server and handles OAuth flow; potential for network interactions.",
  "flows": "Checks ports via socket binding, then if open, runs OAuth flow server on open port.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; socket checks are standard. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs port checking and runs a local server for OAuth authorization. It uses socket operations to identify open ports and then launches a server with provided OAuth flow. No malicious behavior or suspicious data leaks are evident. The socket binding for port checking is a typical technique. The OAuth server invocation is standard for authentication workflows. No hidden network communications or data exfiltration observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of local port checking and OAuth server initiation, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. It leverages standard libraries and patterns for OAuth2 workflows.",
