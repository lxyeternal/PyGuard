  "purpose": "Helpers for running a local webserver to receive authorization code for OAuth authentication.",
  "sources": "socket.socket() for checking port availability; app_flow.run_local_server() for starting the local server.",
  "sinks": "app_flow.run_local_server() initiates a server that listens on a port; potential data exposure if untrusted data is processed improperly during OAuth flow.",
  "flows": "is_port_open() checks port status; find_open_port() searches for open ports; run_local_server() starts the OAuth server on an open port.",
  "anomalies": "Use of socket to probe port availability is standard; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no unusual network activity or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard socket programming techniques to identify open ports on localhost, then runs a local web server for OAuth authentication via the provided app_flow object. It includes typical exception handling and logic for port scanning and server startup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code appears to be a utility for OAuth login flows, which is common and expected in such contexts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate utility for running a local OAuth server and does not contain malicious behavior. It securely checks port availability and initiates the OAuth process on an open port, with proper error handling. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
