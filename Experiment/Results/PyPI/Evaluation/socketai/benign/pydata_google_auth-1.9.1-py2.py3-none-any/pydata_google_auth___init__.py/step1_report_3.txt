{
  "purpose": "This code provides module-level imports, version information, and exposes functions related to Google API credentials management, serving as a package interface.",
  "sources": "Imports from .auth and ._version modules, get_versions() call, and version assignment statements.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or handle sensitive data directly within this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions or outputs; the code primarily assigns static values and exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code constructs are present. The version retrieval and module exports are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions related to authentication and version info, retrieves version details via get_versions(), and assigns version identifiers. It sets module exports accordingly. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, untrusted data handling, or suspicious patterns. It appears to be boilerplate module setup code, typical for Python packages providing API credential helpers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, mainly dealing with module setup and versioning without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process user input or sensitive data directly. No malware or security issues are evident.",
