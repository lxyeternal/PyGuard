{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface for managing Google API credentials, providing functions to load, save, and retrieve user and service account credentials, and also version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.auth and ._version), and the get_versions() function call.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code itself does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves version information via get_versions(), then assigns version and revision data to module-level variables. No flow from external input to sensitive functions or data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The only potential concern is reliance on external version info, but that appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports credential management functions and version retrieval functions, then sets version variables. The purpose appears to be to expose these functionalities publicly. There are no input handling, no data processing, and no external network interactions. All functions seem to be related to credential management and version info, with no signs of malicious behavior or data leakage. The code structure is straightforward and aligns with standard package metadata and credential interface patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for credential management and version info retrieval, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
