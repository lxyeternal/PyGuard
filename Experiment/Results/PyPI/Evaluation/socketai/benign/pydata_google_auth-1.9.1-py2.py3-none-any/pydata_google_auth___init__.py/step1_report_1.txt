  "purpose": "This module provides helper functions for managing Google API credentials, including loading, saving, and retrieving credentials, as well as version information.",
  "sources": "Imports from .auth and ._version modules; get_versions function call",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external communication detected",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow indicative of malicious activity; the code primarily loads functions and assigns version info",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns; the code is straightforward and typical for a credentials management module",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions related to credential management and versioning from local modules, retrieves version info, and exposes certain variables and functions via __all__. There are no indications of data exfiltration, code injection, or other malicious behavior. The purpose aligns with standard credential handling practices, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard credentials helper module with no malicious intent or security risks. It only manages credential functions and version info, with no external communications or sensitive data handling evident.",
