  "purpose": "Provides helpers for fetching Google API credentials and version information.",
  "sources": "Calls to get_versions(), imports from .auth and ._version modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data flow, network communication, or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Retrieval of version info, assignment to variables, exposure via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup, importing credential functions and version info, then exposing them. It contains no external network calls, no data processing of untrusted input, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The version info is retrieved via get_versions(), and no secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be boilerplate for a package's __init__.py or main module, with a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for a credentials helper package, with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1) due to reliance on external modules, but no issues are evident.",
