  "purpose": "To parse and return version information from a JSON string containing metadata about the source code or distribution.",
  "sources": "The variable 'version_json' which contains a JSON string with version details.",
  "sinks": "The 'json.loads' function which deserializes the JSON string into a Python dictionary.",
  "flows": "The 'version_json' string flows into 'json.loads', producing a dictionary as output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the JSON string appears static and standard, generated by a versioning tool.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a JSON string with version metadata, including date, revision ID, and version number. The 'get_versions' function simply deserializes this static JSON string. The JSON appears to be generated by a version control system or build process, with no dynamic input or external data dependencies. No obfuscated code, hidden behavior, or malicious patterns are present. The code performs a straightforward deserialization of version info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for retrieving static version metadata. It does not contain malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code flows.",
