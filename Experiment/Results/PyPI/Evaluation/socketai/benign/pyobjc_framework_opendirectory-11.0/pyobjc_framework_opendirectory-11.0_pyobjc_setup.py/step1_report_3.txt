{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup procedures for building and testing the PyObjC framework wrappers, including custom build commands, environment setup, and test suite execution.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (e.g., CFLAGS, PATH), subprocess outputs (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), file system (SDK plist, headers, test files), and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess commands for system info, SDK detection, compiler invocation, and file reading/writing for build info and headers.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → subprocess calls → file reads/writes → build configurations → test execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed. The code uses subprocess calls to system tools without validation, which could potentially be misused if environment variables or system state are manipulated. No obfuscation or intentionally misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly handles setup, environment detection, and testing procedures for building PyObjC extensions. It invokes system commands (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), reads configuration files, and manipulates sys.path and environment variables to prepare the build environment. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors. The subprocess usage is standard for environment detection, and no suspicious network activity or code injection techniques are present. The code's behavior aligns with typical build tooling for macOS development. Potential risks could arise if environment variables are maliciously set, but within this script, such risks are incidental and typical of build scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard build and test setup script for the PyObjC framework with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It interacts with system tools and file system in a typical manner, focusing on environment detection and test execution. No malware or malicious behavior is detected.",
