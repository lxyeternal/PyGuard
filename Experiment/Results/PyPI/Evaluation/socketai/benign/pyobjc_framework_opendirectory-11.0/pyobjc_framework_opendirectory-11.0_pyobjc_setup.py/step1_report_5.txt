{
  "purpose": "This script defines setup and build configurations for the PyObjC framework, including custom build commands, test execution, and packaging logic.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, subprocess outputs, file system operations, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls (e.g., sw_vers, clang), file writes (e.g., pyobjc-build-info.txt, PKG-INFO), dynamic import of test modules, sys.path modifications.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and subprocess outputs influence compiler settings and SDK detection. File system and subprocess operations determine build info. Test commands modify sys.path and run unittests.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to invoke system commands (sw_vers, clang, xcrun) for info collection. Dynamic modifications to sys.path and sys.modules for testing. Writing build info and metadata files. No obvious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs system introspection via subprocess, modifies build configurations, and manages test execution environments. These actions are typical for build scripts. No signs of malicious intent like data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or code designed to harm the system. The subprocess commands are standard for collecting system info; file writes are related to build metadata. Dynamic import and sys.path modifications are for test setup. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard build and test setup script for PyObjC with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs system info collection, build configuration, and testing orchestration typical for a complex Python package. No malware signals or security risks are evident.",
