  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build and test automation script with no malicious intent or sabotage. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The security risk score of 0.2 is reasonable, representing a minimal, typical risk level for build scripts relying on subprocess calls and environment variables. Overall, the script poses very low security risk and functions as expected for its purpose."
