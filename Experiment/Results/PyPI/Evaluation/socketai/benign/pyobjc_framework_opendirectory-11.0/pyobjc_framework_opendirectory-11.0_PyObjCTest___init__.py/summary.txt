  "conclusion": "The assessments and scores are generally well-justified and consistent with the provided descriptions. Benign code is appropriately scored as low risk, while suspicious code with dynamic execution, obfuscation, and network anomalies justifies higher scores. Final scores for the suspicious code should be confirmed with actual code review; otherwise, they are reasonable estimates based on the summaries."
