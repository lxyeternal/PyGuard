{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user input functions, and file reads.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are network connections, file writes, and subprocess executions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to sinks such as network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscated code detected. No unusual dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors evident. Code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code reads inputs from environment variables, user input prompts, and files. It processes data through standard functions and outputs to files or network sockets. No suspicious or malicious patterns observed, such as data exfiltration or system compromise mechanisms. Usage of third-party libraries is conventional. No embedded malware, backdoors, or unauthorized system manipulations are present. The code is clear and appears benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. It appears to be a normal utility script without malicious intent.",
