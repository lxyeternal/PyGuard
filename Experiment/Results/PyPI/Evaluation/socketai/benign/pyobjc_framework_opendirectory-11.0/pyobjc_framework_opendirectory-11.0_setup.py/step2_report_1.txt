  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Vulnerable Code:**\n   - The provided code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package (`pyobjc-framework-OpenDirectory`). It primarily defines package metadata and dependencies.\n   - There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior within this script.\n   - The code does not include any network operations, dynamic code execution, or other typical indicators of malware.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Summary:**\n   - All reports are marked as \"Empty response\" with no raw response data. This suggests that the reports lack substantive content.\n   - Without detailed reports, it's impossible to identify specific vulnerabilities, malware, or issues.\n   - The absence of details makes it difficult to assess any potential security concerns.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - Since no concrete issues are reported, the malware score should be **0**.\n   - The obfuscated score should also be **0**, given the lack of obfuscation or suspicious code.\n   - The risk score, reflecting overall security risk, should be **0** or very close to it, as there's no evidence of vulnerability or malicious activity.\n\n4. **Potential Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - Any claims that this code is malicious or vulnerable without supporting evidence are unfounded.\n   - The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for a Python framework wrapper.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - Given the lack of data, assigning high scores would be unreasonable.\n   - The scores should reflect the absence of issues: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n\n### Summary:\nBased on the provided code and the empty reports, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports do not provide any actionable information. Therefore, the scores should be minimal, indicating no security concerns.\n\nPlease ensure future reports include detailed findings for a more thorough review.",
