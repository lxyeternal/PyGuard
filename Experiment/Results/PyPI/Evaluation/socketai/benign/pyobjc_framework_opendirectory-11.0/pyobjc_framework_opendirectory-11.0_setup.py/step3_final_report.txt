  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'pyobjc-framework-OpenDirectory' package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Standard imports, os and sys modules, and the __doc__ string for description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; code primarily initializes package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward package setup with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple setup script for a Python package wrapping macOS frameworks. It imports standard modules, modifies sys.path, and calls setup() with static parameters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The provided reports are empty, indicating no identified issues or vulnerabilities. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. Given the absence of any suspicious activity or vulnerabilities, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The empty reports do not provide any evidence of vulnerabilities or malware. Therefore, the malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is 0.",
