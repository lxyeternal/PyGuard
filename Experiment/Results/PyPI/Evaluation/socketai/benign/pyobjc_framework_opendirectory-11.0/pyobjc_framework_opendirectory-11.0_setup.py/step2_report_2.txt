  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports systematically.\n\n1. Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code:\n- The reports contain only \"Empty response\" errors with no detailed information. Therefore, there's no specific vulnerability, flaw, or malicious activity described in these reports to evaluate.\n\n2. Identify and record any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary:\n- Since the reports lack content, there are no errors or flaws to identify within the reports themselves.\n\n3. Review the scores given to each issue:\n- No scores are provided, only empty responses. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. Justify any risk score higher than 0.5:\n- No issues are described, so assigning a high risk score isn't justified.\n\n5. Pay close attention to the malware score:\n- No malware activity or suspicious behavior is indicated in the reports.\n\n6. Challenge any claims about potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- Without detailed information, any assumptions about vulnerabilities would be unfounded.\n\n7. Make sure the scores are consistent with the report:\n- No scores are present, so consistency isn't an issue here.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- The code itself appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package wrapping macOS frameworks.\n- It does not contain any obfuscated code, suspicious imports, or potentially malicious logic.\n- The only potential concern could be the inclusion of the `pyobjc_setup` module, but that is a common dependency for such packages.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are empty and do not provide any information about vulnerabilities, malware, or issues.\n- The code appears standard and benign.\n- No risk or malware scores should be increased based on the current information.\n- If further details are provided, a more thorough review could be conducted.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThis is the most reasonable conclusion given the absence of detailed reports.",
