  "sources": "CFOpenDirectory module, CFOpenDirectory.ODSessionGetTypeID, CFOpenDirectory.ODSessionCreate, CFOpenDirectory.ODSessionCopyNodeNames, CFOpenDirectory.kODSessionDefault",
  "sinks": "assertIsInstance, assertResultIsCFRetained, assertArgIsOut, assertIsInstance (testing assertions, not data flow sinks)",
  "flows": "Input data from module attributes and functions, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; tests invoke methods and verify return types",
  "anomalies": "Code is primarily test assertions for API functions; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior present",
  "analysis": "The code imports a macOS framework binding, performs type assertions, and verifies constants and function behaviors typical in test cases. There are no data leaks, network operations, or malicious patterns. No suspicious dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or backdoors are evident. The code is standard for unit tests of system APIs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward test suite verifying macOS Directory Services API bindings. No malicious activity, security risks, or anomalous behavior detected. The code appears benign and intended solely for testing.",
