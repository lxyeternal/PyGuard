  "purpose": "Unit tests verifying constants and method signatures of the OpenDirectory framework on macOS.",
  "sources": "Constants and method signatures within the OpenDirectory module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs, network calls, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "N/A - static API validation, no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward API validation with no suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code is a static set of unit tests for API constants and method signatures, with no external inputs, network activity, or malicious logic. All signals indicate benign, standard API validation code. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign API validation suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
