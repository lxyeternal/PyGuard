      "conclusion": "The code is a benign runtime type enforcement utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only technical concern is its dependence on internal 'typing' APIs, which could affect compatibility but not security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to internal API usage, which is justified as a minor compatibility issue rather than a security threat."
