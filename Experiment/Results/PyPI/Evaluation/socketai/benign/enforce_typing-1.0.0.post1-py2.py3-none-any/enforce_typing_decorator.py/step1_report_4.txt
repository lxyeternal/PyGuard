{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator function 'enforce_types' that enforces type annotations at runtime for functions and class constructors.",
  "sources": "The code reads function arguments and class constructor arguments using 'inspect.getfullargspec' and input parameters passed to functions or constructors.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; the code performs type checking only.",
  "flows": "Source: Function or constructor arguments → Type verification in 'check_types' → No data output or transfer to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Uses private typing attributes like '_SpecialForm' which are internal and unstable; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a runtime type enforcement decorator, inspecting function signatures and annotations, then checking argument types before calling the wrapped function. It supports class constructors by replacing '__init__' with a decorated version. The use of 'suppress' indicates suppression of KeyErrors during annotation access, which is safe in this context. No external data transfer, malicious logic, or obfuscation detected. The code appears to be a standard implementation of type enforcement with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard runtime type checker decorator with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or data leaks, and its structure is straightforward and conventional.",
