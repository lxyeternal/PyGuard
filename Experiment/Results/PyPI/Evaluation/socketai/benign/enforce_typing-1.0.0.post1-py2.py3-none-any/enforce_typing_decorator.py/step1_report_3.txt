{
  "purpose": "The code implements a decorator to enforce type checking on function parameters, including class constructors, at runtime.",
  "sources": "The code reads function arguments, class constructors, and type annotations via inspect.getfullargspec.",
  "sinks": "Type checks and exception raising occur within the check_types function; no data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are checked against type annotations before function execution; type enforcement occurs via raising TypeError if mismatched.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses internal attributes of typing module (like _SpecialForm), which are non-public and potentially unstable; no malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'enforce_types' that retrieves function or class constructor parameter annotations. It then defines a 'check_types' function that verifies argument types against annotations, skipping special forms. The decorator wraps the target function or constructor to perform type checks before execution. No external data is read beyond standard argument inspection. No malicious intent or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward, focusing solely on type enforcement without hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard runtime type enforcement decorator with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It performs input validation without external data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
