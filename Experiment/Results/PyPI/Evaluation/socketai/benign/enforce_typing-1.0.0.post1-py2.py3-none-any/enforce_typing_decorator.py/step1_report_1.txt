{
  "purpose": "The code implements a decorator to enforce type annotations at runtime for functions and class constructors.",
  "sources": "The code reads function arguments and class constructors via 'inspect.getfullargspec' and the wrapped function's arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include raising TypeError if type mismatches are detected. No other sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function arguments into 'check_types', which validates types and may raise errors; no other data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses 'typing._SpecialForm' which is an internal, private API, potentially leading to compatibility issues. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines 'enforce_types' decorator that inspects the type annotations of functions or class constructors. It validates argument types at runtime, raising TypeError if mismatched. It uses 'inspect.getfullargspec' to retrieve parameter info and 'typing' module internals to handle type hints. The decorator modifies class __init__ methods to enforce types during object creation. The implementation appears focused solely on type enforcement without malicious behavior, and no external network, file access, or system modification code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a runtime type enforcement decorator without any signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not access external resources or perform any harmful actions. It is a standard utility for type checking.",
