{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator to enforce function and method argument types at runtime based on type annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads function arguments and type annotations from inspect.getfullargspec and spec.annotations.",
  "sinks": "The code raises TypeError if argument types do not match annotations, but does not have sinks that process untrusted data for security impacts.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into check_types, which validates their types against annotations; no external data or untrusted sources are processed or sent elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code performs standard type checking logic. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'enforce_types' that uses inspect to retrieve function or class __init__ argument annotations. It wraps functions or class constructors to enforce type checking at runtime, raising TypeError on mismatches. No external data inputs, network calls, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be a standard type enforcement utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard runtime type enforcement utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply checks argument types against annotations and raises errors if mismatched. There are no suspicious or malicious activities detected.",
