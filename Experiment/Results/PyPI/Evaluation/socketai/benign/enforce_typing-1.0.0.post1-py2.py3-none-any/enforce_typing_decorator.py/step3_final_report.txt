{
  "purpose": "A runtime decorator enforcing type annotations on functions and class constructors to ensure arguments match specified types during execution.",
  "sources": "Function arguments and class constructor parameters accessed via inspect.getfullargspec and annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data flow, network activity, or data exfiltration points detected.",
  "flows": "Function or constructor arguments (sources) are checked against annotations; mismatches raise TypeError, but no external sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal 'typing._SpecialForm' attributes, which are non-public and may cause compatibility issues but are not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward runtime type enforcement decorator, inspecting function signatures and replacing class __init__ methods. It performs type checks using isinstance, handling special typing forms. No external resource access, network activity, or malicious code is present. The reliance on internal 'typing' APIs is a minor concern but does not indicate malicious intent. The code is clear, well-structured, and purpose-specific, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign runtime type enforcement utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only technical concern is its dependence on internal 'typing' APIs, which could affect compatibility but not security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to internal API usage, which is justified as a minor compatibility issue rather than a security threat.",
