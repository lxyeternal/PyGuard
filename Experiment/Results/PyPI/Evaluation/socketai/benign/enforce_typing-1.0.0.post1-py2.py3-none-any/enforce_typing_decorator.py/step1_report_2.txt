{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator to enforce type annotations at runtime for functions and class constructors.",
  "sources": "The code reads function arguments, class constructors, and type annotations using inspect.getfullargspec and related introspection functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or sent; the code only performs type checks and raises errors.",
  "flows": "Input arguments and their annotations flow into type checking logic, which then either passes or raises errors based on type conformity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code performs standard runtime type enforcement; no obfuscated or malicious code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a runtime type enforcement decorator using Python's introspection capabilities. It inspects function signatures and annotations, then enforces type checks before function execution. The approach is typical and does not include any malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no external data sources, network activity, or storage operations. No anomalies such as hidden backdoors or data leaks are apparent. The code appears safe and standard for runtime type enforcement.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard runtime type enforcement decorator with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns and operates solely for type checking. Overall security risk is negligible.",
