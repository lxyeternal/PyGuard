  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the details.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple module that defines a static version string and a function to retrieve it.\n- The only notable anomaly across reports is the import of `enforce_types`, which is unused in the snippet.\n- No reports mention any dynamic data, user input, or external data sources.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration are detected.\n- The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the description; it defines a version string and a getter function.\n- **Malware presence:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code clarity.\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Flaws or logical errors:\n- The import of `enforce_types` is unused in this snippet. While not malicious, it might suggest incomplete code or unused dependencies, but this is benign.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- The scores for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are consistent with the code content.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The import of `enforce_types` is unnecessary here but not harmful. It might be a minor code smell if it indicates unused dependencies, but not a security concern.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities are made; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of this code, I would agree with the current scores. No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident, and the code serves a basic version management purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code is benign, with no security risks or malware detected.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.** The code is safe and standard for version management.",
