  "purpose": "The code provides a function to retrieve the version number of the package.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ variable defined at the top of the file.",
  "sinks": "The get_version() function returns the version string; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input source (__version__) flows into get_version() and is returned as output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The import statement is standard, and the version string appears to be a normal semantic version.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports a decorator (unused in this snippet), defines a version string, and provides a function to return that string. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations. The import may suggest additional functionality elsewhere, but in this snippet, it’s harmless. No security issues or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines a version string and a function to retrieve it. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The import statement is unused here but not suspicious. Overall, this appears to be benign version management code.",
