  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is minimal, defining a static version string and a function to retrieve it.\n- The import of `enforce_types` from a local module is present but unused in this snippet.\n- No external input, untrusted data, or dynamic behavior is involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate for version management within a package.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code?**  \n  No. The code matches the description, and no malicious or suspicious elements are present.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The only noteworthy point is the unused import `enforce_types`. While not a security flaw, it could be considered unnecessary clutter or a minor oversight. It does not impact security or functionality in this snippet.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports — appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports — appropriate, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0 in all reports — justified given the simplicity and benign nature.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports consistently assign a malware score of 0, which is correct.\n- The confidence level is high (mostly 1), which is justified.\n- The only anomaly is the unused import, but it is benign.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is straightforward, benign, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The import of `enforce_types` is unused but not suspicious.\n- The version string is static and not influenced by external sources.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis is a standard, benign version management snippet with no security concerns. The only minor note is the unused import, which does not impact security or functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0. No changes necessary.",
