{
  "purpose": "The code defines a module with a version string and a function to return that version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ variable, which is assigned a static string. It also imports 'enforce_types' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the function simply returns a static string.",
  "anomalies": "The import of 'enforce_types' suggests possible type enforcement, but it is unused in this snippet. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a potentially relevant decorator but does not utilize it, which could be an oversight or placeholder. The version string is static and used in a straightforward manner. No user input, external data, or suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to serve a basic versioning purpose without any malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is simple, standard, and contains no malicious behavior. The import of 'enforce_types' is unused, but this does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign.",
