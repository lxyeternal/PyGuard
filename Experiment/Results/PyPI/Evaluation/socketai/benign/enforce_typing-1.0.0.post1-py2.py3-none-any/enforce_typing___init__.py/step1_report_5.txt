{
  "purpose": "The code defines a module with a version string and a function to retrieve that version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ variable and imports enforce_types from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The get_version() function returns the __version__ variable; no data flow involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement imports enforce_types but does not use it, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it defines a version string and provides a function to access it. The import of enforce_types is unused, which could be considered a minor anomaly, but it does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of code obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be part of a package setup or version management module.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign module that provides version information. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security concerns are detected.",
