  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is minimal, defining a static version string and a function to retrieve it.\n- It imports `enforce_types` but does not use it.\n- No external input, user data, or untrusted sources are involved.\n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The import of `enforce_types` is unused but not suspicious; it could be part of a larger codebase.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is straightforward.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification for scores:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no security risk.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Static version string, no external input, no suspicious code.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, the import is unused but harmless.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior; the unused import is benign.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent; the import is unused but not suspicious.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The import of `enforce_types` is unused in all snippets. While unusual, this is common in boilerplate code or larger modules where the decorator might be used elsewhere.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or supply chain vulnerabilities are detected.\n- The code is a standard version utility snippet, typical in many packages.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No further action or increased risk scores are warranted.",
