{
  "purpose": "Provides a static version string and a getter function for version retrieval.",
  "sources": "The __version__ variable is read by get_version(). No external input or data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks are present; the code only returns a static string.",
  "flows": "The get_version() function returns the value of __version__, which is a static string; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The import of enforce_types from a local module is unused; no other anomalies or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, defining a static version string and a function to retrieve it. The import of enforce_types is unused but harmless. No external input, dynamic behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The version string is hardcoded and not influenced by external sources. The code serves as a simple version management utility within a package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or security concerns. The unused import does not impact security or functionality. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's nature.",
