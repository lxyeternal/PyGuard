  "purpose": "Defines a version string and provides a function to retrieve it.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ variable and imports 'enforce_types' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The function get_version() returns the __version__ variable without any external input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Import of 'enforce_types' from a local module; no usage of this imported function or indication of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a static version string and defines a simple accessor function. The import statement could be relevant if enforce_types is used elsewhere, but within this snippet, it does not affect execution. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage are present. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It includes a harmless import that is unused in this snippet, but nothing suspicious is detected.",
