{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a module version and provides a function to retrieve it, likely part of a larger package. It also imports a decorator for type enforcement, possibly used elsewhere.",
  "sources": "The only source of data input is the imported 'enforce_types' decorator, which could modify functions but is not used in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this snippet; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this minimal code fragment, as no functions are invoked with parameters or handle external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The import and version string are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a decorator, defines a version string, and provides a function to retrieve this version. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The imported decorator is not used here, which is benign but could suggest its use elsewhere in the larger package. The version string and function are typical in package modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard package boilerplate with no indications of malicious intent or security risks based on this fragment.",
