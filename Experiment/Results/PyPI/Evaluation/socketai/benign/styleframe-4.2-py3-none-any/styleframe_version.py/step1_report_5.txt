{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves and formats version information for Python, pandas, openpyxl, and a style frame version.",
  "sources": "sys module for Python version, pandas and openpyxl modules for respective versions, and string formatting for output.",
  "sinks": "Return statement that outputs version information; no data leakage or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "The version retrieval functions are called and their outputs are formatted into a single string, then returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward without suspicious logic or hardcoded secrets. The variable '_version_' is set with a string value, but this is standard versioning info.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to get versions of Python, pandas, and openpyxl. It then assigns version strings to variables, and finally constructs a combined version information string. There are no external data inputs, no use of untrusted sources, no suspicious or obfuscated code. All imports are standard for version checks. No network activity, no data exfiltration, and no malicious commands are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign version reporting utility. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and intended solely for version information display.",
