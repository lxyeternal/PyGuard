  "purpose": "Retrieve and display versions of Python, pandas, openpyxl, and a style framework version.",
  "sources": "Reading modules (__version__ attributes), importing sys and specific libraries.",
  "sinks": "Returning formatted version strings, no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Functions read version info and return formatted strings; main code constructs a version summary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. The variable naming is slightly inconsistent but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to obtain version information of Python and specific libraries. It imports modules and retrieves their __version__ attributes, then formats these into strings. The final variable _versions_ concatenates all version info, including a hardcoded version number '4.2'. There is no data flow from untrusted sources, no external network communication, or suspicious file operations. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The only noteworthy point is the use of underscores in variable names, which is a common style but could be checked further, although it does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply collects and formats version information for debugging or logging purposes. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of hardcoded version strings is typical and not suspicious. Overall, the code appears benign.",
