  "purpose": "The code retrieves and formats version information for Python, pandas, openpyxl, and a custom version string.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from sys and imported modules pandas and openpyxl.",
  "sinks": "Formats strings with version information; no sinks involving untrusted data or sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Gather version info from sys and modules, then concatenate into a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a variable '_versions_' before its assignment, leading to a NameError if executed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to retrieve version info from sys and specific modules. The function 'get_all_versions' returns the value of '_versions_', which is constructed after its usage in the script. The order of execution causes a NameError because '_versions_' is referenced before assignment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flow. The code is straightforward and intended for version reporting, with no malicious payload or external communication.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple version information collector with a logical error in variable usage. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks, but the current code would raise an exception upon execution. No malware or security threats identified.",
