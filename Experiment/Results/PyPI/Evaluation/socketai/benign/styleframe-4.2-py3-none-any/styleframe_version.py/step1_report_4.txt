{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to retrieve and display version information of Python, pandas, openpyxl, and a custom version string.",
  "sources": "sys.version, pandas.__version__, openpyxl.__version__",
  "sinks": "Return statements generating version info strings",
  "flows": "Input sources (sys.version, pandas.__version__, openpyxl.__version__) to return statements",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; the code simply fetches and formats version info",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to obtain version strings for Python, pandas, and openpyxl using standard library and third-party package attributes. It constructs a composite version string with these details plus a custom version. The code structure is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. The final variable _versions_ consolidates all version info, which is then accessible via the get_all_versions() function. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily used for version reporting. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, nor does it contain malware or security risks.",
