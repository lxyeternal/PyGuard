  "purpose": "Retrieve and format version information for Python, pandas, openpyxl, and a custom style framework version.",
  "sources": "sys.version for Python; pandas.__version__ for pandas; openpyxl.__version__ for openpyxl; hardcoded '4.2' for style framework.",
  "sinks": "Return statement in get_all_versions() outputs the constructed version string.",
  "flows": "Functions get individual versions, then _versions_ is constructed and returned by get_all_versions().",
  "anomalies": "The variable _versions_ is used before assignment, leading to a NameError at runtime.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to fetch version info, then constructs a string _versions_ that includes these versions plus a hardcoded '4.2'. The function get_all_versions() returns _versions_. However, _versions_ is referenced before being assigned, causing a logical bug. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity is present. The main issue is the order of variable assignment, which would cause a runtime error but does not imply malicious intent. The code's purpose is benign, and the only flaw is the variable usage order.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe and intended for version reporting, with a minor logical bug that would cause a runtime error. There is no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores should be malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, reflecting the benign nature and the non-security-related bug.",
