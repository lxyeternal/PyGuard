  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the Styler class from the styleframe library, testing styling features and argument validation.",
  "sources": "Internal class methods, constants from utils module, Styler object instantiations",
  "sinks": "No external data input, output, network activity, or file operations; only internal method calls",
  "flows": "Object creation and comparison within test methods; no external data flow or untrusted input handling",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of internal unit tests for styling functionalities, involving object instantiation, comparison, style combination, and exception handling. No external data sources, network calls, or untrusted inputs are involved. The utils module provides style constants, which are used safely. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard test suite for styling features. There are no indicators of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
