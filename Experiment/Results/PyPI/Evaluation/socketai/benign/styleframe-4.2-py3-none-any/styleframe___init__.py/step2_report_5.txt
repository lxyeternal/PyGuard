  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the accuracy of their findings, scores, and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The code primarily performs module imports, version variable definitions, and a compatibility patch for pandas DataFrame (`applymap` method).  \n- It conditionally imports test modules based on command-line arguments.  \n- No network activity, data leaks, or execution of untrusted code is present.  \n- The monkey-patch for pandas compatibility is a benign workaround, not malicious.  \n- The conditional import of tests is standard practice in development environments.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correctly identifies that the code sets up environment and imports for data manipulation and styling.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** No suspicious data flow or sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the pandas monkey-patch, which is benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior, correctly interprets the code's benign nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. The low security risk score reflects the minor patch, which isn't malicious.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, correctly describes the setup.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, just environment setup and version handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. The report correctly assesses the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar setup description.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes the pandas compatibility hack and the conditional test import.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar description.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Emphasizes the runtime patching of pandas DataFrame, which is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. The patch is a compatibility fix, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same general purpose.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as setup with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of All Reports**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily setup and compatibility handling.\n- The monkey-patch for pandas is benign and not malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The conditional import of tests based on `sys.argv` is standard in testing environments.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low, given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Assessment & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should be **0** for all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly 0; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, a maximum of 0.1 is reasonable, but could be lowered to 0 since there's no security concern.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0** (since no security risk is evident)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a benign setup script with a compatibility workaround, and there are no signs of malicious activity. The scores are reasonable, and the reasoning is sound.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, with no security risks or malware. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low or zero security risk score.",
