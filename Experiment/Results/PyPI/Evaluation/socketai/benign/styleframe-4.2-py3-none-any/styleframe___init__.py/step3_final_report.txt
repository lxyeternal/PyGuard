{
  "purpose": "The code imports necessary modules, defines version variables, and applies a pandas compatibility patch to support different pandas versions. It also conditionally imports test modules based on command-line arguments, serving as setup and environment configuration for a data styling and Excel handling library.",
  "sources": "Module imports, version variable definitions, and the conditional import of test modules based on sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no system commands, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from module imports and version assignments to the conditional import of test modules, with a runtime patch applied to pandas DataFrame if necessary.",
  "anomalies": "The monkey-patch of pandas DataFrame (adding 'map' attribute if missing) is unusual but a known compatibility workaround; no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward setup code primarily for environment configuration. The pandas monkey-patch is a benign workaround for version compatibility, not malicious. The conditional import of tests based on command-line arguments is standard in testing environments. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not process untrusted input or execute system commands. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are accurate. The low security risk score (~0.1) reflects the minor compatibility patch, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with a minor compatibility workaround. It shows no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores and assessments across reports are consistent and accurate.",
