  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of deprecation warning utilities.\n- It uses standard Python modules (`warnings`, `functools`) and common patterns (decorators, warning customization).\n- No external data sources, network activity, or data leaks are involved.\n- The code does not perform any file I/O, process control, or execute external commands.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose is solely to warn users about deprecated function arguments, which is a benign, common practice.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of Malware and Obfuscation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as executing code, exfiltrating data, or connecting to external servers.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 in all reports. The code is clear, well-structured, and readable.\n\n### **Assessment of Security Risk:**\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 in all reports. The code does not introduce vulnerabilities, such as code injection, privilege escalation, or data exposure.\n\n### **Any discrepancies or concerns?**\n\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The logic is consistent, and the reasoning aligns with standard practices.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Additional considerations:**\n\n- The code only issues warnings when deprecated arguments are used; it does not block or alter functionality.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made; the reports correctly identify the code as utility-focused.\n- The consistent high confidence scores (mostly 1, some 0.9) reflect a reliable assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Final evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (clear, readable code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign utility for managing deprecation warnings. It does not pose any security threat, nor does it contain obfuscation or malware. The assigned scores are accurate and justified based on the code’s behavior and purpose.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.",
