{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions for warning formatting and handling deprecated keyword arguments in functions, specifically to warn users about deprecated parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads function arguments via *args and **kwargs within the inner() function.",
  "sinks": "Warnings are issued using warnings.warn(), which could alert the user about deprecated parameters.",
  "flows": "Function receives arguments in inner(), checks for deprecated args, issues warnings if found, then calls the original function with the same arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up custom warning formatting and forcibly always displays DeprecationWarnings. It includes a decorator to mark certain keyword arguments as deprecated, issuing warnings if such arguments are used. The logic is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious data handling. The warnings mechanism is used appropriately for deprecation notices, and no external data sources or sinks are involved beyond standard warning messages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for deprecation warnings, with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be well-structured for its purpose, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
