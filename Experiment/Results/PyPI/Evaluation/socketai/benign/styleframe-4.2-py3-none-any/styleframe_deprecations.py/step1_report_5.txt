{
  "purpose": "This code provides a utility to warn users about deprecated keyword arguments in functions, specifically mapping old argument names to new ones and issuing warnings when deprecated arguments are used.",
  "sources": "The code reads function arguments (kwargs) in the 'inner' function within the 'deprecated_kwargs' decorator.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn function outputs warning messages to the user; no data leaks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Function call with keyword arguments -> check for deprecated kwargs -> issue warning if found.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. The code modifies warning formatting but does not include malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary of deprecated keyword arguments mapping and a decorator that warns if deprecated kwargs are used. It customizes warning formatting. There are no sources of untrusted input from external sources, nor any sinks that send data externally or perform malicious actions. The code's structure is standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for handling deprecated keyword arguments in functions, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It serves a documentation and user notification purpose only.",
