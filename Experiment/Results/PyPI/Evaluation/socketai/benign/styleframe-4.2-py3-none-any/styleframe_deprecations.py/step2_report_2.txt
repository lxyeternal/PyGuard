  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \nThe code defines utility functions for issuing deprecation warnings about outdated keyword arguments in specific functions. It customizes warning formatting, enforces warnings to always be shown, and uses a decorator to check for deprecated arguments, issuing warnings accordingly. The logic is straightforward, with no external data inputs or malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**  \n**Purpose:** Utility for deprecation warnings, no malicious intent.  \n**Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Confidence: 0.9  \n**Analysis:**  \n- The code only issues warnings; no external data flow or malicious activity.  \n- The high confidence score (0.9) is justified because the code is well-understood, benign, and the risk of hidden malicious intent is negligible.  \n- No obfuscation or anomalies detected.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**  \n**Purpose:** Similar utility for deprecation warnings, straightforward.  \n**Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Confidence: 1  \n**Analysis:**  \n- Same reasoning as Report 1; the code is standard and safe.  \n- The maximum confidence score is justified.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**  \n**Purpose:** Same as above, standard deprecation warning utility.  \n**Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Confidence: 1  \n**Analysis:**  \n- No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior.  \n- The code’s simplicity and purpose are clear.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**  \n**Purpose:** Same utility for deprecated argument warnings.  \n**Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Confidence: 1  \n**Analysis:**  \n- Again, standard pattern with no malicious intent.  \n- The code does not perform any network activity, data leaks, or obfuscation.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**  \n**Purpose:** Same as above, handling deprecated kwargs.  \n**Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0, Confidence: 1  \n**Analysis:**  \n- The code is a typical utility for deprecation warnings.  \n- No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.  \n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is correct given the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- **Risk score:** All are 0, reflecting the benign purpose and lack of security concerns.\n\n**Additional considerations:**  \n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.  \n- It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation.  \n- The use of warnings is standard and does not pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.**  \n- **No modifications are necessary.**  \n- **Given the code's benign nature, I would also assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a risk score of 0.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward implementation of deprecation warning utilities with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scoring reflects this accurately.",
