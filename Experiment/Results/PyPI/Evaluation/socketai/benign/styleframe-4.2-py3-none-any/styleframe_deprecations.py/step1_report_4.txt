{
  "purpose": "This code defines utility functions for handling deprecated keyword arguments in Python functions, issuing warnings when deprecated arguments are used, and customizes warning formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads function parameters (kwargs) and imports warnings and functools modules.",
  "sinks": "The code issues warnings via the warnings.warn() function, which can potentially alert users about deprecated arguments.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are checked within the inner() function; if deprecated kwargs are present, a warning is issued; then the original function is called with the provided arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code uses standard Python warning mechanisms and function decorators.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a dictionary for deprecated keyword arguments, defines a custom warning message formatter, and a decorator to warn when deprecated arguments are used in decorated functions. It customizes warning behavior to always show DeprecationWarnings. All operations are standard and do not perform any malicious actions or data leaks. No suspicious or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for deprecation warnings.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign utility code snippet for managing deprecated function arguments and customizing warning output. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
