{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions for issuing deprecation warnings about outdated keyword arguments in certain functions, and customizes warning formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own function definitions and the 'kwargs' parameter during function calls to check for deprecated arguments.",
  "sinks": "Warnings are issued via the 'warnings.warn' function, which can output to logs or console; no data is sent externally or stored maliciously.",
  "flows": "When a function with the 'deprecated_kwargs' decorator is called, it checks for deprecated arguments and issues warnings if found.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and primarily for warning management.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines a custom warning format, and a decorator to warn about deprecated keyword arguments. It uses a predefined mapping 'funcs_to_deprecated_kwargs' for specific functions. No external data inputs or suspicious behaviors are evident. The warnings are localized to the application environment and do not involve network activity, data leakage, or malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for deprecation warnings management, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
