  "purpose": "Utility functions for issuing deprecation warnings about outdated keyword arguments in specific functions.",
  "sources": "Function arguments accessed via kwargs, warnings.warn() calls.",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn() outputs, which notify users but do not cause security issues.",
  "flows": "Checks for deprecated kwargs in function arguments, issues warnings if found, then proceeds with function execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code customizes warning formatting, enforces warnings to always display, and uses a decorator to warn about deprecated kwargs. It relies on a predefined mapping for deprecated argument names. The logic is straightforward, with no external data flows, network activity, or malicious operations. It is a benign utility for deprecation management, with clear, well-structured code. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for managing deprecation warnings in Python. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
