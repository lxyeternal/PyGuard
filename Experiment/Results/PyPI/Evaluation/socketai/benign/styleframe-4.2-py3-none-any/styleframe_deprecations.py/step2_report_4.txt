  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of a decorator for issuing deprecation warnings for function keyword arguments.\n- It customizes warning formatting and enforces warnings to always be shown.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or data exfiltration is involved.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The logic is standard, well-structured, and intended solely for deprecation management.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Utility for deprecation warnings; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is solid. The code is benign, and the score aligns with that.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1; utility for deprecation warnings.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above; deprecation warnings utility.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same utility; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same as others; benign utility.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Analysis:\n\n- **Presence of malware:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All are correctly set to 0, reflecting no security threat.\n- **Confidence levels:** High, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**However, considering the cumulative context:**\n- The code is a standard utility for deprecation warnings.\n- No suspicious patterns or behaviors.\n- No external or malicious data flows.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for any minimal, non-malicious misconfiguration or potential future misuse, but currently none)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis. The overall risk is negligible, and the malware score should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scoring, with malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and risk = 0.1 for safety margin. The code is a standard, safe utility for managing deprecation warnings in Python.",
