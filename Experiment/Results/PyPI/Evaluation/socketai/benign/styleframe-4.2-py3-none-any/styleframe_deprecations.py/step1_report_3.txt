{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions for handling deprecation warnings in Python, specifically for warning about deprecated keyword arguments in functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads function arguments via *args and **kwargs, and accesses a dictionary 'funcs_to_deprecated_kwargs' to determine deprecated parameters.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn function is used to generate deprecation warnings, which are logged or displayed to the user.",
  "flows": "Input: Function arguments (kwargs) -> Check for deprecated keys -> Generate warnings -> Proceed with function execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The code modifies warning formatting and enforces warnings to always be shown.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a custom warning format and a decorator to warn users about deprecated keyword arguments. It references a dictionary for deprecated parameter mappings. The warning mechanism is standard and does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior. No external data sources, network operations, or hidden backdoors are present. The logic is straightforward and aligned with common deprecation warning practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility for managing deprecation warnings in Python functions. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and typical for such purposes.",
