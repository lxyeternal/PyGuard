  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility class for data and style management, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor adjustments could be made to the security risk score in report 4 from 0.2 to 0 for consistency, but overall, the assessments are accurate."
