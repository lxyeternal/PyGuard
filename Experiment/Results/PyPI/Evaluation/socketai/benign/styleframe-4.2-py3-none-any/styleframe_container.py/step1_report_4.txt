{
  "purpose": "Defines a Container class for storing values and associated style information, with comparison and arithmetic operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (datetime), pandas, and a local utils module.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted input handling, network operations, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code appears to be a utility class for data handling and styling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a class with methods for handling values and styles, including comparison and arithmetic operators. It uses standard imports and a local utils module, which likely provides formatting strings. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of pandas and datetime is standard for data manipulation. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or signs of malicious intent. The structure is typical for utility classes in data processing libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility class for data storage and styling, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is safe and does not exhibit signs of supply chain attacks or malware.",
