{
  "purpose": "Defines a container class to store values and associated styles, with comparison and arithmetic operator overloads.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and attributes, uses 'utils.number_formats' for default formatting, reads input via class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data output functions; no network, file, or external data access observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through the class constructor, and various operator overloads process 'value' attributes; no external data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'try-except' for 'pd.Timestamp' compatibility; reliance on 'utils.number_formats' which is imported locally; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a data container class with comparison and arithmetic operator overloads. It imports standard and third-party modules but does not perform any network communication, file access, or system modification. The use of 'utils' and 'styleframe' appears standard for styling or formatting purposes. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or suspicious behavior is evident. The 'try-except' for pandas timestamp is routine compatibility handling. No external data leaks, credential handling, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data container class with styling capabilities, without any malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and not suspicious.",
