  "purpose": "The code provides utility classes and functions for styling Excel cells using openpyxl, including style creation, conversion, and conditional formatting rules.",
  "sources": "Parameters for style attributes, such as colors, fonts, borders, and formatting options; no external data sources or input streams.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; the code does not send data outside the environment or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "Internal style object creation and conversion; no untrusted data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of styling utilities for openpyxl, with functions for creating, combining, and converting styles, as well as applying conditional formatting. It relies on standard library modules and trusted utility modules. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data leaks. The logic is static and predictable, focused solely on styling Excel sheets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for styling Excel files with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
