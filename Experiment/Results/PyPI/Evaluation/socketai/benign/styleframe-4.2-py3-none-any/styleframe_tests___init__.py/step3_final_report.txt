  "purpose": "Constructs a path to a test Excel file within the 'styleframe' package directory for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "sf.__file__ to locate the package directory, os.path.join to build the test file path",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, file I/O, network activity, or data processing occurs",
  "flows": "sf.__file__ → os.path.dirname → os.path.join('tests') → os.path.join(tests_dir, 'styleframe_test.xlsx')",
  "anomalies": "Accessing internal package files for test setup is somewhat unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party library and constructs a file path to a test resource within the package directory. It does not perform any file operations, network activity, or data processing. The use of sf.__file__ to locate the package directory is standard for internal testing scripts. No untrusted input, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. All signals indicate benign intent. The code is straightforward and intended for test setup, with no security risks or malware activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and only constructs a test file path within the package directory. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
