{
  "purpose": "This code defines various constants, format strings, and utility functions related to styling and formatting, likely for spreadsheet or report generation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from optional string parameters in functions (e.g., 'hex_string' in is_hex_color_string) and class attributes accessed via class methods or directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks exist that process untrusted data directly; the code does not perform network operations, file writes, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input to 'is_hex_color_string' flows through a regex match operation. Class attribute access is static and does not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The regex is straightforward, and class attributes are static constants.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides static constants for color codes, fonts, borders, alignments, patterns, and formatting strings, with a utility function to match hexadecimal color strings. No dynamic input handling, no data processing, and no external communications are present. The structure and content appear to be standard for configuration or styling purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of constants and a simple utility function for pattern matching. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, contains no suspicious code, and poses no security threats. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
