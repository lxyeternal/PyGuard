  "purpose": "Constants for styling and a simple regex validation for hex color strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'hex_string' in is_hex_color_string function.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "Input 'hex_string' is matched against HEX_REGEX; no further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static, straightforward, and lacks obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static classes defining constants and a regex validation function. The regex pattern is simple and safe. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network activity is present. The constants are static configuration data. The malware score is correctly zero, indicating no malicious intent. The security risk is negligible, given the lack of external interactions or vulnerabilities. The code's structure and purpose are benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static utility module for styling constants with a simple validation function. It poses no security threat or malware risk. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
