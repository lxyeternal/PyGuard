{
  "purpose": "Define various constant classes and a regex function for use in styling, formatting, and color management in a larger application, likely related to spreadsheet or document styling.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads untrusted input directly; the only function is a regex match that checks if a string matches a hex color pattern.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network, file, or system calls are present. No untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks as no external or untrusted input is processed.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. All classes are static containers for constants with no dynamic or reflective behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining constant values for styling and formatting purposes. The only functional component is a regex-based function to check for hex color strings. There are no input processing, network activities, or data leaks. The regex is straightforward and matches common hex color formats. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. Overall, the code appears to serve as a static configuration or constants module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of constant definitions and a simple regex check function. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is safe to use.",
