      "conclusion": "The code is a typical build orchestration script for a Python package with native dependencies. It does not contain malicious code or payloads. The main security concern stems from reliance on external repositories and command execution without validation, which could be exploited if repositories are compromised. Overall, the script appears benign but warrants supply chain security best practices, such as checksum verification and repository trustworthiness."

      "conclusion": "The script performs dynamic module loading with no evidence of malicious activity. The primary security issue is the unverified extraction of external code, which could be exploited if the tarball is compromised. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.4 due to the unvalidated extraction process."
