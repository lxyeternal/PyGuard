  "conclusion": "The script performs dynamic module loading with no evidence of malicious activity. The primary security issue is the unverified extraction of external code, which could be exploited if the tarball is compromised. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is approximately 0.4 due to the unvalidated extraction process."
