  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, the logic, and the scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a build script that clones repositories, runs CMake, and builds dependencies.\n- **Sinks:** Uses spawn to execute commands like 'git clone', 'cmake', 'rm', 'cp', etc.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, but external repositories are cloned without validation.\n- **Analysis:** The script performs typical build orchestration, relying on external URLs, which could be compromised. No malicious code or payloads are detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build script, with risks mainly from external source trust.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code detected) — reasonable.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear.  \n- Risk: 0.4 — moderate, due to external dependencies.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on cloning from external repositories and building dependencies.\n- No malicious behaviors or payloads are evident.\n- The analysis highlights the potential supply chain risk but no active malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — low, considering the external dependency risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- Focuses on the cloning and building process, with environment variable modifications.\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or exfiltration.\n- Emphasizes that the script is a standard build process.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n- Risk: 0.2 — moderate, due to external sources.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar to previous, with detailed description of cloning, building, and environment modifications.\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- Recognizes the potential supply chain risk but no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.1 — perhaps slightly conservative; no malicious code present.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n- Risk: 0.4 — moderate, considering external dependencies and command execution.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- Similar in scope: cloning repositories, building dependencies, executing commands.\n- No malicious payloads or backdoors are evident.\n- Recognizes the external dependency risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n- Risk: 0.5 — moderate, due to reliance on external repositories and command execution.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily a build orchestration script.\n- No active malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.\n- The main security concern is the reliance on external repositories and execution of system commands without validation, which is typical for build scripts but still poses supply chain risks.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Given the absence of malicious code, backdoors, or payloads, I would assign a **malware score of 0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is clear, so **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Considering the external dependencies and command execution without validation, a **moderate risk of 0.3-0.4** seems appropriate. The current scores of 0.2 to 0.5 are reasonable.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.3** (a balanced moderate risk considering supply chain and command execution)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical build script with external dependencies, executed in a controlled manner. No malicious activity is evident, but the reliance on external repositories and command execution without validation introduces some supply chain risk. The current scores in the reports are consistent with this assessment.",
