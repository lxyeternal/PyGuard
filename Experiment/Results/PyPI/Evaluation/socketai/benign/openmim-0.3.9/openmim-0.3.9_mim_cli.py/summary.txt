  "conclusion": "The main code is not malicious but is insecure due to dynamic execution of external plugin scripts without validation. The risk is primarily supply chain-related, depending on the trustworthiness of plugin files. No obfuscation or malware is present in the core code. The scores should reflect low malware likelihood (0) and high risk (around 0.75), emphasizing the need for safer plugin handling."
