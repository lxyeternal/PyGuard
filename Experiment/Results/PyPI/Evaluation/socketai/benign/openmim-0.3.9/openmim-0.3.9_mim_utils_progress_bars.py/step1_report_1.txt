{
  "purpose": "The code provides a progress bar visualization for downloading data, utilizing the 'rich' library to display progress information during data transfer.",
  "sources": "Input: iterable of bytes chunks; Data size specified by 'size'.",
  "sinks": "None identified that could leak data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "Input iterable -> yield chunks -> progress update during iteration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. The code uses standard library and 'rich' for visualization, with no malicious behavior apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary typing and progress display components, defines a function to wrap an iterable of bytes with a progress bar, sets up display columns, and updates progress with each chunk. It appears to be a benign utility for visual feedback during downloads. No suspicious code, external network interactions, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a download progress bar using the 'rich' library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be safe and intended for user experience enhancement.",
