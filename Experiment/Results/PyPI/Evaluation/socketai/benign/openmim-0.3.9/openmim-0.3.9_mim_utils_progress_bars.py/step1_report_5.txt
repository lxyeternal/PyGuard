  "purpose": "Render a progress bar for data download or transfer using the rich library.",
  "sources": "Input iterable of bytes (data chunks) and total size for progress calculation.",
  "sinks": "Update progress display; no data leakage or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Input iterable -> progress update -> yield chunks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard progress bar implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing hints and rich.progress components to display a progress bar during data transfer. It defines a function rich_progress_bar that takes an iterable of bytes and a total size, sets up progress bar columns, and updates the display as chunks are yielded. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity are present. The code appears to be a legitimate utility for visual progress indication during downloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for showing progress during data transfer. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. No security risks identified.",
