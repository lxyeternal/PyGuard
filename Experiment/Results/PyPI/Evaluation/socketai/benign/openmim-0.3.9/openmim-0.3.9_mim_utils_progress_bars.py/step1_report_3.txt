{
  "purpose": "To provide a rich visual progress bar for iterables of bytes, typically used during download operations.",
  "sources": "The iterable parameter which supplies chunks of data during download.",
  "sinks": "The progress bar update mechanism which visually displays progress; no data leaks or untrusted sinks present.",
  "flows": "Iterable data flows from the input to the generator, updating the progress bar without external data interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard libraries and well-known progress visualization methods. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to display a progress bar for byte streams during download. It uses the 'rich' library for visualization, which is common for CLI progress bars. The function receives an iterable of bytes and a total size, then updates the progress bar as chunks are yielded. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code does not interact with external systems beyond displaying progress, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of a download progress bar with no malicious intent or security risks. It uses common libraries and straightforward logic, serving solely for user interface enhancement during data transfer operations.",
