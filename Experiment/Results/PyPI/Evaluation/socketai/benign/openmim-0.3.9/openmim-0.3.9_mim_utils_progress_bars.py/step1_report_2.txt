{
  "purpose": "To provide a visual progress bar during the download of data streams, specifically for displaying download progress in a terminal using the rich library.",
  "sources": "Input iterable of bytes representing chunks of data being downloaded",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that handle untrusted data in a malicious way; it merely updates a progress display based on the size of chunks processed",
  "flows": "Iterable of bytes (source) is iterated over, yielding each chunk and updating the progress bar accordingly",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code uses standard libraries and patterns for progress display. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a progress bar function using the rich library to visualize download progress. It creates a progress object with multiple columns, initiates a task, and iterates over the provided data chunks, updating the progress as it proceeds. All operations are typical for progress display and involve no external network connections, data leaks, or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a progress bar for downloads. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and appears to be safe. It primarily serves a UI/UX purpose.",
