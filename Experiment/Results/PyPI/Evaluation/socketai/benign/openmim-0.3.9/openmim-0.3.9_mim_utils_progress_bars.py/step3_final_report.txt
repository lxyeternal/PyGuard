{
  "purpose": "Provides a progress bar for data download visualization using the 'rich' library.",
  "sources": "Iterable of bytes passed to the generator; progress update calls within the loop.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication; purely visual output.",
  "flows": "Input iterable yields chunks; progress.update called with chunk length; chunks yielded outward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward implementation with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, benign utility for displaying download progress. It uses well-known libraries and patterns, with no external network interactions or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 is a conservative estimate acknowledging that, in theory, such code could be misused if modified maliciously, but as-is, it poses no threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
