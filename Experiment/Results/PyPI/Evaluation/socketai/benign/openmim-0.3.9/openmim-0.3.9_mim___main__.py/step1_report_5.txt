{
  "purpose": "This module serves as an entry point to run a command-line interface (CLI) for the OpenMMLab project, allowing users to execute functionality via the command line.",
  "sources": "The code reads the `__main__` environment to determine if the script is run directly, and imports `cli` from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process or handle untrusted input data directly.",
  "flows": "When executed as the main program, it calls the imported `cli()` function, which presumably handles further processing or input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present; the code is minimal and standard for CLI entry points.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a CLI function and runs it if the script is executed directly. There is no evidence of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or external communications. The code is straightforward and typical for a command-line utility module. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple CLI launcher with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a standard entry point for a larger software package.",
