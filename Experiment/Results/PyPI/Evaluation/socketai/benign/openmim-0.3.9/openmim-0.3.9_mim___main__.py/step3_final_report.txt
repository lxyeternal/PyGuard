{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a CLI entry point that imports and executes the 'cli()' function from a local module when run as the main script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module '.cli' to import 'cli'. It does not process external input directly.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if 'cli()' processes untrusted input, it could lead to security issues, but this cannot be determined from the snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow is: script execution triggers 'cli()' which may process input or perform actions depending on its implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python CLI bootstrap that imports 'cli' and executes it if run as main. All reports agree that the code itself is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security concern hinges on the implementation of 'cli()', which is not provided. The malware scores are consistently 0, and risk scores are very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk. Given the simplicity and clarity, the code appears safe; the main risk depends on 'cli()' behavior. The scores are justified and consistent across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no evidence of malicious or suspicious activity. The overall security posture is very low risk, contingent on the safety of 'cli()'. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
