{
  "purpose": "The code is a simple module that facilitates command-line execution of the 'cli' function from the 'cli' module, likely related to the 'mim' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data directly. It imports a local module and executes a function if run as a script.",
  "sinks": "The 'cli()' function may serve as a command-line interface, potentially processing untrusted user input when executed, but this is typical for CLI scripts.",
  "flows": "When run as a script, the flow is: check if '__name__' == '__main__', then call 'cli()'. There are no other data flows or untrusted data handling in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is minimal and standard for a command-line entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local 'cli' module and executes its 'cli' function if the script is run directly. It serves as an entry point for command-line operations. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The simplicity and conventional structure suggest no malicious intent. The code's security risk is minimal, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward command-line interface bootstrap code with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply delegates execution to a local CLI handler. The overall security risk is negligible.",
