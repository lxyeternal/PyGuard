{
  "purpose": "The module provides a command-line interface for the 'mim' tool, allowing it to be run as a script.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'cli' function from a local module '.cli'.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the 'cli()' function, which is a potential sink if 'cli' executes untrusted code or performs malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The source is the import of 'cli'; the flow proceeds to executing 'cli()' if the script is run directly.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical entry point for a CLI tool, importing a 'cli' function and executing it when run as the main program. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The only potential concern is if 'cli' contains malicious behavior, but that code is not provided here. The code itself is benign and standard for CLI modules.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple, standard CLI entry script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on the implementation of 'cli' in the imported module, which is not available for review. Based solely on this snippet, there are no signs of malware or security issues.",
