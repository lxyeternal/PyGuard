  "conclusion": "The code appears safe and well-structured, with no malicious intent or supply chain attack signals. The minor security concern regarding exec() is a known pattern and not inherently malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, justified by the exec() pattern. Overall, the code is suitable for production use with standard precautions."
