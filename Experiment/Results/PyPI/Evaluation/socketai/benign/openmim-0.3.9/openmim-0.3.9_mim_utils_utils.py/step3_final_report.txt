  "purpose": "Utility functions for package management, URL parsing, version retrieval, downloading, and configuration handling in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata, executing local version.py files, fetching URLs via requests, reading files from disk, environment variables, and subprocess commands.",
  "sinks": "Execution of code via exec in get_package_version, subprocess calls in call_command, network responses in get_content_from_url, file writes in download_from_file.",
  "flows": "exec() executes local version.py files during get_package_version; requests.get fetches remote content; download_from_file streams data and updates hash; subprocess.check_call runs external commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run local version.py files, which could be risky if files are maliciously crafted; no other unusual or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions for package and dependency management, URL parsing, file downloading, and configuration parsing. The use of exec() in get_package_version is a common pattern to retrieve version info but can be a security concern if the version.py files are compromised. Network interactions are handled with exception handling, and subprocess commands are used cautiously. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The overall structure and purpose are clear and aligned with dependency management tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe and well-structured, with no malicious intent or supply chain attack signals. The minor security concern regarding exec() is a known pattern and not inherently malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, justified by the exec() pattern. Overall, the code is suitable for production use with standard precautions.",
