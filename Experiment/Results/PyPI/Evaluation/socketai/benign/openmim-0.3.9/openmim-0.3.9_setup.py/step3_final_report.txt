  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging, reading static files, parsing requirements, and executing a version file to obtain the package version.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md', 'mim/version.py', and requirements files; executes 'mim/version.py' via exec to get version.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Reads static files; executes 'mim/version.py' with exec; parses requirements; passes data to setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec on 'mim/version.py' could be risky if the file is malicious or tampered with, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts assuming trusted source.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks with static file reads and requirement parsing. The only notable point is the use of exec to evaluate 'version.py', which could execute malicious code if the file is compromised. No network activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward and standard for Python packaging. The risk associated with exec is minimal if the version.py file is maintained securely and trusted. All signals indicate a benign, well-structured setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, trustworthy setup script with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only minor security consideration is the use of exec on 'version.py', which is a common pattern but relies on the trustworthiness of that file. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present.",
