  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the associated scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The script is standard, reading static files, parsing requirements, executing version.py via `exec`, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks identified.  \n- **Justification:** The use of `exec` on version.py is common in setup scripts, assuming the file is trusted. No signs of malicious behavior or external data flow.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, with a note on the `exec` call on version.py.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — minor concern due to `exec`, but within normal expectations if version.py is trusted.  \n- **Justification:** The `exec` on version.py is typical but could be risky if the file is compromised. The report correctly notes this but finds no actual malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; the low risk score reflects a minor concern, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, reading static files, with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward code.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security issues.  \n- **Justification:** Similar to previous reports, the use of `exec` is standard, assuming the version.py is trusted.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Highlights the `exec` on version.py as a potential security concern, noting that if the version file is malicious, it could pose a risk.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected in the code itself.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — reflects the potential risk of executing untrusted code, which is a known concern in such scripts.  \n- **Justification:** Correctly identifies that executing version.py could be risky if compromised, but in normal circumstances, it's standard practice.\n\n**Verdict:** The cautious approach is justified; the risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Confirms that the code is standard, with no suspicious activity, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior.  \n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security issues.  \n- **Justification:** The script is typical for Python packaging, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Malware:** All reports agree there's no malware present. The code is standard for a setup script.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation due to the `exec` on version.py, which is a common but potentially risky pattern if the version file is compromised. The scores of 0.2 reflect this minor concern appropriately.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable given the code's nature.\n- The primary security consideration is the use of `exec` on local files, which is standard but should be trusted.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — due to `exec` on version.py, which is a known pattern but can be risky if the file is compromised.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, well-structured setup script with a minor, acceptable security concern regarding executing the version file. The overall security posture is sound, and the scores reflect that appropriately.",
