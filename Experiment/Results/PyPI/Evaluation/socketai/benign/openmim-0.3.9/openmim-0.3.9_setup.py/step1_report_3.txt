{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package named 'openmim', intended to automate package installation, dependency management, and metadata definition.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md', reading 'mim/version.py', reading requirements files ('requirements/*.txt'), environment variables (Python version check).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; package installation and reading files are standard behaviors.",
  "flows": "Reading version from 'mim/version.py' -> using parsed dependencies from requirements files -> setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution beyond reading files and executing 'version.py' content, which is standard for version retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files ('README.md', 'requirements/*.txt', 'mim/version.py') to gather metadata and dependencies for package setup. The use of 'exec' on 'version.py' is common for dynamic versioning. Dependency parsing strips version info but does not evaluate or execute untrusted code. No network activity, no credential handling, and no suspicious logic is present. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with dependency management and metadata configuration. It does not contain malicious code or security risks based on the provided content.",
