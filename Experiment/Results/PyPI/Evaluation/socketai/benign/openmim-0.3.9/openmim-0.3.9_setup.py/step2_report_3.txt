  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious code, no malicious behavior. The script reads static files, executes version.py via 'exec' assuming it's trusted, and parses requirements normally.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified given the lack of malicious activity.  \n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; no issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the standard nature of the script and acknowledgment that 'exec' on version.py is common but could be risky if the file is malicious.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate, assuming the version.py is trusted.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — justified, since 'exec' on a local file can be a vector if the file is compromised.  \n- **Comments:** The analysis is cautious and reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard setup script, no malicious behavior, with 'exec' on version.py being a common pattern.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified, assuming the version.py is controlled.  \n- **Comments:** Well reasoned.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Identifies the use of 'exec' as a potential security concern if the version file is malicious, which is a valid point.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected, just a potential vector.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — justified, as executing any file can be risky if the file is compromised.  \n- **Comments:** Recognizes the standard pattern but highlights the risk.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Confirms the script is standard, with no suspicious behavior, and emphasizes that all operations are read-only and configuration-oriented.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the overall assessment.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected.  \n- **Use of 'exec' on version.py:** Common in setup scripts, but a potential risk if the version file is compromised. The reports correctly identify this pattern as standard but note its potential risk.  \n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.  \n- **Malware:** Scores are consistently 0 across reports, which seems appropriate given the static, read-only nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.  \n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — slightly elevated due to 'exec' on version.py, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. It should be considered a low, manageable risk assuming the version.py file is trusted.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe setup script appears safe, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The main point of caution is the use of 'exec' to read version.py, which is standard but should be verified that the version.py file is trustworthy. No evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities has been found.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMaintain standard security practices—ensure version.py is stored securely and not tampered with. If desired, replace 'exec' with a safer alternative (e.g., importing the version module directly) to eliminate the execution risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to 'exec' pattern)",
