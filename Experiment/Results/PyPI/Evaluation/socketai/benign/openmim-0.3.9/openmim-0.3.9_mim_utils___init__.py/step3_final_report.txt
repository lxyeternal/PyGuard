{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a utility module that imports constants and functions related to package management, URL handling, and system utilities, then exposes them for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Constants and functions imported from local modules (.default, .progress_bars, .utils), which may read configuration files, URLs, or system info.",
  "sinks": "None in this code snippet; potential sinks could be functions like get_content_from_url, download_from_file, call_command if invoked with untrusted input elsewhere.",
  "flows": "This module imports functions/constants; no data flows or execution occurs here. In usage, external data could flow into functions like get_content_from_url, but not within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static import/export pattern, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module importing various constants and utility functions, then exposing them via __all__. No dynamic execution, data processing, or network activity occurs here. Functions that handle external data are imported but not invoked, minimizing risk. The code structure is standard and clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate given the potential for imported functions to handle external data elsewhere, but in this static context, no risk is present. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0.",
