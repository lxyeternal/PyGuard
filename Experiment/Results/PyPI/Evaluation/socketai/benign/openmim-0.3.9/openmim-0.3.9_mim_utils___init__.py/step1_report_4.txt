{
  "purpose": "This code defines module imports and exports related to a Python project, focusing on configuration, utility functions, and package management.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.default, .progress_bars, .utils) that load functions and constants; no external input reading in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows or harmful actions are executed; no network, file, or environment manipulation appears directly.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks; functions are imported and exposed but not called or executed here.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URL usage, or unusual code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports predefined constants and utility functions, then exports a list of these symbols. All operations are static, with no runtime data handling, network calls, or dynamic code execution observed. The structure aligns with typical package module definitions, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a standard part of a Python package, serving as an interface to various utilities and constants. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this code snippet.",
