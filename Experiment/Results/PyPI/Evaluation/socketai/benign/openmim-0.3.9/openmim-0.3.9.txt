      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, trustworthy setup script with no malicious or obfuscated code. The only minor security consideration is the use of exec on 'version.py', which is a common pattern but relies on the trustworthiness of that file. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present."

      "conclusion": "The main code is not malicious but is insecure due to dynamic execution of external plugin scripts without validation. The risk is primarily supply chain-related, depending on the trustworthiness of plugin files. No obfuscation or malware is present in the core code. The scores should reflect low malware likelihood (0) and high risk (around 0.75), emphasizing the need for safer plugin handling."

The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0."

The minor security concern regarding exec() is a known pattern and not inherently malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, justified by the exec() pattern. Overall, the code is suitable for production use with standard precautions."
