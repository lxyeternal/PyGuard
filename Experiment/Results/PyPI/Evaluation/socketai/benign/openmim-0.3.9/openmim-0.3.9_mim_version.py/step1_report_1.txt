  "purpose": "Define version information for a software package and parse version strings into structured data.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and the input parameter 'version_str' in the parse_version_info function.",
  "sinks": "The output of parse_version_info function, which returns a tuple of version components.",
  "flows": "Input '__version__' is processed by parse_version_info to produce version_info tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code appears to perform straightforward version parsing without unusual constructs or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and defines a function to parse semantic versioning strings, including release candidates. The function splits the version string by periods, converts numeric parts to integers, and handles 'rc' suffixes by splitting and including them as strings. The process is standard and lacks any suspicious behavior, external data access, or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical version parsing utility with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It simply processes version strings into a structured format.",
