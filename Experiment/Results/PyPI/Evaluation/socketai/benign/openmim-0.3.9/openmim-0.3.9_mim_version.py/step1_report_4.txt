{
  "purpose": "To define and parse the version information of the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the string __version__ which is hardcoded as '0.3.9'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or external interactions occur.",
  "flows": "The code flows from reading the hardcoded __version__ string to parsing it into a tuple with potential rc suffix handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard version parsing logic; no unusual or suspicious constructs or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a version string, defines a parsing function that splits the version string by periods, converts numeric parts to integers, and handles release candidate ('rc') suffixes by splitting and appending them as strings. The parsed info is stored in version_info. The code is straightforward, with no external data sources, sinks, or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical version parsing task with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is standard, safe, and transparent.",
