  "purpose": "Parse a version string into a tuple with numeric parts and optional 'rc' suffixes.",
  "sources": "The static variable __version__ and the input string to parse_version_info.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Input string __version__ flows into parse_version_info, which processes and outputs version_info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string parsing with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static version string and a function to parse it into a tuple, handling numeric parts and 'rc' suffixes. It operates solely on static data with no external dependencies, network activity, or obfuscation. The logic is standard and safe. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and risk score of 0, with high confidence. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version parsing utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
