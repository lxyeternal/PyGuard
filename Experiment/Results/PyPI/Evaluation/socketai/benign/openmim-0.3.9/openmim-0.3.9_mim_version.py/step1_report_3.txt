  "purpose": "Parse and process version string information for a software package.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' defined at the top of the code.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks; it only processes the version string internally.",
  "flows": "The version string '__version__' is read by 'parse_version_info', which then processes it into a tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears straightforward and related to version parsing. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and a function to parse it into a tuple, handling numeric parts and release candidate identifiers. The function splits the version string by '.', converts numeric parts to integers, and handles 'rc' suffixes separately. No external input, network activity, or obfuscated code present. The logic is simple and standard for version parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic version parsing utility with no signs of malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no security concerns. It appears to be a standard, benign component for version management.",
