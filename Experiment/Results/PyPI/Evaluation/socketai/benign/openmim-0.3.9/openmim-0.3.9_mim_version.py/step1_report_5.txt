  "purpose": "Parse and convert version string into a structured tuple for internal use.",
  "sources": "The version string __version__ defined within the module.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external output points.",
  "flows": "The version string is split and processed within parse_version_info, resulting in a tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs straightforward string parsing and type conversion.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and a function to parse it into a tuple. The function splits the string by '.', converts digit parts into integers, and handles 'rc' (release candidate) versions by splitting further and appending 'rc' labels. The logic is clear, standard, and contains no suspicious or malicious patterns. There are no external data inputs, network interactions, or obfuscated techniques. Overall, the code appears benign and solely serves version parsing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version parsing utility with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security concerns. It operates purely within defined, trusted input data without any external or hidden operations.",
