  "purpose": "Define a version string and parse it into a structured tuple for version comparison.",
  "sources": "Reads the hardcoded __version__ string and splits it into components.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points detected.",
  "flows": "Parsing the hardcoded version string into a tuple for further use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and static, with no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and a function to parse it into a tuple. The parsing function handles numeric parts and release candidates ('rc'), converting numeric parts to integers and appending 'rc' parts as strings. The code operates solely on a static, hardcoded string and performs no external input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears to be a standard version parsing utility, typical in software projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version parsing utility with no malicious intent or security concerns. It processes a static version string into a tuple for internal use, with no external interactions or security risks.",
