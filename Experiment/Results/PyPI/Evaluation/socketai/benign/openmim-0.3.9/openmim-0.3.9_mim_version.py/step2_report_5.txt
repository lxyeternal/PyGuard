  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:  \n   All reports correctly state that the code is a straightforward version parsing utility. The code only processes a static version string (__version__) and does not involve external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and standard. There are no logical errors or misconceptions. The descriptions are consistent and accurate regarding the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign scores as follows:  \n   - Malware: 0  \n   - Obfuscated: 0  \n   - Security Risk: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since all scores are 0, there's no need to justify higher scores. The code is clearly non-malicious, with no security risks.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The code does not perform any malicious activity—no data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports correctly interpret the code as a benign version parser. No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThe code is a simple, static version parsing utility. It performs basic string splitting and type conversion without any external dependencies, network activity, or obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scores. The code is safe and benign.",
