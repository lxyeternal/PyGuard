  ],
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up URL templates, mappings between package names and project modules, and creates a cache directory if it doesn't exist. All operations are standard, benign file system interactions and string interpolations. No untrusted input is processed beyond expanding user directories, which is safe. No network activity or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears to be configuration/setup code for dependency management without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply prepares URL templates and ensures a cache directory exists.",
