  "purpose": "Static type aliases for string literals representing AWS SDK enumerations, service identifiers, regions, and configurations to enhance type safety and autocompletion.",
  "sources": "Defined as static string literal type aliases; no external input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; purely static definitions with no data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static type alias assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "None; no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string literal type aliases for AWS SDK components, with conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no dynamic behavior, network calls, secrets, or obfuscation. The purpose is to improve static type safety and developer experience. No external data or untrusted inputs are involved. The code is straightforward and declarative, serving as a static reference for type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, well-structured set of type aliases for AWS SDK enumerations and constants. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and is safe for use in static type checking contexts.",
