{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for various string literal values used across the mediaconvert service and other AWS SDK components for type safety and clarity.",
  "sources": "Import of sys to check Python version for conditional import; declaration of string literal types for various configuration options, constants, and service/resource identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data inputs; all data are predefined string literals used for type annotations only.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely type definition.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only type alias declarations based on static string literals; no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or network calls, no obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code starts with importing sys for Python version check, then conditionally imports 'Literal' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. It proceeds to define an extensive list of string literal types as type aliases, each representing specific configurations, constants, or identifiers used in the AWS SDK (mediaconvert and others). There are no functions, no dynamic code, no external inputs, or network operations. The purpose appears to be purely for type safety and autocompletion support, with no malicious or maliciously obfuscated behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive set of type alias definitions using string literals to enforce type safety and improve developer experience. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious logic. It is a safe, static configuration and type annotation module.",
