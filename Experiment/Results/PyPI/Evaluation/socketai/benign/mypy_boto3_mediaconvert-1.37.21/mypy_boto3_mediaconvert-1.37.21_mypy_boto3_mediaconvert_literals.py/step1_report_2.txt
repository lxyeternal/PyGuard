{
  "purpose": "Defines string literal types for various AWS service configurations, codes, and settings used in boto3 stubs for type checking and validation.",
  "sources": "Imports 'sys' for Python version checking; defines type literals using 'typing.Literal' or 'typing_extensions.Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous sinks identified; the code only defines constants and types for static type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely static type definitions with no data processing or external input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; the code strictly consists of type alias definitions and conditional import for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up numerous string literal type aliases for AWS services, regions, and media formats. The conditional import of 'Literal' based on Python version is standard for compatibility. There are no functions, external calls, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The license and documentation comments are benign. Overall, this appears to be a standard type definitions file intended for static analysis and type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive collection of AWS service-related string literal types intended for static type checking. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or security issues. It solely provides type annotations for better code quality and validation.",
