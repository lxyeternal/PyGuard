  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the security implications, logical consistency, and scoring appropriateness.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines type aliases for string literals used across mediaconvert and AWS SDK components.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No external input, no dynamic code, purely static type definitions.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a comprehensive set of string literal type aliases for static type safety, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n- **Risk & Malware Score:** The report assigns a risk score of 0, malware 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Verdict:** The analysis is accurate. The code is safe, static, and intended for type annotations only.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining string literal types for AWS services, regions, and configurations, with a Python version check for importing `Literal`.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No external data or dynamic behavior.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is static, well-structured, and for type safety, with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Risk 0, malware 0. This is appropriate.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct assessment; no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Issue:** \"Empty response\" — no content to analyze.  \n- **Verdict:** No security concern here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for AWS media conversion, service identifiers, and enumerations, with a version check for import compatibility.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No external input, no dynamic code, purely static definitions.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior; purely declarative.  \n- **Scores:** Risk 0, malware 0. Correct.  \n- **Verdict:** Safe, standard type definitions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar pattern—type aliases for AWS SDK parameters, with conditional import for Python version compatibility.  \n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No dynamic behavior, no external data.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Pure static type aliasing for better code safety and clarity.  \n- **Scores:** Risk 0, malware 0. Appropriate.  \n- **Verdict:** No security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a static collection of type aliases using string literals for AWS SDK components.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** None of the reports detect any malicious or obfuscated behavior. The code does not perform any network calls, handle secrets, or execute dynamic code.  \n- **Security Risk:** Zero, as the code is purely declarative and static.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should be **0** across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be **0** as there's no obfuscation or suspicious pattern.  \n- **Risk Score:** Should be **0** because there's no security threat or vulnerability.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a well-structured, static type alias module for AWS SDK enumerations. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and is safe for use. The existing scores in the reports are consistent with this assessment.",
