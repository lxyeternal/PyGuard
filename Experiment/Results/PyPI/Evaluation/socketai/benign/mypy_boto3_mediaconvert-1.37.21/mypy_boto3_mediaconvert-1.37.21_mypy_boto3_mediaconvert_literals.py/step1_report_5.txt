  "purpose": "Define Python string literal types for various AWS SDK parameters, service identifiers, and configuration options, primarily for type safety and documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Import of sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only defines type aliases.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code consists solely of type alias definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward type alias definitions for literals.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to conditionally import Literal for type annotations, then defines numerous type aliases as Literal strings. These aliases serve to restrict values to specific strings for AWS services, regions, and configuration options, improving type safety. The structure is simple, with no dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no external data sources. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. The file is solely for static type annotations, with documentation comments included.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative, defining type aliases for AWS SDK parameter values. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leakage, and no security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured set of type definitions intended for type checking and code clarity in a larger project.",
