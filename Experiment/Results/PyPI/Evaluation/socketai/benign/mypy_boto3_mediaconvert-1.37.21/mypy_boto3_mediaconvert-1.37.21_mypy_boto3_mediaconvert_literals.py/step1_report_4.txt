  "purpose": "Define Python type literals for various AWS media conversion and service-related enumerations to enable type checking and validation in a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "Importing sys to check Python version; defining string literal types for enumerations, constants, and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "No user input, network output, or untrusted data processing observed; no data leaks or external effects detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code consists solely of static type definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; the code is purely declarative with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behavior. The version check for typing import is standard, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides extensive string literal type definitions for AWS media services and common AWS service names, regions, and other enumerations, with proper conditional import for compatibility across Python versions. There are no code injections, external network calls, or secret handling. The code is static, well-structured, and purposefully designed for type hinting. No anomalies, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type alias definitions for AWS-related enumerations, serving as a type safety aid. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is purely declarative, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
