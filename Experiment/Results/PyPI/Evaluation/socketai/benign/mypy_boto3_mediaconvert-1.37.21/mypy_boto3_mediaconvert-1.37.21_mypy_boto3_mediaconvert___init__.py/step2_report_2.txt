  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a straightforward SDK interface module for AWS MediaConvert.\n- No untrusted data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious code constructs, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The only notable anomaly is the copyright year set to 2025, which is likely a typo or placeholder.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, with very low or zero security risk scores.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1 or close to 1), indicating strong agreement on benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code does not contain any runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions that could be malicious.\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes:** The only anomaly is the future date (2025), which is probably a typo but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware scores are consistently 0; risk scores are very low, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities:** The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they only describe the code as a standard interface.\n- **Consistency:** Scores and conclusions are consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the lack of any suspicious activity, a risk score of 0 or very close to it is justified.\n- **Anomalies:** The future year (2025) in the copyright is likely a typo, not malicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a benign, boilerplate SDK interface module.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The minor anomaly (future date) does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, benign, and standard.**",
