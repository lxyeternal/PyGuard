  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a straightforward Python module that imports classes from local modules (.client and .paginator), sets up a Client alias, and defines __all__ for exports.\n- The docstring provides usage examples with boto3, which are standard for AWS SDK modules.\n- No dynamic code, external input, or network operations are present.\n- The code contains a future year (2025) in the copyright, which is unusual but not malicious.\n- All reports agree on benign intent and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Interface for MediaConvert, import/export.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Main interface module, type-safe references.\n- **Analysis:** No data flow, no anomalies, standard structure.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Interface setup, documentation.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, no secrets, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Main interface, documentation.\n- **Analysis:** The only anomaly is the future date (2025), which is likely a placeholder or typo. No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (slightly elevated), confidence=0.9.\n\n**Discussion:** The small securityRisk score (0.1) is probably due to the future date anomaly. It does not indicate malicious intent but might warrant a minor increase if considering placeholder issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Interface for AWS MediaConvert.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, no external data handling, no suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Discussion:** Similar to Report 4, the minor securityRisk is likely due to the future date anomaly. The overall assessment remains benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports and the code itself indicate no malicious behavior. **Final malware score: 0.0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. **Final obfuscated score: 0.0**\n- **Risk score:** The code is benign, with no external inputs or sensitive operations. The only minor concern is the future date (2025), which is probably a typo or placeholder, not malicious. Therefore, a low risk score of **0.1** seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0.0** | **0.0**      | **0.1** |\n\nThis reflects a benign, well-structured SDK interface module with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
