  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports describe the code as a straightforward, boilerplate SDK interface module for AWS MediaConvert.\n- They note the absence of dynamic data handling, network operations, or untrusted input processing.\n- The code only imports classes and defines exports, with embedded documentation and usage examples.\n- The only anomaly is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future and likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- Security risk scores are very low (around 0.1), mainly due to the future date anomaly, but this is not a security concern.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code is simple imports and exports, no vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the benign nature, a risk score around 0.1 is reasonable, reflecting the future date anomaly.\n- **Anomalies:** The future date is the only anomaly, but it does not impact security.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None. The code is static and standard.\n- **Consistency:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minor anomaly, not security-related)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a benign, standard SDK interface module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a typo or placeholder.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Metric            | Score |\n|-------------------|---------|\n| Malware           | 0       |\n| Obfuscated        | 0       |\n| Security Risk     | 0.1     |\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent, and the code appears entirely safe.",
