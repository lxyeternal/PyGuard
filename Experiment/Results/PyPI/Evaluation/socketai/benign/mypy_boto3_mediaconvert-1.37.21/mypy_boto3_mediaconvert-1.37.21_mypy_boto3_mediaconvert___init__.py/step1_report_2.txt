  "purpose": "Main interface module for the mediaconvert service, providing type-safe client and paginator references.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator), and static strings for __all__.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Import statements initialize objects; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, type annotations, and an explicit list of exported names. It includes a documentation comment and a copyright notice. The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or security-sensitive operations. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The structure is straightforward and consistent with standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign interface module with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely sets up references for the mediaconvert service client and related paginators, with no data manipulation or external interactions that could be malicious.",
