  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the details with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, primarily importing and exporting classes for the AWS MediaConvert SDK interface.\n- No dynamic data handling, network operations, or input processing is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- The documentation contains a future year (2025), which is unusual but not malicious—likely a typo or placeholder.\n- The code structure is standard, with no suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Benign SDK interface.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Fully aligned with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Main interface module for MediaConvert.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Interface setup with documentation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Main interface, with documentation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (due to future date in copyright)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Analysis:** The slight security risk score (0.1) seems to be based solely on the future date, which is not a security concern. The rest of the analysis aligns well.\n\n**Recommendation:** The security risk score could be adjusted to 0, as the future date is not indicative of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Interface for AWS MediaConvert.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (again, due to future date)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Analysis:** Same reasoning as Report 4; the future date is not a security issue.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent and appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, matching the code's straightforward nature.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in two reports due to the future year; this is unjustified from a security perspective.\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n- The **risk scores** should be **0** across all reports, as there's no actual security concern.\n- The **malware** and **obfuscated** scores are correctly assigned as 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Final estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risk present)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. The only minor point is the future year in the copyright, which does not impact security.\n\n**No further action needed.**",
