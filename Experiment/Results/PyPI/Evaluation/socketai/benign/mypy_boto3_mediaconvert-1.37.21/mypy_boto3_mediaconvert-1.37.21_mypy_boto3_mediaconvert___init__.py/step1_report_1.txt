{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for the MediaConvert service, importing necessary classes and defining exports for a Python SDK module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.client and .paginator). The docstring containing usage examples and documentation links.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no input handling or data processing present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this code primarily imports and exports classes, with no runtime data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs observed. The documentation contains a future year (2025) which is unconventional but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module defining imports and exports for the MediaConvert SDK interface. The docstring includes usage examples and a URL, both of which are benign. No dynamic execution, external input, or suspicious behavior is present. No indications of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic. The module appears to be standard boilerplate code for a client SDK interface.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign SDK interface module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports and re-exports classes for easier SDK use. No malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security issues detected.",
