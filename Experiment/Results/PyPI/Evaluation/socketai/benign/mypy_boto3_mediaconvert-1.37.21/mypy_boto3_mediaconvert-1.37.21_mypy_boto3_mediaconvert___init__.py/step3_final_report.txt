{
  "purpose": "Provides a Python module that sets up the AWS MediaConvert SDK interface with import/export definitions and usage documentation.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules (.client and .paginator), documentation string, and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no runtime data handling or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and class definitions without dynamic data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year is set to 2025, which is in the future and likely a typo or placeholder; no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK interface setup with no dynamic code, input handling, or network operations. The only anomaly is the future year, which does not pose a security risk. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the risk score is very low (0.1) due to the date anomaly. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, boilerplate SDK interface module with no malicious behavior or security risks. The minor anomaly (future date) does not impact security. The scores are consistent with the benign assessment.",
