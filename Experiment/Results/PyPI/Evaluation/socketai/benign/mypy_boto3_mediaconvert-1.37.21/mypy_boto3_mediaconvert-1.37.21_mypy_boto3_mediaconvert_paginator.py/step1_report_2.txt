{
  "purpose": "Provide type annotations and paginators for the mediaconvert service client in boto3, facilitating type-safe iteration over paginated responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads from import statements, class method parameters, and type definitions. No untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send data over the network, write to files, or execute system commands. No sinks for untrusted data leading to security effects are detected.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input or malicious data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward and primarily involves type annotations and class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code defines paginator classes for the mediaconvert service, with conditional imports based on Python version, and type annotations for method parameters and return types. The classes inherit from a base Paginator class, and the paginate methods accept kwargs with type definitions for paginated requests. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or network activity is present. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard type annotation stub implementation for boto3 paginators.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, type-annotated paginator module for boto3 mediaconvert, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is intended for type safety and does not perform any harmful actions.",
