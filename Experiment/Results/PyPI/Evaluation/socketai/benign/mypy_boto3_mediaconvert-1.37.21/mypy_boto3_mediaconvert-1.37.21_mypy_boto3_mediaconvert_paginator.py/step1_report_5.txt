{
  "purpose": "The code provides type annotations and paginator class definitions for the mediaconvert service client in boto3, facilitating paginated API calls with type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; type annotations used in class methods and type guards.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "The code defines class hierarchies and method signatures that enable safe pagination, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard stub and wrapper code with explicit type annotations. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is purely for defining paginator classes with type annotations and documentation links. It leverages standard Python typing and boto3 structures, with conditional imports for compatibility. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or data leaks are observed. The structure follows common patterns for SDK stubs, and no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of paginator class definitions for boto3 mediaconvert client with type annotations. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
