{
  "purpose": "Define type-safe paginator classes for the mediaconvert AWS service client using boto3 stubs, enabling IDE support and static type checking.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs; class method parameters via **kwargs with type unpacking; conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "The code mainly involves class definitions and method signatures; no direct sinks like network calls, file writes, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Class methods `paginate` accept untrusted keyword arguments (**kwargs) with specified types, but do not process or execute untrusted data directly; no data flows to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward, with standard type annotations and class structures. Use of conditional import for `Unpack` based on Python version is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The script provides type annotations for AWS mediaconvert paginator classes, defining `paginate` methods with type safety via Unpack and specific request/response types. It conditionally imports `Unpack` for Python 3.12+. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated logic is present. The code is purely structural, focusing on static type support. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, structured set of paginator class definitions for boto3 mediaconvert client, aimed at enhancing static type checking and IDE support. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. No security risks identified.",
