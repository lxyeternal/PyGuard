  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator class definitions for boto3 mediaconvert client, serving as static type support and IDE assistance.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, method signatures accepting **kwargs, type annotation imports, conditional imports for Python version compatibility.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, external communication, or untrusted data handling; pass-through of kwargs to boto3's pagination functions.",
  "flows": "paginate methods receive kwargs, which are forwarded to boto3's pagination logic without modification.",
  "anomalies": "Use of **kwargs is standard; no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns detected. Conditional import for Unpack is normal for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, structural module providing type annotations for boto3 mediaconvert paginators. It contains class definitions with paginate methods that accept kwargs for flexibility. No runtime logic, data processing, or network activity is present. The use of kwargs is typical for SDK interfaces and does not indicate malicious intent. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code are observed. The code's purpose is solely to enhance type safety and IDE support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and intended for static type checking. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The slight potential for misuse via kwargs is inherent to SDK design and does not constitute malicious activity.",
