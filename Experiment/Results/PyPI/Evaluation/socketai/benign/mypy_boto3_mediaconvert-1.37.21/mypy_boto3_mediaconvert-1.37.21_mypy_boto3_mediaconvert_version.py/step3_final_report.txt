  "purpose": "Define the version string for the package, serving as metadata.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the string '__version__' with no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the version string is assigned statically without input or output pathways.",
  "anomalies": "The only anomaly is the future year '2025' in the copyright comment, which appears to be a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment of a version string with a comment and copyright notice. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data sources, or suspicious patterns. The only minor anomaly is the future year, which does not pose any security risk. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with appropriate scores of zero for malware and obfuscation. The slight risk score of 0.1 in one report is due to the future year, which is not a security concern but could be a metadata inconsistency. Overall, the code is safe, and the assessments are accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The only minor issue is the future year, which does not impact security. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, and their scoring is appropriate. The security risk score should be 0, not 0.1, for accuracy.",
