  "flows": "The version string is assigned to the __version__ variable; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a copyright statement with a future year (2025), which is unusual and potentially suspicious or placeholder-like.",
  "analysis": "The code simply sets a version string for the module/package and includes a copyright statement. No external data inputs, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious logic are present. The future copyright year could indicate placeholder or inconsistent metadata but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as metadata for versioning. No malicious behavior detected. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which might warrant further review for correctness but does not pose a security risk.",
