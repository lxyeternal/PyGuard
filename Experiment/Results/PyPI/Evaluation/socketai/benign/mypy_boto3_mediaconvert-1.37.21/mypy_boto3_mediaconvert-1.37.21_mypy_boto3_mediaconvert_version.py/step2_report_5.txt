  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n- There are no external data flows, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution.\n- The comments are benign, mainly copyright notices.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future year (2025) in the copyright comment, which is unlikely to be malicious but could be a placeholder or typo.\n\n---\n\n### Issue-by-issue review:\n\n**Reports 1-4:**\n- All conclude that the code is benign, with a confidence of 1.\n- The reasoning is sound: simple static assignment, no suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate.\n- No changes needed here.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Notes the future year (2025) as an anomaly, which is true.\n- The confidence is slightly lower at 0.9, and securityRisk is 0.1, which seems reasonable.\n- The report correctly states that this is likely a benign placeholder or typo, not malicious.\n- The malware score remains 0, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores consistent?**  \n  Yes. All reports agree on no malicious activity, and the scores reflect that.\n\n- **Are any claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with the only minor anomaly being the future year.\n\n- **Is the malware score justified?**  \n  Absolutely. The code does not perform any malicious actions, and the malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Is the obfuscated score justified?**  \n  Yes. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n- **Should the security risk be higher?**  \n  No. There are no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\nThe only notable point is the future year in the copyright statement, which is not a security issue but could be flagged as a metadata inconsistency.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a simple, benign version declaration with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- Note the future year as a minor metadata inconsistency but not a security concern.\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, and the assessments are justified.**",
