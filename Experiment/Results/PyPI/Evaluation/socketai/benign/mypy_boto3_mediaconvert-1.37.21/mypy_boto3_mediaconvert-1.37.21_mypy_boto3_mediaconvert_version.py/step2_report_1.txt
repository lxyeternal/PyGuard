  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings to the actual code.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\nThe code snippet is:\n\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.21\"\n```\n\nIt consists solely of a comment, a copyright statement, and a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues and code behavior:\n\n- **Presence of malicious activity?** No. The code is static, simple, and does not perform any external operations, data flows, or dynamic execution.\n- **Obfuscation?** No. The code is transparent.\n- **Malware?** No evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Security risk?** Essentially zero; the code only defines a version string.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Summary:** No anomalies, benign, straightforward.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Summary:** Same as above, benign, metadata only.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Summary:** Same as above, straightforward.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Summary:** Same, straightforward version assignment.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Summary:** Similar, but notes the future year (2025) in the copyright.\n- **Assessment:** The future year is unusual, possibly a placeholder or typo, but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — perhaps slightly overestimating risk due to the future date.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign zero, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** Zero across all, correct.\n- **Security risk:** All are zero or near-zero. The only point of contention is Report 5, which assigns a 0.1 risk due to the future year.\n\n**Is the 0.1 security risk justified?**  \nNot really. The future year is suspicious but not malicious or risky from a security standpoint. It might be a typo or placeholder, but it doesn't introduce any security vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: **0** — accurate.  \n  - Obfuscated: **0** — accurate.  \n  - Security risk: **0** — more appropriate than 0.1, unless there's a specific reason to consider the future date as a risk.\n\n- **Justification for higher scores:**  \n  No evidence of malware or obfuscation. The only concern is the future date, which is not a security risk but might warrant correction for correctness.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**My estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a simple, static version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The only anomaly is the future year, which is not a security concern but might be a typo or placeholder. Therefore, all reports are accurate in their benign assessment, but the security risk score should be zero, not 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent with the code. I recommend adjusting the security risk score in Report 5 to 0 for accuracy.",
