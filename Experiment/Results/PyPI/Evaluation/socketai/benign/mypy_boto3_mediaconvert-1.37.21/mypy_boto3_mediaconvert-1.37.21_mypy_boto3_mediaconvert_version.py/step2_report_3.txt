  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a simple string assignment to `__version__` with a comment and copyright statement.\n- No external data, input/output, dynamic code, or obfuscation.\n- No signs of malicious activity, malware, or suspicious behavior.\n- The only noted anomaly is the future year \"2025\" in the copyright statement, which could be a placeholder or typo, but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code itself does not contain any malicious logic or suspicious patterns.\n- The version string assignment is straightforward.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malware.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The only point of contention is the \"future year\" (2025) noted as an anomaly, which is a minor metadata inconsistency, not a security concern.\n- No report claims or implies any malicious intent or activity; they all agree on benignity.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is appropriate.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are very low (mostly 0, with one at 0.1), which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n- The `obfuscated` scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- The confidence scores are high (1 or 0.9), appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n- No evidence supports raising the risk or malware scores.\n- The only anomaly is the future year, which does not impact security but might warrant a note for correctness.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 or very close to 0 (e.g., 0.1 at most for the future year anomaly)\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or at most 0.1 for the future year anomaly, but not a security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports are accurate in their benign assessment. The only minor note is the future year in the copyright, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the scores as they are, with perhaps a note that the future year is a metadata inconsistency but not a security concern.",
