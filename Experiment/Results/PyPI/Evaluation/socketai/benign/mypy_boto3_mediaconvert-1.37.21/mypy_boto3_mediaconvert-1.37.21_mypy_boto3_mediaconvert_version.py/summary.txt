  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The only minor issue is the future year, which does not impact security. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, and their scoring is appropriate. The security risk score should be 0, not 0.1, for accuracy."
