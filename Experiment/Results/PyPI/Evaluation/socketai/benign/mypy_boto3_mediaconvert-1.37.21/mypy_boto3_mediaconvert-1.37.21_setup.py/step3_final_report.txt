  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging the mypy-boto3-mediaconvert Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static data used throughout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard setup script with no suspicious or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup.py script, importing Path and setuptools.setup, reading a local README.md for description, and defining package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. It does not perform dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted input. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. All signals indicate benign intent. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code content. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present, and the code aligns with best practices for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup file with no malicious or suspicious elements. The security and malware scores are correctly assigned as zero, and the overall risk is negligible. The reports are accurate and consistent, requiring no modifications.",
