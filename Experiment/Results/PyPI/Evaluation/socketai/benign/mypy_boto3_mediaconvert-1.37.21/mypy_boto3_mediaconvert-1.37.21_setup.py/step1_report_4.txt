{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up and distributing the mypy-boto3-mediaconvert Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; imports 'setup' from setuptools; reads environment variables indirectly via package requirements if any; reads package metadata directly from code.",
  "sinks": "None identified—no code writes data to external systems, executes untrusted input, or handles sensitive data insecurely.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flow; setup process is static and primarily involves package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; all code appears standard for a Python setup script. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The license and author information are consistent with open-source practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging. It reads the long description from a markdown file and supplies metadata for package distribution. It uses only benign modules and functions, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of sensitive data. The license, author, and URL fields point to legitimate sources. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration file for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
