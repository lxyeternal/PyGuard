  "purpose": "This setup script is used to package and distribute the mypy-boto3-mediaconvert library, providing metadata, dependencies, and package data information.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing setup from setuptools; static string definitions for package metadata",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains direct sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or system modification operations are present",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the script solely defines package metadata and configuration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected; the code is standard setup.py structure",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads static documentation, and calls setup() with well-defined parameters for packaging. No dynamic code execution, no environment variable use, and no user input handling are present. All data used is static or file-based, with no indication of malicious intent or anomalous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a library. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate and safe packaging script.",
