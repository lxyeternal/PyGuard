  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging a Python project named 'mypy-boto3-mediaconvert'.",
  "sources": "Reads its own file path for README.md content; imports setup from setuptools; defines static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reads static data from the filesystem to generate long description; passes static parameters to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; all code appears standard for a setup script; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious imports or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup configuration with static values for package metadata. It reads a README file for long description. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data are used. No malicious functions, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The imports and data handling are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for packaging a Python module. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It is a straightforward configuration script.",
