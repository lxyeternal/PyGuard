  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output display.",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output, potential reliance on command-line arguments.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv --> conditional check --> output via sys.stdout.write.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. No network activity or external data access present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs package info or version based on user input. It imports sys and uses sys.stdout.write for printing information. There are no inputs from untrusted sources besides command-line arguments, which are checked simply for '--version'. No data is sent over the network, written to files, or executed dynamically. The code does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior, no hidden backdoors, and no obfuscation detected. It appears to be a benign utility script designed solely for informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign CLI tool with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs basic output operations based on command-line input, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors.",
