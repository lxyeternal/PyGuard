  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version number based on a command-line argument.\n   - It imports only `sys` for argument parsing and output.\n   - The functions `print_info()` and `print_version()` output hardcoded, static strings.\n   - The main function checks for `\"--version\"` in `sys.argv` and calls the appropriate function.\n   - No user input is processed beyond argument checking.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, dynamic code execution, or environment variable use.\n   - No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Flaws:**\n   - The logic is straightforward and correct for its purpose.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or data leaks.\n   - No external dependencies or dynamic behavior that could be exploited.\n   - The code is benign and safe for distribution.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification:**\n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is justified; there's no malicious activity.\n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code does not pose security risks.\n   - **Confidence:** All reports have high confidence (1), justified by the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No issues found that would warrant raising the malware or risk scores.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility for informational purposes.\n   - No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior detected.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n6. **My Final Estimation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, readable code)\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a simple, safe CLI script that outputs static package info or version details. The reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
