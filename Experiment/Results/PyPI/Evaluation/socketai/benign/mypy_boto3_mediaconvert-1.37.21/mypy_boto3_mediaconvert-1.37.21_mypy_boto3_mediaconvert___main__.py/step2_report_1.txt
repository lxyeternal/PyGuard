  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility.\n- It imports only `sys`.\n- When run, it checks if `--version` is in `sys.argv`.\n  - If yes, it outputs the version number (`1.37.21`).\n  - Otherwise, it outputs static package info (name, version, docs, changelog, etc.).\n- No external data, network calls, dynamic code execution, or sensitive data handling.\n- No obfuscation, no malicious code, no backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code functions as intended: providing static package info or version info based on command-line argument.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None detected.\n\n### Review of reports:\n- All five reports uniformly describe the script as a benign, straightforward CLI utility.\n- They emphasize the lack of suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- They correctly identify the script's purpose: informational output based on command-line arguments.\n- Confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign description.\n\n### Potential issues in reasoning or scoring:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no anomalies or suspicious behavior are claimed.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which is justified.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, matching the code's clarity.\n- The malware scores are 0, which is correct given the static, informational nature of the script.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent with the code.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The script performs a benign, static informational task with no suspicious or malicious features. All evidence supports a low or zero risk assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code and reports are aligned; the script is a safe, straightforward CLI utility. No changes needed in scoring or conclusions.",
