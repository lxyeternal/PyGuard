  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides informational output about boto3 MediaConvert stub library.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, sys.stdout for output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write for output, no other sinks are present",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' triggers print_version, which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info is called to output package info",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; straightforward functionality, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling besides standard inputs",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple CLI utility that prints package information or version number based on command-line input. It imports sys for output and argument handling. No user input is processed beyond checking '--version' in sys.argv. The functions print_info and print_version only output static strings. No external data sources, no environment variable use, no network calls, and no dynamic code evaluation are present. The code structure is clear, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code strictly performs informational display tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply outputs static package information and version details without handling sensitive data or performing any harmful actions.",
