  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The script is a simple CLI utility.\n- It imports `sys` to handle command-line arguments and output.\n- When run, if `--version` is present in `sys.argv`, it outputs the version number.\n- Otherwise, it outputs static package info.\n- All outputs are static strings; no dynamic data, external data sources, or sensitive data handling.\n- No network activity, obfuscation, or code execution beyond printing static info.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** None. The code performs straightforward output based on command-line arguments.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n- **Security risks:** None. No handling of sensitive data, no external calls, no dynamic code.\n\n### Report Analysis:\n- All five reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- They correctly identify that the script only outputs static information and responds to a specific command-line argument.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected.\n- The confidence levels are all 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- Since the code is purely informational with no external or dynamic behavior, all scores should remain at 0.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is safe, benign, and performs a simple informational task.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version.\n- No issues, no vulnerabilities, no malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at 0.\n\n**No changes needed.**",
