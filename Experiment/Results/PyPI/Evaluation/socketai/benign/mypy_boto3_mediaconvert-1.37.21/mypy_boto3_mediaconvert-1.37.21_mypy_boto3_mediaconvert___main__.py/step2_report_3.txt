  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Behavior:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information or version number.\n   - It responds to the `--version` argument; otherwise, it prints package info.\n   - It uses only standard libraries (`sys`) and static strings.\n   - No user input processing beyond argument check.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, dynamic code execution, or environment variable usage.\n   - No obfuscation, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious code.\n   - No external data access or dynamic code evaluation.\n   - The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the script.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code is straightforward and correct for its purpose.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are apparent.\n   - The only potential critique is that it could be expanded for more functionality, but that does not imply a security risk.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Confidence:** All reports show full confidence (1), which is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores:**\n   - No discrepancies are evident; all scores align with the code's behavior.\n   - The assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment & My Final Scores:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear code)\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a simple, safe CLI utility that only outputs static information. All reports correctly identify this. No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's behavior.",
