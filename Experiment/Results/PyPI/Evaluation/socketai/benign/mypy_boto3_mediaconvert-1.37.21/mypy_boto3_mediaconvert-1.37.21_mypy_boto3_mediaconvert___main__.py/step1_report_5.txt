  "purpose": "Main CLI entrypoint for a package that provides information about boto3 MediaConvert stub version and documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Writes package info and version details to stdout.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument in sys.argv, then calls print_version() or print_info() accordingly, both of which write to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code solely outputs static package information and responds to a command-line flag.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs package metadata and version info. It reads command-line arguments to determine which information to display. There are no external data inputs beyond sys.argv, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code's structure is simple and standard for CLI entry points, with no obfuscation or complex logic. All output is static and informational.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility designed to display package information and version details. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation present. It functions solely as an informational script.",
