  "purpose": "CLI utility for displaying package information and version details about boto3 MediaConvert stubs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv, reads from sys.stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to sys.stdout, potentially based on command-line input.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' argument in sys.argv; if present, calls print_version(), else calls print_info().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no external network connections, no suspicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI script that provides package info and version. It checks for a specific argument '--version' and outputs static strings accordingly. The output strings are static and contain no user input or dynamic data. The script does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or other actions that could pose security risks. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign CLI utility with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be intended for informational purposes only.",
