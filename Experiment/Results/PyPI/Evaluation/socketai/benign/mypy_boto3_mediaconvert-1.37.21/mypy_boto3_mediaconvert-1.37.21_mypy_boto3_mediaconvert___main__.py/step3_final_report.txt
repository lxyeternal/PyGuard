  "purpose": "Provides static package information and version details for a CLI utility.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (`sys.argv`), static strings in functions.",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout via `sys.stdout.write()`.",
  "flows": "Argument check (`'--version' in sys.argv`) leading to either `print_version()` or `print_info()` output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and lacks suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI script that outputs static package info or version based on a command-line argument. It imports only `sys`, performs a direct argument check, and prints predefined strings. No external data, network calls, dynamic code execution, or sensitive data handling are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious elements. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward CLI utility that outputs static information. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior is detected. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No improvements or changes are necessary.",
