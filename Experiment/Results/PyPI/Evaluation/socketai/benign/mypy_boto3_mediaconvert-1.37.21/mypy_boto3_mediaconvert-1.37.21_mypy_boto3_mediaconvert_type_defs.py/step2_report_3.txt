  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Overall Content & Purpose**:\n   - All reports describe the code as a comprehensive set of type annotations and data structure definitions for the mediaconvert SDK.\n   - No executable code, network calls, or runtime logic are present.\n   - The code appears to be purely for type safety, documentation, and SDK schema purposes.\n\n2. **Potential Data Leaks or Malicious Behavior**:\n   - No hardcoded credentials, URLs, or backdoors are detected.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or hidden system calls.\n   - The imports are standard, with version-conditional imports for compatibility, which is common in SDK type definition files.\n\n3. **Data Flow & Security Risks**:\n   - Data flows are limited to data structure definitions; no untrusted data is processed at runtime.\n   - No functions or code execution paths that could be exploited.\n   - Fields are data descriptors only, with no dynamic or executable logic.\n\n4. **Anomalies & Red Flags**:\n   - No anomalies such as suspicious code, obfuscated constructs, or misleading variable names.\n   - The presence of extensive type annotations and documentation links suggests a well-structured SDK module.\n\n5. **Analysis & Conclusion**:\n   - The entire codebase is static type annotations, primarily using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports.\n   - No executable code, network operations, or runtime logic that could be exploited.\n   - The code is consistent with SDK schema definitions meant for static type checking, not for execution.\n\n6. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious activity or payloads detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — No obfuscation; code is straightforward and clear.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — No security risk or attack surface present in static type definitions.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural and safe.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The data flows are static and intended for type checking, not runtime execution.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is benign, well-structured type annotations for SDK use.\n- No modifications needed; scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the nature of the code.",
