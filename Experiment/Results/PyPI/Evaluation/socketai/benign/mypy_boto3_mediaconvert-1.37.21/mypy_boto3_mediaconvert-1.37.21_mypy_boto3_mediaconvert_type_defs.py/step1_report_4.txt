  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for mediaconvert service API interactions.",
  "sources": "Constant imported type definitions, __future__ imports, sys.version_info checks, all class and variable definitions, import statements, and type alias declarations.",
  "sinks": "None detected; code mainly defines types and data structures without executing untrusted data processing or system calls.",
  "flows": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code is solely for type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or logic; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behavior present. The code contains extensive type definitions, which are typical for SDKs or API schemas.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly consists of import statements, conditional imports based on Python version, and numerous TypedDict and type alias definitions for API request/response modeling. It does not execute any runtime code or perform operations that could be malicious. The presence of copyright info and documentation links suggests a standard SDK module. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payload, or system interference. The code’s structure is consistent with type annotation files, and no dynamic code execution, network operations, or file system modifications are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for a media conversion SDK, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks present. It solely provides data schemas for API interactions. It appears benign and purely structural.",
