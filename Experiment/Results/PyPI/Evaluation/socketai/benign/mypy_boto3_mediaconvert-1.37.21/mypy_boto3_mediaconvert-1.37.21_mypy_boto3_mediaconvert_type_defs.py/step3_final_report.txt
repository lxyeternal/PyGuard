{
  "purpose": "The code provides extensive static type annotations and data structure definitions for the mediaconvert SDK, serving as schemas for API interactions and ensuring type safety.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data only through type annotations and data definitions; no runtime data sources or external inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no runtime sinks; the code does not process or execute data, only defines data schemas.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to static type definitions; no dynamic or executable data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected; the code is well-structured and adheres to standard SDK schema practices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of TypedDicts, type aliases, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility. It contains no executable functions, network calls, or dynamic logic. The extensive documentation and licensing comments further suggest a legitimate SDK schema module. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The static nature of the code and absence of runtime logic confirm its benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This is a static, purely structural set of type annotations for the mediaconvert SDK, with no executable code, network activity, or malicious payloads. It is safe and poses no security risk.",
