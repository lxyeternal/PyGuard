  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for mediaconvert service API interactions.",
  "sources": "All class and type definitions, including imports and type annotations, especially where data is read into TypedDicts or variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through response or input fields, or misuse of fields that could facilitate malicious behavior. No explicit code execution or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Data flows primarily through type definitions, where untrusted data could be mapped to internal data structures, but no execution flow or network requests are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL or network calls, or backdoors. The code strictly consists of type definitions, with no executable or dynamic code. No obfuscated constructs or misleading variables observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations for the mediaconvert SDK, using TypedDict and Union to define data structures for request and response objects. It imports standard libraries and typing modules securely, with conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. The structure includes no runtime logic, no code injection points, and no network operations. All fields are data descriptors, and there are no apparent triggers or functions executing code. The presence of verbose type definitions indicates this is purely for type safety and documentation, not execution or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of type annotations and data structure definitions with no executable code or network operations. It is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It solely serves to enhance type safety and developer tooling for the mediaconvert SDK.",
