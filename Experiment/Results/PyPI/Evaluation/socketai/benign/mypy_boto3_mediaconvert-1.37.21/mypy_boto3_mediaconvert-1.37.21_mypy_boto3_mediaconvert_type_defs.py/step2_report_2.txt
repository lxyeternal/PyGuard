  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Overall Purpose & Content**:\n   - All reports describe a large set of type annotations and data structure definitions for the mediaconvert SDK, primarily using TypedDict, Union, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n   - No executable code, network calls, or dynamic logic is present.\n   - The code is purely for type safety, documentation, and SDK schema purposes.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns**:\n   - The reports explicitly state that there are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, URLs, or network operations are detected.\n   - The code is static and only defines data schemas for API interactions.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Data Flows & Sinks**:\n   - Data flows are limited to type annotations, with no runtime logic or data processing.\n   - No untrusted data is being executed or used in a way that could lead to code injection or remote code execution.\n   - The data structures could, in theory, be populated with malicious data, but the code itself does not process or execute this data.\n\n4. **Errors & Anomalies**:\n   - Reports mention \"Empty response\" for some reports, indicating no further details or potential issues were provided.\n   - No anomalies such as obfuscation, suspicious imports, or code injection points are present.\n\n5. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0.0 — No executable code, network activity, or malicious payloads detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0 — The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or misleading constructs.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0.0 — Given the nature of the code, there is no security risk or attack vector.\n\n6. **Critical Evaluation**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that this is purely a type annotation module, with no runtime or executable elements.\n   - The detailed type definitions do not introduce any security vulnerabilities inherently.\n   - The use of conditional imports for Python version compatibility is standard practice and not suspicious.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n\n| Metric             | Estimated Score | Justification                                                                                     |\n|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0.0               | No malicious code, no network calls, no code execution points.                                |\n| Obfuscated         | 0.0               | Clear, explicit type definitions; no obfuscation or misleading constructs.                  |\n| Risk               | 0.0               | Purely structural; no attack surface or security implications.                              |\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nThe entire codebase is a static, type annotation schema for an SDK. It poses no security risk, malware, or obfuscation concerns. The reports are accurate in their assessment, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary**:  \n- The code is safe, transparent, and solely for type safety and documentation purposes.  \n- No further action needed from a security standpoint.",
