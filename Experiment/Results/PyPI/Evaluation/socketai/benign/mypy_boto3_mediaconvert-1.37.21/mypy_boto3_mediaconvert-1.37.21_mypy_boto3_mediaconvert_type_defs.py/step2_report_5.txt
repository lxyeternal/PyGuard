  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Purpose & Content**: It states that the code consists solely of type annotations and data structure definitions for the mediaconvert SDK, with no executable code, network calls, or malicious payloads.\n   - **Analysis & Confidence**: The review confirms that the code is purely for type safety, documentation, and SDK schema purposes. The confidence is high (1), and the malware score is 0.\n   - **Assessment**: The report's conclusion is consistent with the code content. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.\n\n2. **Reports 2, 3, 5**:\n   - **Errors**: All report \"Empty response\" or similar, indicating no additional analysis or findings.\n   - **Assessment**: No new information or concerns.\n\n3. **Report 4**:\n   - **Purpose & Content**: Similar to Report 1, it describes the code as purely type definitions, with no execution logic or network operations.\n   - **Analysis & Confidence**: The review confirms the code is safe, purely structural, with no signs of malicious intent. The confidence is 1.0, malware score is 0.\n   - **Assessment**: The conclusion aligns with the code, which is a set of extensive type annotations and data schemas.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code Content**: Entirely composed of type annotations, TypedDicts, type aliases, and import statements for compatibility.\n- **Flow & Behavior**: No runtime logic, no dynamic code, no network calls, no payloads, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware & Security Risks**: None detected. The code is purely structural for type safety.\n- **Potential Attack Surface**: None. No executable code or data processing.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a comprehensive, static type annotation module for the mediaconvert SDK.\n- It does not contain any executable logic, network operations, or data leaks.\n- The extensive use of TypedDicts and type aliases is standard for SDK schema definitions.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware**: **0** (safe, purely structural)\n- **Obfuscated**: **0** (not obfuscated; straightforward type definitions)\n- **Risk**: **0** (no security risk or attack vector)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**:\nThis code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations and data schemas for the mediaconvert SDK. It poses no security or malware threat.\n\n**Final estimated scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis or clarification is needed.",
