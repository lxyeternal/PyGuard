  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Overall Content and Purpose**:\n   - The code is a comprehensive set of type annotations and data structure definitions for the mediaconvert SDK.\n   - It includes numerous TypedDicts, type aliases, conditional imports for compatibility, and documentation comments.\n   - There are no executable functions, network calls, or dynamic code.\n\n2. **Potential Data Leaks or Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The code only defines data schemas; no runtime logic, code execution, or network operations are present.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, URLs, or backdoors are observed.\n   - The imports are standard, with version-based conditional imports for typing modules, which is common practice.\n\n3. **Data Flow and Data Integrity**:\n   - Data flows are limited to type definitions, which are static.\n   - The only possible concern could be if untrusted data is mapped into these structures, but that is outside the scope of static type definitions.\n   - No dynamic or executable code is present that could be exploited.\n\n4. **Anomalies and Signs of Obfuscation or Sabotage**:\n   - No obfuscated constructs, misleading variable names, or hidden code.\n   - The code appears clean, well-structured, and adheres to standard SDK type annotation practices.\n   - The presence of detailed documentation and licensing info suggests a legitimate SDK module.\n\n5. **Scores and Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — no executable code, network calls, or malicious payloads detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — no obfuscation, only clear type annotations.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — purely static data definitions, no attack surface.\n\n6. **Errors and Logical Flaws**:\n   - The reports mention \"Empty response\" for reports 2, 3, and 5, indicating no issues or data to analyze there.\n   - The first report is thorough and concludes that the code is safe, with high confidence.\n\n7. **Potential for Exploitation**:\n   - Since this is only type annotation code, the main concern would be if these types are misused elsewhere, but within this static context, there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a set of static type definitions for an SDK, with no executable or network code.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The detailed analysis confirms that this is a benign, structural codebase intended for type safety and documentation.\n\n**Recommended Scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThis supply chain component appears entirely safe. It serves as a schema for SDK data structures, with no malicious payloads or obfuscation. The reports' assessments align with this conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Final verdict**:  \n**Malware score: 0**  \n**Obfuscated score: 0**  \n**Risk score: 0**",
