{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS MediaConvert SDK, providing method signatures for API calls with type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, botocore, and local modules; method parameters unpacked from predefined request types.",
  "sinks": "Methods invoke AWS API endpoints; no data is sent to untrusted external sinks or malicious destinations.",
  "flows": "Method parameters unpacked via kwargs flow into API calls; no external data processing or malicious data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; the copyright year 2025 is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured SDK wrapper with type annotations, method overloads, and no runtime logic or data manipulation. It employs standard patterns for SDK interfaces, with dynamic kwargs used for flexibility but not indicating malicious intent. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe SDK interface for AWS MediaConvert with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements detected. The low scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; minor risk scores due to dynamic argument unpacking are justified but do not indicate actual vulnerabilities.",
