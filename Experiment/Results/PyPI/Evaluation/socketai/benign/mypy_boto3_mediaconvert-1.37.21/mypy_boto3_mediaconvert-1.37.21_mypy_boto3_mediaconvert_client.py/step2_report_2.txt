  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clarifies that this is a type annotation and client interface for AWS MediaConvert, with imports from standard libraries, botocore, and local modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of data being sent to untrusted sinks or malicious flows; method signatures are for API calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. The unusual copyright year (2025) is noted but not suspicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward, well-structured SDK wrapper with type annotations. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. Confidence: 1.0\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that this is a type-annotated interface for AWS MediaConvert, with no suspicious logic or data handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. Confidence: 1.0\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on the purpose of providing type safety and API method signatures.\n- No runtime logic, data manipulation, or external system interactions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard SDK stub, with no malicious behaviors.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. Confidence: 1.0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Describes the class extending BaseClient, with method signatures for API calls.\n- No dynamic code execution, data processing, or untrusted data handling.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK interface, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. Confidence: 1.0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Notes the use of type annotations, method signatures, and overloads.\n- Mentions that parameters are unpacked from kwargs; no malicious behavior.\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) due to the dynamic nature of kwargs, but still negligible.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent; primarily a type-safe SDK wrapper.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (due to dynamic kwargs, but very low risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0; no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate no obfuscation; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code—an SDK interface with no runtime logic, external commands, or data leaks—the overall security risk remains negligible, close to 0.1 at most, due to the use of dynamic kwargs which could, in theory, be misused, but in this context, it’s standard practice.\n\n### **Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, well-structured, and standard.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, theoretical risk due to dynamic kwargs, but practically negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured, type-annotated SDK wrapper for AWS MediaConvert. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present. The minor risk score accounts for the dynamic parameter unpacking but is not indicative of actual security issues.\n\n**Recommendation:** No further action needed; the code is safe.",
