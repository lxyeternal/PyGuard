{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface definitions for the AWS MediaConvert service SDK, facilitating type-safe API interactions.",
  "sources": "Module imports, sys.version_info checks, and class/method definitions that define the client interface and its operations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks involving untrusted data handling, system commands, network connections, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "Method definitions act as interfaces to AWS API calls, with no internal data processing logic or untrusted data flows evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code is mainly type annotations, class definitions, and method signatures for an SDK client.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class MediaConvertClient extending BaseClient with various methods representing API operations. It imports necessary types, uses type annotations, and includes overloads for paginator methods. No dynamic code execution, data processing, or untrusted data handling is present. The code appears to be a structured, well-documented SDK interface with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK client interface for AWS MediaConvert, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is purely for type annotations and method signatures. The overall security risk is negligible.",
