  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a type-annotated AWS MediaConvert client; sources are standard imports and local modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of data being sent to untrusted sinks; method parameters unpacked and passed to AWS API calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation; the copyright year 2025 is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a straightforward, well-structured SDK wrapper with type annotations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. This aligns well with the report's conclusion.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; standard interface and type definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling or malicious logic.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; the code is purely interface/type definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; a standard, safe SDK wrapper.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; enhances type safety for AWS MediaConvert.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Method signatures unpack kwargs into request types, passing them to AWS API calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no credentials.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK interface; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Suitable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines a client class for AWS MediaConvert.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Methods pass parameters to API; no untrusted data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical SDK interface; safe and standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (very low). Slightly higher securityRisk score might be due to the use of **kwargs, but this is standard for SDKs.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to others; provides type-safe API interaction.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Unpack with kwargs into API calls; no evidence of malicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns; usage of standard patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; a typical SDK interface.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. The slightly elevated securityRisk reflects the dynamic unpacking, but it's still standard.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code Presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard, type-annotated SDK interface for AWS MediaConvert.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports consistently find no malware or obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly elevated in some reports (0.1), likely due to the use of **kwargs and dynamic unpacking, which is typical for SDKs but can be marginally risky if misused.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, well-structured, and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 to 0.1 — very low, reflecting standard SDK patterns without vulnerabilities.\n\n**Note:** The only minor concern is the use of **kwargs and Unpack, which could, in theory, be misused if user input is not validated elsewhere. However, within the context of a well-maintained SDK, this is standard practice and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, well-typed SDK wrapper for AWS MediaConvert.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, with a slight caution on the security risk due to dynamic argument unpacking.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis reflects the code's purpose, structure, and the absence of any suspicious or malicious activity.",
