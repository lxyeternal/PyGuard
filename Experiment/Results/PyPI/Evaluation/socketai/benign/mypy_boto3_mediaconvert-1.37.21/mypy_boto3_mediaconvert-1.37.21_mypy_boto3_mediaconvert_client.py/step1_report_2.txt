{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for the AWS MediaConvert service, providing methods to interact with the service's API.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, method signatures, and property definitions within the module.",
  "sinks": "None identified that perform untrusted data handling or potentially malicious actions; mostly method signatures and type definitions.",
  "flows": "Method definitions serve as sources; actual data flow would occur during runtime API calls, but no explicit source-to-sink data flows are present in this static code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is predominantly interface and type definition; no suspicious logic, code injection, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variables are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured interface for the boto3 MediaConvert client with type annotations, method signatures, and documentation links. It imports necessary types and defines a class with various API methods and paginators. No runtime logic, data handling, or executable code that could be malicious is included. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured type stub or wrapper around boto3's client, aimed at static type checking and improved IDE support. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a type-annotated interface for AWS MediaConvert, serving as a structured API client wrapper. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It is a safe, standard, and well-structured interface definition with no security risks identified.",
