  "purpose": "Load a specific JSII assembly for AWS CDK custom resources and publish the module.",
  "sources": "Static import statements, assembly load via jsii.JSIIAssembly.load(), and publication call.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Static import and assembly load without dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; straightforward setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports, loads a fixed version of a JSII assembly from a tarball, and publishes the module. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The assembly load uses a hardcoded filename and version, which is typical in controlled infrastructure scripts. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign AWS CDK setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are consistent with its static and straightforward nature. No modifications are necessary; the code is safe and the assessments are accurate.",
