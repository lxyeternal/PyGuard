{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up imports and load a JSII assembly related to AWS CDK custom resources, likely for infrastructure as code deployment.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as aws_cdk, jsii, publication, and typeguard; loads a JSII assembly for @aws-cdk/custom-resources.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no network, file, or system modification functions are present.",
  "flows": "Imports and assembly loading are static; there are no data flows from input to output or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected. The code is straightforward and consists of standard setup for AWS CDK constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module imports, loads a JSII assembly for AWS CDK, and publishes the module. It does not include any network communication, data processing, or system modification routines. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The structure and content are typical for an SDK or library setup script, with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for AWS CDK custom resources, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not contain malware, hardcoded secrets, or insecure code patterns.",
