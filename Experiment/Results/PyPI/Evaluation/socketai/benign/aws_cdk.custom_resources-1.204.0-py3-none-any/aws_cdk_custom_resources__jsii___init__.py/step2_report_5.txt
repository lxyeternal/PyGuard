  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code performs static imports of standard, third-party, and AWS CDK modules.\n- It loads a JSII assembly from a specific tarball (`custom-resources@1.204.0.jsii.tgz`) using `jsii.JSIIAssembly.load()`.\n- It then calls `publication.publish()` to publish the module.\n\n**Key observations:**\n- All operations are static and involve no dynamic data, user input, or network activity.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The code appears to be a typical setup script for AWS CDK constructs using JSII.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is straightforward and correctly structured for its purpose.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No evidence of malicious intent or malicious code.\n- **Security risks:** Minimal; primarily related to the loading of a specific assembly and publishing, which are standard operations.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Malware:** None detected.\n\n### Analysis of each report:\nAll five reports agree on the benign nature of the code, emphasizing its role in setting up AWS CDK constructs, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Security risk score:** They assign 0.1 or 0, which seems reasonable given the static nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues with scores:**\n- The reports assign a security risk of 0.1 in most cases, possibly reflecting a very cautious stance. Given the code's static, benign nature, a score of 0 is more appropriate unless the assembly source or context suggests otherwise.\n- The malware score should remain 0; no changes needed.\n- The obfuscated score should remain 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (more appropriate than 0.1, given no malicious behavior)\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign setup script for AWS CDK custom resources, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable but could be slightly lowered to reflect the code's benign and static nature.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
