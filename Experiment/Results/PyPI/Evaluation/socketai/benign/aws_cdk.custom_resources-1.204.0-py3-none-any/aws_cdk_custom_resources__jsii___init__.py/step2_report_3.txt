  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward setup script for AWS CDK custom resources using JSII.\n- No dynamic data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present.\n- The code involves static imports, assembly loading, and publication, which are typical in CDK infrastructure code.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The assembly load uses fixed version strings and static file paths, indicating a controlled environment.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low (0.1 or 0), which is reasonable given the code's static nature and lack of external data handling.\n\n**Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n- The reports' assessments are consistent and reasonable. They correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, considering the code's static and benign nature.\n- The malware scores are zero, matching the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Challenging Assumptions:**\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are warranted here, as the code is purely infrastructural setup.\n- The assembly load and publication are standard practices; no signs of malicious payloads are evident.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- Given the code's static, non-executable setup nature, the risk and malware scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk beyond standard setup)\n\nThe reports are accurate, and their scoring is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\nBased on this review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores reflect a low-risk, standard infrastructure setup.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that assembly files loaded are from trusted sources, but in this static setup, that appears to be the case.\n\n---\n\n**Summary conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard AWS CDK setup script for custom resources.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior detected.\n- Scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
