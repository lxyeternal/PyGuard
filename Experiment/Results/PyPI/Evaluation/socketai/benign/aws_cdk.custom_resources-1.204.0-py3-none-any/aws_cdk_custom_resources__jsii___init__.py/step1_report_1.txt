{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up and load a JSII assembly for AWS CDK custom resources, facilitating integration with AWS services.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules, loads a JSII assembly from a .tgz package, and calls a publish function.",
  "sinks": "None of the imported modules or functions are used in a way that directly executes untrusted data or causes security risks.",
  "flows": "Imports → Assembly loading → Publication; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code structure is typical for setting up AWS CDK constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules, loads a JSII assembly related to AWS CDK custom resources, and publishes a module. The loading uses static file paths and version strings, with no dynamic execution or external data processing. The absence of any network activity, dynamic code execution, or untrusted input handling suggests no malicious intent or security risks. The code's purpose appears solely to facilitate AWS infrastructure setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for AWS CDK constructs using JSII; it does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It performs static imports, assembly loading, and publication, all of which are typical in CDK-based infrastructure code.",
