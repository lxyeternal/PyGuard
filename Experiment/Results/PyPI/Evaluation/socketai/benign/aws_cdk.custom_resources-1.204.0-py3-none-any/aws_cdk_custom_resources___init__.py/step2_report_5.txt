  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report states that the code defines AWS CDK constructs for custom resource providers, including policies, SDK call configurations, and response handling. The code is standard and from the AWS CDK library.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks, network connections, or data exfiltration pathways are present. Data flows are limited to internal configuration and AWS SDK calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns. The code is typical for infrastructure as code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is legitimate, with high confidence, no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n**Score for malware:** 0 (correct, no malicious code)  \n**Score for obfuscated:** 0 (clear, well-structured code)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)  \n\n**Verdict:** Valid, no issues.  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on defining constructs for custom resources and API calls, with standard data handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or network activity. Data flows are internal configuration and SDK calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is standard for AWS CDK.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent, legitimate infrastructure code.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0  \n\n**Verdict:** No issues, legitimate code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines classes for custom resources, SDK calls, policies, and provider functions. No external untrusted input is processed.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network connections or data exfiltration. Data flows are configuration and response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is a standard AWS CDK utility.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard configuration)  \n\n**Verdict:** Safe, standard infrastructure code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, defining classes for custom resources, SDK calls, policies, provider setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network activity, data exfiltration, or external leaks. Response data and policy generation are internal.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The code follows AWS CDK best practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent, legitimate AWS CDK component.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Clean, standard code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines classes and data structures for custom resources, SDK calls, policies, provider configurations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network, data leaks, or external communication. Data flows are configuration-based.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code is a typical AWS CDK implementation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0  \n\n**Verdict:** Legitimate, safe code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0 or very close to 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Final Justification:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-structured implementation of AWS CDK constructs for custom resources, SDK calls, policies, and provider management. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The detailed analysis confirms that the code is purely infrastructure-as-code, with no data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe scores assigned in the reports are accurate and reasonable given the code content.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as legitimate, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security posture is sound, and the code is standard AWS CDK infrastructure code.",
