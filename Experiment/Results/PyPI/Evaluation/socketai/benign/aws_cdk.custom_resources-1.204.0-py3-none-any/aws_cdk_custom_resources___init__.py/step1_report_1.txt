{
  "purpose": "Defines AWS CloudFormation custom resource providers and associated data structures for managing custom resources via AWS SDK calls, Lambda functions, and policies.",
  "sources": "Code reading of class definitions, method implementations, property initializations, and data structures. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "Responses from SDK calls, responses from Lambda functions, resource policy definitions, and properties that could affect AWS permissions.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from untrusted sources; data flow is limited to internal configuration and AWS SDK/API calls within managed constructs.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Code appears to be standard AWS CDK constructs for custom resources and policies.",
  "analysis": "The code implements classes for AWS CDK custom resource providers, policies, SDK call configurations, and response handling. No external input handling or dynamic code execution is present. The functions and classes are standard and intended for infrastructure-as-code deployment. No signs of obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious behavior are observed. The code is consistent with AWS CDK library patterns for managing permissions and Lambda-backed custom resources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of AWS CDK constructs for managing custom resources and policies. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, well-structured infrastructure code without any malicious intent.",
