  "purpose": "Define classes and functions for AWS CDK custom resources, including mechanisms to invoke AWS SDK calls via Lambda functions, manage resource lifecycle, and specify IAM policies.",
  "sources": "Imports of AWS CDK modules, internal class initializations, property assignments, and method definitions related to AWS SDK calls, Lambda functions, IAM roles, and resource policies.",
  "sinks": "Response data extraction methods (get_response_field, get_response_field_reference), property accessors for service token and principals, and methods that perform or generate IAM policies based on SDK call definitions.",
  "flows": "Initialization of custom resource constructs, invocation of SDK calls via Lambda functions, response data handling through get_response_field methods, and policy generation from SDK call definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code snippets are present. The code adheres to standard AWS CDK constructs and patterns for custom resources. No unusual or misleading variable names or code structures are evident. No obfuscated or intentionally misleading code features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for AWS CDK custom resource handling, including policy generation, SDK call configuration, physical ID management, and provider setup. All code constructs follow standard patterns, and there are no signs of malicious behavior. Functions perform expected operations such as creating IAM policies, invoking Lambda functions, and managing resource lifecycle, with no evidence of data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be a typical, well-structured implementation of AWS CDK custom resource utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate part of AWS CDK's custom resource framework, intended to facilitate safe interaction with AWS APIs during CloudFormation stack operations. There are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It follows expected patterns and best practices without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
