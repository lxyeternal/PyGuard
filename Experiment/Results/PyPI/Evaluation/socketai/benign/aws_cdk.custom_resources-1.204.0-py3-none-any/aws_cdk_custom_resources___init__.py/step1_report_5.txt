{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and data structures for creating and managing AWS CloudFormation custom resources using the AWS CDK framework, including handling SDK calls, policies, and provider configurations.",
  "sources": "Sources include class constructors and property initializers that set configuration properties for custom resource constructs and SDK calls.",
  "sinks": "Sinks include methods that retrieve response fields, generate IAM policies, or produce tokens for resource identifiers, which are standard for CDK constructs.",
  "flows": "Flow involves initializing resource configurations and policies, then invoking SDK calls via the custom resource framework, with response handling and permission grants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hard-coded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior are present. The code strictly defines CDK constructs and data types without any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of AWS CDK custom resource classes and related data types. It includes constructors, property getters, static methods for policy generation, and data validation via type hints. All functions perform typical configuration and resource management tasks; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network operations are present. The code does not include any suspicious operations or malicious intent; it is designed solely for infrastructure as code automation within the AWS CDK framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate part of the AWS CDK library for managing custom resources and SDK calls. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is standard, well-documented infrastructure code with no hidden or malicious logic.",
