  "purpose": "Unit tests for the param.Bytes parameter class, validating default behaviors, regex matching, and value assignment handling.",
  "sources": "Code reads class definitions, parameter initializations, and attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or outputs untrusted data; no data leaks or external effects are observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows leading to security issues are present; tests are self-contained validations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Use of regex for IP address validation is standard. No suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard unit testing for a parameter class, validating default values, regex matching, and error handling. No external data input, network communication, or file operations are involved. The code is well-structured, uses conventional testing frameworks, and does not contain suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for testing the behavior of the param.Bytes class and does not exhibit any malicious intent or security risks.",
