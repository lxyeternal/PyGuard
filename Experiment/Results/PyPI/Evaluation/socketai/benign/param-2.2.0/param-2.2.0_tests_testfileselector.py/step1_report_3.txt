  "purpose": "Unit testing for the param.FileSelector class, verifying default values, object selection, path updates, and glob pattern handling.",
  "sources": "Reading glob patterns, default file paths, and file existence checks.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or external effects; no untrusted data execution or external connections.",
  "flows": "File selectors read filesystem to populate objects; tests modify path attributes and update object lists accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic. The code is standard unit test code with filesystem interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up temporary directories and files, then tests the behavior of a parameterized FileSelector class, including defaults, object selection, path updates, and handling of glob patterns. No external network, data leakage, or malicious actions are observed. The code solely interacts with local filesystem and performs typical unit testing procedures. There are no signs of malicious backdoors, secret exfiltration, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for a parameter class with filesystem interactions, exhibiting no malicious intent or security risks.",
