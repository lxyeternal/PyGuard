  "purpose": "Unit tests for param.FileSelector functionality, testing defaults, object selection, path updates, and glob behavior.",
  "sources": "File system operations (os.path.join, open, os.remove), temporary directory creation, and test input data setup.",
  "sinks": "None observed; code mainly manipulates local files and directories for testing purposes.",
  "flows": "File and directory creation/reading during test setup; no untrusted data flows or external data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of temporary files and directories is standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines unit tests for the param.FileSelector class, involving creation and deletion of temporary files, directory globbing, and parameter setting. All file operations are local, controlled, and part of testing. No network, cryptography, or external data handling is present. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for a parameter class dealing with file selection, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It operates solely on local files and directories for testing purposes.",
