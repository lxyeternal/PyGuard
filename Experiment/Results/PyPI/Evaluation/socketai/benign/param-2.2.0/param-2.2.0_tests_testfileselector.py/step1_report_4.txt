  "purpose": "Unit tests for the param.FileSelector class, verifying default values, object selection, path updates, and glob patterns.",
  "sources": "Temporary directory creation and file writing in setUp; reading file paths and glob patterns; parameter default values and attribute updates.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted input handling or external data outputs; no network or system command executions.",
  "flows": "File creation and glob pattern matching influence object selection within param.FileSelector; updates to path trigger object list refresh.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code primarily manages test setups and parameter validation.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up temporary directories and files for testing, then exercises the FileSelector parameter's default behavior, object selection, path updates, and glob pattern handling. No dynamic execution, network access, or sensitive data handling is present. It strictly performs file system operations and parameter property checks related to the param library. No obfuscation or malware indicators are evident. The code is well-structured, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test suite for the param.FileSelector class, focusing on validating expected behaviors without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware are identified.",
