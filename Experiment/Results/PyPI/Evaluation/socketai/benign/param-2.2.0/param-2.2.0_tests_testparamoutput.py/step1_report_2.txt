  "purpose": "Unit tests for the param.output decorator and related output methods in the param library.",
  "sources": "Input sources include method definitions decorated with @param.output() and parameterized class instances. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data flows into external systems or causes data leaks. No network or file I/O involved.",
  "flows": "The code defines output methods and inspects the outputs dictionary, but does not process untrusted data or perform data flows that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses no dynamic execution, obfuscated language features, or unusual constructs. All code appears straightforward and related to unit testing.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a series of unit tests for a parameter library's output decorator, verifying output registration, type assignment, and handling of multiple outputs. There are no indications of code injection, malicious logic, or external communication. The focus is solely on method decorations, output registrations, and parameter type assertions within test classes. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The structure is standard for unit tests, and all functions perform typical assertions without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of unit tests for the param library's output mechanisms with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It contains no suspicious or harmful behavior, and the design aligns with typical testing practices.",
