  "purpose": "Unit tests for the param.output decorator and output management in the param library.",
  "sources": "Code reads class definitions, method decorators, method calls, and attribute accesses within test cases.",
  "sinks": "Method calls and attribute access that process outputs; no untrusted data processing or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Test definitions -> decorator processing -> output registration and retrieval; no external or untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs detected. The code structure is typical for unit tests and follows standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple unit tests to verify the behavior of the param.output decorator, including handling of various argument forms, inheritance, and error conditions. The code strictly tests output registration and retrieval mechanisms without any external data interaction or suspicious logic. No malicious patterns, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. All class and method definitions follow expected patterns, with no obfuscated or suspicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard unit testing for the param library's output decorator. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are detected. It appears to be safe, well-structured test code with no security issues.",
