  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe unit tests for the `param.output` decorator in the `param` library.\n- They involve class definitions, method decorators, output registration, and assertions.\n- No external data, network activity, or untrusted input processing is involved.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or anomalies are detected.\n- The purpose is to verify correct registration and behavior of output parameters.\n\n**Malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior. Given the code's nature—standard unit tests for a library—this is appropriate. The code does not execute any external commands, process untrusted data, or contain any malicious payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is correct. The code is straightforward, readable, and uses standard patterns.\n\n- **Security risk:** All reports assign a score of 0. The code is purely for testing internal library functions, with no external dependencies or security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n- The code is purely testing code; it does not process untrusted inputs, perform external communications, or execute dynamic code that could be exploited.\n- The tests are comprehensive for the `param.output` decorator but do not introduce any vulnerabilities.\n\n**Scores justification:**\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe provided code is a standard, safe set of unit tests for the `param.output` decorator. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in each report are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and solely intended for testing library functionality.",
