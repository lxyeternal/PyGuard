  "purpose": "Unit tests for the param.output decorator in the param library, verifying output parameter registration and behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads class definitions, method decorators, and function return values within test methods.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used or data leaks occur.",
  "flows": "Input is class/method definitions -> decorators register outputs -> tests verify output registration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a series of unittests for the param library's output decorator. It tests various ways of declaring outputs, including positional, named, typed, and multiple outputs. The tests verify that the outputs are correctly registered and associated with the appropriate methods and types. The code strictly performs testing of decorator behavior and output registration without executing untrusted code or interacting with external systems. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The code appears safe, standard, and solely intended for testing the library functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a comprehensive set of unit tests for param.output, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It is safe and intended for verifying library functionality.",
