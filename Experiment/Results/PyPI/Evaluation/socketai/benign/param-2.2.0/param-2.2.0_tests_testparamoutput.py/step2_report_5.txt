  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Anomalies:**  \n   All reports explicitly state that the code is standard unit testing code for the `param.output` decorator, with no obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors detected. The code involves class definitions, method decorations, and assertions—all typical for testing library functionality.\n\n2. **Code Functionality & Data Flow:**  \n   The code constructs parameterized classes, applies the decorator, and verifies the registration of outputs. There are no external data sources, network calls, or processing of untrusted inputs. The flow is straightforward: define, decorate, instantiate, retrieve outputs, and assert correctness.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Vulnerabilities:**  \n   Since the code is solely for testing internal behavior of a library, and no external or untrusted inputs are involved, the likelihood of security issues is negligible. The reports correctly identify that there are no data leaks, no external command executions, and no suspicious constructs.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Malware: 0  \n   - Obfuscated: 0  \n   - Security Risk: 0  \n   \n   These are appropriate given the analysis. The purpose is purely to verify internal library behavior, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n5. **Potential for False Positives or Overestimation:**  \n   No report suggests any assumptions that could lead to overestimating risk. The code is transparent and well-understood.\n\n**Summary & Final Justification:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**. No malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**. Code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Should remain at **0**. No security risks are identified; the code is purely for testing.\n\n**Overall:**  \nThe provided reports are accurate and conservative in their assessments. The code is safe, standard, and intended solely for testing the param library's output registration mechanism.\n\n---\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent with the code's nature. No changes are necessary. The code is safe, with no security concerns.",
