  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if there are any security concerns, malware, obfuscation, or inconsistencies in the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a comprehensive, standard unit test suite for the `param.Selector` parameter.\n- No report indicates any suspicious code, such as network activity, file I/O, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- The code relies solely on standard testing libraries (`unittest`, `pytest`) and the `param` library.\n- The purpose is to verify parameter defaults, inheritance, bounds, and behavior, not to perform any malicious activity.\n- The malware score across all reports is 0, and the obfuscated score is 0.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 0.9+), reflecting strong agreement that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in the code:** No issues or vulnerabilities are identified.\n- **Malicious activity or backdoors:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or unusual language features.\n- **Sensitive data or data leaks:** None present.\n- **External communication or system modifications:** Not present.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** The tests are straightforward, verifying expected behavior.\n\n### Logical and scoring review:\n- The **malware score** is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- The **security risk score** is 0, matching the analysis.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since all reports agree, and the code is purely a test suite with no malicious intent, the current scores are appropriate.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Aspect             | Estimated Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| **Malware**       | **0**           |\n| **Obfuscated**    | **0**           |\n| **Risk**          | **0**           |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a standard, well-structured unit test suite for the `param.Selector` parameter, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scoring accurately reflects its benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that test code remains isolated and does not perform any system modifications or external communications in production environments. In this case, the code adheres to those principles.",
