{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive unit test suite for the 'param.Selector' parameter, verifying default values, inheritance, bounds, 'allow_None' behavior, and object sharing. It aims to ensure correct parameter behavior and validation.",
  "sources": "Class and instance attribute definitions, particularly 'param.Selector' parameters, and test assertions on their states and behaviors.",
  "sinks": "In-memory assertions and parameter assignments; no external data handling, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Source data flows from parameter definitions and object initializations to assertions and validation checks within the test methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual constructs are present. The code is straightforward and standard for unit testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured test suite for 'param.Selector', testing default behaviors, inheritance, bounds, 'allow_None' handling, and object sharing. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The use of 'pytest.mark.xfail' is a standard testing pattern. No external data, network activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code relies solely on standard testing libraries and the 'param' library, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The analysis indicates a benign, purely functional testing code with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured unit test suite for 'param.Selector' with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores should be set to zero across malware, obfuscated, and risk metrics, consistent with the analysis.",
