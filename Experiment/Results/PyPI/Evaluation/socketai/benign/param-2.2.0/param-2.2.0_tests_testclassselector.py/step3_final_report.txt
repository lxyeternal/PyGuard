{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for the param library's ClassSelector and Dict parameter classes, validating default values, type enforcement, and error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from parameter instantiations and method calls within the test cases, primarily validating parameter values and types.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that lead to data leaks, external system calls, or malicious actions; the code only performs assertions and exception checks.",
  "flows": "Input data (valid and invalid parameter values) flows through validation checks, triggering exceptions or setting attributes, with no external data or network flow involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for unit testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying default behaviors, type validation, and error handling for parameter classes. It contains no network activity, data leaks, or malicious logic. Exception messages and validation logic are consistent with expected behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified given the benign and validation-focused nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for parameter validation with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
