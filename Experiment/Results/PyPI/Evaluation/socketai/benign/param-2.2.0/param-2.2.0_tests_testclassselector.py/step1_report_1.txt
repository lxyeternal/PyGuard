{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the param.ClassSelector and param.Dict parameter classes in the param library.",
  "sources": "Code reads class types, class instances, and dictionaries through parameter assignments and method calls.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe assignments to parameter attributes; no direct data leak or system effect observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., class types, instances, dictionaries) flows into parameter constructors and assignments, but only for testing validation logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors; code performs validation and testing of parameter behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines unit tests for parameter validation classes, checking defaults, type enforcement, and error handling. It involves standard Python features, class and type checks, and exception testing. No network activity, system modifications, or data leaks are present. Usage of the param library is solely for testing purposes. No obfuscation or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of unit tests for the param library's parameter classes, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It focuses on validation and default checks within a testing context.",
