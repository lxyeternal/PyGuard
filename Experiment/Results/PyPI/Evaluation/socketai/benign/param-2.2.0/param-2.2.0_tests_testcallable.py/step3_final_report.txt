  "purpose": "This code tests that param.Callable enforces its argument to be a callable object, raising a ValueError if not.",
  "sources": "The code reads the hardcoded string 'wrong' as input to param.Callable.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code only raises an exception for invalid input.",
  "flows": "Input 'wrong' (source) flows into param.Callable, which triggers a ValueError (sink) if invalid.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward validation test with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports param and pytest, then defines a test that asserts passing a string to param.Callable raises a ValueError with a specific message. It is a standard validation test with no external data, network activity, or malicious behavior. The test's purpose is to verify input validation enforcement. No obfuscation, malware, or security risks are present. The code is clear, simple, and correctly implemented. The exception message confirms the validation logic. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test verifying that param.Callable enforces callable inputs. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
