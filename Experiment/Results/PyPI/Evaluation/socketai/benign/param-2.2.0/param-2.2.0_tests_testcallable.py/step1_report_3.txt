{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test case intended to verify that a parameter of type 'Callable' correctly raises an exception when initialized with an invalid type (string).",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the string 'wrong' passed to param.Callable.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the source ('wrong') into the param.Callable constructor, which is expected to validate the input and raise an exception if invalid.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code patterns are present. The use of pytest.raises for testing exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'param' and 'pytest', then defines a test function that asserts an exception is raised when 'param.Callable' is initialized with a string instead of a callable object. This is typical unit test behavior, with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious activity. There are no external data inputs, no network or file operations, and no obfuscated code. It solely tests for proper validation within the 'param' library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test verifying parameter validation behavior and contains no malicious code or security risks.",
