{
  "purpose": "The code defines a test function to verify the behavior of param.Callable when initialized with an invalid string input.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'pytest' library, the 'param' library, and the string 'wrong' used as an argument in param.Callable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data for output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Input string 'wrong' flows into the param.Callable constructor, which then triggers a ValueError that is caught by pytest.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard testing practices, and the param.Callable class is used as intended to validate input types.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the param and pytest libraries, then defines a test function that asserts a ValueError is raised when param.Callable is initialized with a string. The test checks that the proper exception and message are generated, indicating that param.Callable enforces callable objects only. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs present. The code appears to be a straightforward unit test for validation logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test verifying that param.Callable correctly rejects non-callable inputs. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
