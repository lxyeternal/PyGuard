  "purpose": "This code defines static version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, with no dynamic or external data handling.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static version strings and tuples; conditional import for type hints.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input is processed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static code with standard version variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, auto-generated version info snippet with static variables, no runtime data, external input, or malicious logic. It correctly uses conditional type hint imports and assigns version info directly. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious behavior are present. The code's purpose is purely declarative, serving as version metadata. All signals indicate benign, standard package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version management snippet with no security concerns. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
