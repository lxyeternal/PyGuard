  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, primarily for use with setuptools_scm to manage package versions.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples, and conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only assigns static values and performs conditional imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The TYPE_CHECKING conditional is standard for type hinting compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose is to set and define version information for a Python package. It conditionally imports typing constructs only during type checking and assigns version strings and tuples with static values. No dynamic code execution, external data input, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to common practices for version management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version definition for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
