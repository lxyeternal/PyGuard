{
  "purpose": "This code defines version-related variables for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage package versioning and type checking.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and version tuple variables; import statement within the TYPE_CHECKING conditional.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or potential data leaks; no sinks that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; simple variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains conditional type annotations, but nothing unusual or suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines version information variables for package management, with conditional import for type checking. It does not perform any operations beyond variable assignments. No external data is read at runtime, nor are there any suspicious or malicious functions. The presence of version info and type hints suggests standard package setup code generated by setuptools_scm. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard package version management code generated by setuptools_scm. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
