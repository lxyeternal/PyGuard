  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage package versioning.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and version tuple variables; conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data output or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "Assigns static version information to variables, no untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Contains no malicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward version assignment logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard versioning module auto-generated by setuptools_scm. It conditionally imports type hints for static analysis but primarily assigns static version strings and tuples. No input/output, network, or data processing occurs. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign auto-generated version information module with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves a versioning purpose with no potential for abuse.",
