{
  "purpose": "This code defines version-related variables for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to track and specify the package version.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded version strings and type hints within the module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A – there are no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the version strings are statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a conditional import based on TYPE_CHECKING for type hints, which is standard. No unusual or obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily assigns static version information and defines type hints for development purposes. It contains no dynamic execution, external data input, or network activity. The structure is straightforward, with no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign version declaration snippet generated by setuptools_scm, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
