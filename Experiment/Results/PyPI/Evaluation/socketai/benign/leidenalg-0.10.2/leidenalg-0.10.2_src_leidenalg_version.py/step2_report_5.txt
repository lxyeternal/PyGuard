  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the associated code to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a standard auto-generated version management snippet from setuptools_scm.\n- It defines version variables (`version`, `__version__`, `__version_tuple__`, `version_tuple`) with static values.\n- It uses a conditional import for type hints (`TYPE_CHECKING`) — a common pattern.\n- No external data, user input, or network activity.\n- No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no malicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and auto-generated.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning?**  \n  No. The reports accurately describe the code as a typical versioning snippet with no security concerns.\n\n- **Scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk):**  \n  All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, and security risk as 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. The code is static, does not process external data, and has no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The **malware score** is correctly 0. There's no malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** is correctly 0. The code is straightforward.\n- The **security risk score** is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The reasoning is sound; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made.\n- The code does not warrant any higher scores or concern.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThe code is a standard, auto-generated version info module with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are correct. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that. No further action or concern is necessary.",
