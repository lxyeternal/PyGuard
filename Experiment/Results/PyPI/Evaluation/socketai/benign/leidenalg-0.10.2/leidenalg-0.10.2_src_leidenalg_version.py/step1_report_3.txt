  "purpose": "Define version information for the package, generated by setuptools_scm, for version control and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuple, importing type hints within a TYPE_CHECKING block.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code. The use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward auto-generated version definition. It sets version variables using static strings and tuples, includes a conditional import for type annotations, and does not perform any runtime data processing, external network calls, or file operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version info file with no malicious intent or security risks.",
