{
  "purpose": "This package implements the Leiden algorithm in C++ and exposes it to Python, providing methods for graph partitioning and optimization routines.",
  "sources": "Imports functions and classes from local modules (.functions, .Optimiser, .VertexPartition, .version). No external or user input sources are directly evident in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "The code mainly defines imports and class/function exposure without any runtime data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and typical for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a module import and class definition setup for a graph analysis package. It imports various functions and classes from local modules, exposing them for external use. There are no input sources, data processing, or sink operations present in this snippet. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, file operations, or secret handling, are evident. The structure and content are consistent with a normal open-source graph clustering library.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package setup for a Leiden algorithm implementation. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this fragment. It primarily exposes functions and classes for graph partitioning. Overall, the code shows no malicious or security concerns.",
