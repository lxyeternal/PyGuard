  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the evidence presented, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The report states that the code is a straightforward import and interface setup, with no suspicious behavior, external data processing, or malicious constructs. The confidence is high (0.9), and all scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) are zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely import statements and documentation, with no dynamic execution or external data handling. The conclusion aligns with the evidence.\n\n- **Score suggestion:** The malware and obfuscated scores are justified as 0. Given the benign nature, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is just import statements and documentation, with no suspicious activity or external data handling. Confidence is perfect (1), malware and risk scores are zero.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the code is an interface module with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Score suggestion:** No change needed; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, the code is just import statements and documentation, with no dynamic code, external data, or suspicious constructs. Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1), but no malware or obfuscation.\n\n- **Assessment:** The minimal securityRisk score seems to be a cautious acknowledgment that this is a package setup, not executing any code that could be malicious.\n\n- **Score suggestion:** The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate. The securityRisk score of 0.1 is reasonable, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports, no signs of malicious activity, no data flows, no external inputs, no suspicious code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the code is a benign package initializer.\n\n- **Score suggestion:** No change needed; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above—import statements and class exposures, no malicious behavior or data handling.\n\n- **Assessment:** The evidence supports a benign interpretation.\n\n- **Score suggestion:** No change needed; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports agree that the code is a benign, interface-only module with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data flows. The malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the evidence. The minor securityRisk score in some reports (0.1) is reasonable, given the package's role as an interface without execution of untrusted code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk score:** **0.0 to 0.1** (very low, given the nature of the code)\n\n**Note:** Since the code is purely an import module with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions, the scores reflect a very low security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications are necessary. The code is a standard, benign package interface for a graph clustering library, with no malicious or security risks evident.",
