{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface module exposing the Leiden clustering algorithm implemented in C++ to Python, primarily through import statements and documentation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules, such as functions, classes, and version info.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network communication, or data leaks; no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "The code does not process data at runtime; it only imports components for use elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs; straightforward import setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package initializer, importing functions, classes, and version info for a graph clustering library. It contains no dynamic execution, external data handling, or malicious patterns. The documentation describes usage but does not execute code. The absence of runtime logic or external interactions indicates a benign, interface-only module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, open-source package interface with no malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible (~0). The reports are accurate and consistent; no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
