{
  "purpose": "This package implements the Leiden algorithm in C++ and exposes it to Python, providing graph clustering and partitioning functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports functions and classes from local modules (.functions, .Optimiser, .VertexPartition, .version) and loads version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "N/A – The code primarily imports modules and defines interface, with no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module import and class definition script for a graph clustering package. It imports multiple functions and classes for partitioning and optimization routines. There are no network calls, file I/O, or data handling that could indicate malicious activity. The comments provide usage examples, but no suspicious logic or behavior is present. The code does not process external input directly, nor does it produce external outputs, which minimizes the risk of malicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, benign Python interface for a Leiden clustering library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on its content.",
