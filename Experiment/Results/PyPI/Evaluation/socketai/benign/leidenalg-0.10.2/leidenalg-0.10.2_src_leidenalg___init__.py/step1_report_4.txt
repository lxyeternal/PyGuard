{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python interface for a C++ implementation of the Leiden clustering algorithm, exposing various classes, functions, and modules related to graph partitioning and optimization.",
  "sources": "Import statements for functions, classes, and modules within the package such as .functions, .Optimiser, .VertexPartition, and .version.",
  "sinks": "No clear untrusted data sinks are present. The code does not handle input/output operations, external data streams, or untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable—there are no source-to-sink data flows; the code primarily imports modules and defines package interface components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The comments are informative and describe the package purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package __init__.py style module that imports various functions, classes, and constants to expose an API for the package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as dynamic code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration. It appears to be a typical setup for a scientific computing library focusing on graph partitioning algorithms. The code does not process untrusted inputs or include any suspicious or hidden code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization file that imports and exposes functions and classes related to graph clustering algorithms. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this code.",
