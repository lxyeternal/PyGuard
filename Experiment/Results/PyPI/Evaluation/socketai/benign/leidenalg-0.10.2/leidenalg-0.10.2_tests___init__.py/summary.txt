  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates that Report 2's code shows strong indicators of malicious behavior, warranting high malware and security risk scores. Other reports are consistent with low or moderate suspicion. The scores are justified based on the provided signals, and no adjustments are necessary. Further review should focus on actual code snippets to confirm suspicions."
