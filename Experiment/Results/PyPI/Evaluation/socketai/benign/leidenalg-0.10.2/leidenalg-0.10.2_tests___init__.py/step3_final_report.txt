  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network connections, file reads, dynamic code execution (eval()/exec()), hardcoded credentials, complex variable names, suspicious strings.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, system commands, environment variables, output functions (print/logs).",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into code execution or network transmission points, potentially leading to data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec(), hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code segments, suspicious domain/IP references, obscure variable names, dynamic code patterns, inconsistent or misleading variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical indicators of malicious intent in Report 2, including eval(), hardcoded credentials, network activity, and obfuscation, justifying high malware (0.8), obfuscation (0.7), and security risk (0.85) scores. Reports 3 and 5 show signs of obfuscation and suspicion but lack concrete malicious code, leading to moderate scores (0.3-0.5). Reports 1 and 4 contain no suspicious activity, reflected in zero or low scores. The scoring aligns with the described behaviors, with high suspicion in Report 2 appropriately justified and other reports consistent with benign or cautious assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates that Report 2's code shows strong indicators of malicious behavior, warranting high malware and security risk scores. Other reports are consistent with low or moderate suspicion. The scores are justified based on the provided signals, and no adjustments are necessary. Further review should focus on actual code snippets to confirm suspicions.",
