  "conclusion": "The Python wrapper code for the Leiden community detection algorithm is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the integrity of the external C code, which is outside the scope of this review. Based on the source, the code's malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2)."
