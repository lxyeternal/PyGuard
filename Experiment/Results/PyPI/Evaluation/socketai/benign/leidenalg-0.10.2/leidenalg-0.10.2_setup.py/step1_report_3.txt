  "purpose": "Setup script for building a Python extension module 'leidenalg._c_leiden' with optional ABI compatibility, including version checks and configuration for compiling C++ sources.",
  "sources": "Python environment variables (sys.version_info, platform.python_implementation), file system (glob.glob), environment and system info for build configuration.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks observed; the script primarily performs configuration and setup without executing external commands or handling external inputs.",
  "flows": "Uses system info and environment variables to determine build parameters and configure compilation; no untrusted data flows to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. The code strictly handles build configuration without external network or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script checks Python version, conditionally modifies build commands for wheel compatibility, and configures compilation parameters for C++ extensions. It uses glob to find source files and sets macros based on environment conditions. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, no code injection, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python C++ extension module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical build configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs environment checks and configures extension compilation safely. No security risks or malicious intent are evident.",
