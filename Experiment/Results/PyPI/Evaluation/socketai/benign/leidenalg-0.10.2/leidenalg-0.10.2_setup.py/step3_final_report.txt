  "purpose": "Setup script for building the 'leidenalg' Python extension with C++ sources, including environment validation and platform-specific configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads environment info, platform details, filesystem for source files, and build environment variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; primarily configures build parameters.",
  "flows": "Environment and platform info → build configuration → setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard environment checks, conditional macro definitions, and setup for compiling C++ extensions. It uses common Python build tools and platform modules without dynamic code execution or external network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign build configuration file for a Python C++ extension module. It contains no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
