{
  "purpose": "The script configures the setup process for a Python package with C++ extensions, handling version compatibility and optional wheel building.",
  "sources": "Reading system information (sys.version_info, platform.python_implementation), globbing source files from 'src/leidenalg/*.cpp', and importing modules such as os, platform, sys, glob, and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if malicious input influences file paths or environment variables, it could affect the build process, but no explicit untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script mainly gathers system info, constructs build configurations, and invokes setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The use of standard build tools and environment checks appears typical.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment validation (Python version, implementation), conditionally modifies build parameters (abi3 support), and sets up a C++ extension module for packaging. All operations involve local file paths and system info without external input influence. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard build configuration for a Python package extension, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on local source files and system info, with no evident malicious data handling.",
