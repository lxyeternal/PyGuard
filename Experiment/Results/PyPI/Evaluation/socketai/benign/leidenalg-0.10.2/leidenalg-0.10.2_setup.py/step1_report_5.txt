  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with C++ extension modules, ensuring compatibility and build configuration.",
  "sources": "Python version check, import statements, glob for source files, platform info, environment variables for build configuration.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe environment variables or external configuration if exploited, but none are directly used here.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data sources are processed into sensitive sinks; the script primarily configures build parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed. The code uses standard setup procedures, conditional build logic, and platform checks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment and version checks, conditionally modifies build commands, and defines extension modules using standard setuptools and distutils practices. No hardcoded secrets, no network connections, and no suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The use of conditional macros and build parameters is typical for compiling C++ extensions, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate build configuration for a Python package with native extensions. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks identified.",
