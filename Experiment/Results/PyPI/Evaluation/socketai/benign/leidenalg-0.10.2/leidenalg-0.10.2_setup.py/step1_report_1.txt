{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for building and installing a Python extension module, specifically for a package named 'leidenalg'. It configures compilation settings and build options based on environment conditions.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (platform, sys.version_info, platform.python_implementation), filesystem for glob.glob, and user input indirectly via build process.",
  "sinks": "Uses glob.glob to gather source files, and setup() to compile extensions. No untrusted data is directly processed in a way that affects system security.",
  "flows": "Environment info -> decision logic for build configuration -> setup() call for compiling extension module.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with environment checks to ensure compatible Python version. It then attempts to import 'bdist_wheel' and conditionally defines a custom wheel build class for ABI3 compatibility. Based on environment and platform info, it configures build macros and command classes. The setup() function prepares a C++ extension module, specifying source files, include and library directories, and build macros. The overall flow is standard for a Python C extension build script. No malicious code, network activity, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard build configuration for a Python extension module, with environment-based customization. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
