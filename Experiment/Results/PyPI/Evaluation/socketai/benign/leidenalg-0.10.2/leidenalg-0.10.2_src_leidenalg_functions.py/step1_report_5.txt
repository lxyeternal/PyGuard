{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for community detection in various types of graphs (single, multiplex, temporal) using the Leiden algorithm, along with helper functions for graph transformations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as graphs, vertex attributes, edge attributes, and optional initializations like weights and seed values.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that send data over networks, write to files, or perform other external side effects. It mainly manipulates graphs and attributes internally.",
  "flows": "Input graphs and attributes flow into functions that create partitions, perform optimizations, or convert graph structures. No untrusted external data flow to system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code uses standard graph operations and community detection algorithms without suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of community detection functions for different graph structures, including multiplex and temporal graphs. It uses standard graph operations, such as disjoint union, subgraph extraction, and attribute assignment. No external network activity, credential handling, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be a well-structured library for graph community analysis, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of community detection algorithms and graph transformations with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It performs internal computations on graph data, with no external communication or suspicious modifications.",
