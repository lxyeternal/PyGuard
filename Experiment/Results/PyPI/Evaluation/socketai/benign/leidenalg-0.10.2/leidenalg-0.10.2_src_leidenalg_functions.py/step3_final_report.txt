{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for community detection, graph transformations, and handling multiplex and temporal graphs within the igraph framework, primarily for network analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "Graph data structures, vertex and edge attributes, seed values, and user-supplied parameters for community detection algorithms.",
  "sinks": "Internal modifications to graph attributes, creation of subgraphs, and attribute assignments; no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input graph structures and parameters through functions that modify or analyze these graphs, culminating in community partition outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Operations are standard for graph analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard community detection and graph manipulation tasks, including disjoint unions, attribute handling, and conversion between different graph representations. It uses well-known igraph functions and patterns, with no external communication or malicious payloads. The use of optional seed values and attribute manipulations are typical in such libraries and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, benign, and intended for network analysis. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the malware score should remain at 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
