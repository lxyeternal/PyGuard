  "purpose": "Configuration setup for generating documentation for the 'leidenalg' Python package using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Import of 'os' module; dynamic retrieval of package version via 'pkg_resources.get_distribution'; environment variable check for 'READTHEDOCS'; import of 'sphinx_rtd_theme' for local HTML theme setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check to determine theme setting; version retrieval from installed package; path setup for static files and themes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code are observed. The code strictly pertains to documentation configuration. No dynamic code execution or input handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no evidence of malicious behavior. It imports basic modules, sets up paths, themes, and document options, and includes a setup for testing imports. The environment variable check is for theming purposes only, not for malicious control. The version info is retrieved securely from the installed package. No network, file, or data exfiltration behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate configuration script for documentation generation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard setup with no suspicious behavior.",
