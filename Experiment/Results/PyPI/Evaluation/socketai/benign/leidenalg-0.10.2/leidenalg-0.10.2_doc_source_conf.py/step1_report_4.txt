  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation setup for the 'leidenalg' project.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`import os`, `from pkg_resources import get_distribution`), environment variable check (`READTHEDOCS`), and the `doctest_global_setup` string.",
  "sinks": "None present. No untrusted data is processed in a manner that leads to code execution, data leakage, or network communication.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable to determine theme setting is benign; no hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. The `doctest_global_setup` string imports packages but does not execute code. No suspicious code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation with typical setup for extensions, themes, paths, and output options. It checks environment variables to set themes dynamically, which is common in documentation builds. There are no functions, external data processing, or network calls. The only dynamic content is the version retrieval via `pkg_resources`, which is standard. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only sets up documentation parameters and environment-dependent themes.",
