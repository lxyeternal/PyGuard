  "purpose": "Configuration and setup script for generating project documentation using Sphinx for the 'leidenalg' package.",
  "sources": "Imports os, get_distribution from pkg_resources, environment variable 'READTHEDOCS', and doctest_global_setup string.",
  "sinks": "None detected. No data flow to external systems, no untrusted input handling, no network connections, no file writes or data exfiltration shown.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified. The environment variable check influences theme selection but does not introduce malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'del get_distribution' after retrieving the version appears unnecessary but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The doctest_global_setup imports external packages, which is typical in tests, but does not imply malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent. It sets up project documentation parameters, environment-based theme selection, and doctest setup. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The only minor concern is the removal of the 'get_distribution' function after use, which does not affect security. The 'doctest_global_setup' imports third-party packages ('igraph' and 'leidenalg') for testing purposes, consistent with normal testing practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical configuration file for documentation generation with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions solely for project documentation setup.",
