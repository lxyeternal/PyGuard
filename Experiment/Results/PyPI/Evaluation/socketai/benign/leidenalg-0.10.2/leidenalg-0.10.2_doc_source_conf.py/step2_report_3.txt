  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as a standard Sphinx configuration script for the 'leidenalg' project.\n- The code imports standard modules (`os`, `pkg_resources.get_distribution`), uses environment variables for theme selection, retrieves package version info, and sets up documentation parameters.\n- No report mentions any suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration.\n- The only dynamic operations are environment variable checks and version retrieval, which are common in build scripts.\n- The `doctest_global_setup` imports third-party packages, which is typical for testing, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the original; no modifications or malicious alterations are detected.\n- **Malicious activity:** None of the reports find evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- **Security risks:** None identified; all operations are standard configuration steps.\n- **Potential anomalies:** The use of `del get_distribution` is unnecessary but harmless; no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Scores Evaluation:\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | No malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard setup. |\n| 2       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | Same as above; standard environment variable check and version retrieval. |\n| 3       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | No suspicious code; purely configuration. |\n| 4       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. |\n| 5       | 0              | 0                 | 0            | Standard setup, no risks detected. |\n\n**All reports correctly assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.**\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- None of the reports justify higher scores because there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The highest confidence is that this is a benign configuration script.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical, well-structured Sphinx configuration file with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- No changes needed; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This analysis is based solely on the provided code and reports. No hidden malicious payloads or backdoors are detected in this context.",
