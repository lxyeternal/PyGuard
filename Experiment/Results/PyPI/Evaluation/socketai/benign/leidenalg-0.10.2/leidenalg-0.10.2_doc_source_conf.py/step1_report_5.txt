  "purpose": "Configuration script for building Sphinx documentation for the leidenalg project.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (READTHEDOCS), imports 'os', and calls 'get_distribution' from pkg_resources to retrieve package version.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or malicious output; environment variables are used only for configuration, and package info is retrieved securely.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'READTHEDOCS' influences theme selection; 'get_distribution' obtains package version info; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks indicating malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The code is standard for a Sphinx documentation setup. No obfuscated or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file that sets up documentation parameters, theme selection based on environment variables, and imports necessary modules. It uses 'pkg_resources' to get package version info securely. There are no inputs from untrusted sources or code execution points that could be malicious. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. Overall, the code appears to be a benign configuration script with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It primarily manages documentation build settings, with no external or untrusted data flows that could lead to security issues.",
