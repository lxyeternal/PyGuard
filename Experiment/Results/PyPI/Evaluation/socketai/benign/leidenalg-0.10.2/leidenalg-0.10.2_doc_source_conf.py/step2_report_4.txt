  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file for the 'leidenalg' project.\n- It imports standard modules (`os`, `pkg_resources.get_distribution`), sets up paths, themes, and project info.\n- Uses environment variable `READTHEDOCS` to determine theme.\n- Retrieves package version via `get_distribution`.\n- Sets static paths, extensions, and other documentation options.\n- Contains a `doctest_global_setup` string that imports third-party packages (`igraph`, `leidenalg`).\n\n---\n\n### 1. Review of the first report\n\n**Findings:**\n- No malicious behavior, no data flows, no suspicious code.\n- The use of `del get_distribution` is unnecessary but benign.\n- The imports in `doctest_global_setup` are standard for testing.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — correct.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.\n- Risk: 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Review of the second report\n\n**Findings:**\n- Standard environment variable check for theme.\n- Retrieves version info via `get_distribution`.\n- No suspicious code or external data leaks.\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — correct.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.\n- Risk: 0 — no security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Review of the third report\n\n**Findings:**\n- Similar to previous; environment variable for theme, version retrieval.\n- No malicious activity or suspicious code.\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — correct.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk: 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Review of the fourth report\n\n**Findings:**\n- Same pattern: environment variable, version retrieval, static paths.\n- No suspicious code, no external data leaks.\n- Confidence: 1\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk: 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Review of the fifth report\n\n**Findings:**\n- Same as others; standard configuration, environment variable check, version info.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0.\n- Obfuscated: 0.\n- Risk: 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code's nature, this score should remain 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation is present; scores are correctly 0.\n- **Risk score:** The code is a standard configuration file with no security risks; scores are correctly 0.\n\n**However, considering the overall context:**\n\n- The code is a benign Sphinx configuration file.\n- No signs of supply chain attack, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- The only dynamic aspect is retrieving package version info, which is standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The current scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a typical, harmless configuration script with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should remain at 0 across malware, obfuscated, and risk categories.",
