{
  "purpose": "This code is a configuration file for building project documentation using Sphinx, primarily setting up documentation parameters and themes for the 'leidenalg' project.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('READTHEDOCS'), imports from standard libraries (os, pkg_resources), and executes 'get_distribution' from pkg_resources to determine the package version.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variable 'READTHEDOCS' to determine theme setup; imports and calls 'get_distribution' to retrieve package version; sets static paths for static files.",
  "flows": "Reads environment variable to decide theme configuration -> Executes 'get_distribution' to get package version -> Sets static paths based on configuration",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. Usage of environment variable for build environment detection is standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or data exfiltration evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration script for documentation. It imports standard modules, configures paths, themes, and project information. The only dynamic operation is retrieving the package version via 'get_distribution' from 'pkg_resources', which is standard for versioning documentation. Environment variable checks are used to determine the theme setup for readthedocs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain attacks. All operations serve legitimate purposes related to documentation building.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration file for documentation generation, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It correctly manages paths, themes, and project info without any suspicious or malicious code. Overall, it appears safe.",
