{
  "purpose": "This code is a configuration script for setting up Sphinx documentation for the 'leidenalg' project, defining extensions, paths, themes, and project metadata.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'READTHEDOCS' for theme selection; 'pkg_resources.get_distribution' for version info; standard library imports ('os'); static paths and extension lists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or external data leaks; configuration parameters are set internally.",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences theme choice; version info retrieved via package distribution; static paths and options are assigned directly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'del get_distribution' after version retrieval is unnecessary but harmless; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with typical imports and environment checks. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The environment variable check for theme selection is common, and package version retrieval is standard practice. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden logic. The 'del' statement is redundant but does not impact security. All signals indicate benign configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard documentation configuration script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk are correctly set to 0.",
