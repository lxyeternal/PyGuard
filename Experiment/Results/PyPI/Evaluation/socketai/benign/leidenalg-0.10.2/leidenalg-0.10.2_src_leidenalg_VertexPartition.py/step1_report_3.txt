{
  "purpose": "Define various classes for graph partitioning and community detection, including implementations for modularity, surprise, significance, and resolution parameter-based methods.",
  "sources": "Imports igraph as _ig, local modules _c_leiden and _get_py_capsule, and class methods that interact with external graph data and internal C-level functions.",
  "sinks": "Methods that call _c_leiden functions, which may process graph data and partitions; no direct sinks for untrusted input data leading to system effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like memberships, weights, node sizes, and graph data are passed to internal C functions; no flow leads from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of external C functions (_c_leiden) for graph partition manipulations; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behavior observed; code structure is complex but appears standard for scientific computation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides class definitions for various community detection and graph partitioning algorithms, heavily relying on internal C functions (_c_leiden). The methods mainly wrap these functions, managing data structures and parameters. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden network activity is present. The purpose is algorithmic and analytical, with no evident malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms. It does not perform file modifications, network connections, or data exfiltration. The code's complexity is typical for a scientific library and does not suggest malicious intent. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard scientific Python library for graph community detection, with heavy reliance on internal C functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The code is complex but structurally typical for its purpose, and no malicious signals are detected.",
