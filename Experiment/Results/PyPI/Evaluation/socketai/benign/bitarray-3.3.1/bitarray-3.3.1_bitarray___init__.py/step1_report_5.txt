{
  "purpose": "Define immutable 'frozenbitarray' class and utility functions for bitarray manipulations, including size calculation and testing.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules and the __init__ method of 'frozenbitarray', 'bits2bytes' function, and 'test' function calling external test suite.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as no untrusted data handling, network, or file system operations are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code; the code mainly consists of class and function definitions with standard operations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a class for an immutable bit array and utility functions. It imports modules, defines 'frozenbitarray' with immutability features, includes a simple size calculation, and a test runner. No network, file, or data exfiltration activities are present. The class overrides mutating methods to raise TypeError, ensuring immutability. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a bit array class with an immutable subclass and utility functions. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code within this module. It is safe based on the provided snippet.",
