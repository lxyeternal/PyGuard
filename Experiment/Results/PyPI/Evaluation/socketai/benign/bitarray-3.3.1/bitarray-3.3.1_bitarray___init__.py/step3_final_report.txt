{
  "purpose": "Defines a 'frozenbitarray' class that creates immutable, hashable bit array objects, along with utility functions for bit manipulation and testing.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources; class methods and functions operate on internal data; no user input or network activity.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; the code does not process external inputs or output sensitive data.",
  "flows": "The class methods and functions operate on internal data structures; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard immutable subclass of a bit array with appropriate method overrides to enforce immutability. Utility functions are simple and correct. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious code is present. The code structure is typical for such data structures, with no signs of obfuscation or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of a bit array class with utility functions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
