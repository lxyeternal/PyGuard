    "urandom() reads from os.urandom and outputs a bitarray of random bits.",
    "pprint() reads a bitarray and prints formatted output to sys.stdout or other streams.",
    "strip() and intervals() read from input bitarrays to compute intervals or strip bits.",

  "anomalies": [
    "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets.",
    "No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hidden network connections.",
    "No unusual code constructs or unclear logic.",
    "Use of os.urandom for randomness, which is standard and safe."

  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for bit manipulation, random bit generation, pretty-printing, and Huffman coding. The urandom() function securely generates random bits using os.urandom, which is a secure source of randomness. The pprint() function formats and outputs bitarrays or other objects without any malicious behavior. The strip() and intervals() functions analyze bitarrays for intervals and trimming, with straightforward logic. The ba2int() and int2ba() functions convert between integers and bitarrays, with no insecure or malicious behavior. The Huffman coding functions construct trees and generate codes based on frequency maps without any suspicious activity. Overall, there are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attacks within this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for bitarray operations, randomness, and Huffman coding, implemented securely and without malicious intent. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
