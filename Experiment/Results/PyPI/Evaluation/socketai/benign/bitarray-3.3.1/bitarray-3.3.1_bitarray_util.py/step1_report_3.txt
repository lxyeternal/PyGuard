  "flows": [
    "urandom() uses os.urandom() to generate random bits",
    "ba2int() and int2ba() convert between bitarrays and integers via byte conversions",
    "huffman_code() and canonical_huffman() traverse Huffman trees to produce code mappings",
    "pprint() outputs formatted representations to stream"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of os.urandom() for random bits—this is standard cryptographically secure randomness, not suspicious",
    "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors present",
    "No network connections, data exfiltration, or system modification code",
    "No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code performs utility functions related to bitarray operations, including secure randomness generation, formatting, and Huffman coding. The urandom() function uses os.urandom() appropriately for cryptographic randomness. The conversion functions (ba2int and int2ba) perform standard byte-based conversions respecting endianness and signedness, with no indication of malicious behavior. Huffman coding functions construct trees and codes in an expected manner, with no network activity, data leaks, or suspicious side effects. The pprint() function only formats output for debugging or visualization. Overall, the code is consistent with typical utility libraries and contains no suspicious, backdoor, or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign utility library for bitarray operations, randomness, and Huffman coding. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The use of os.urandom() for secure randomness is appropriate and does not indicate compromise. The code structure and logic are standard for such utilities.",
