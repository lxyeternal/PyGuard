  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior, reading static files, performing environment checks, and configuring package installation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code, no obfuscation, no external data sinks. The version extraction is straightforward, and test routines are typical.\n- **Verdict:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard setup routines, version extraction, and environment checks. Mentions the test import and execution but considers it normal.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to test code, but still minimal)\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, obfuscation, or external communication. The test code is standard and safe.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. Slightly elevated risk score due to test code, but nothing malicious.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical setup script with no signs of malicious activity. Focuses on package configuration, version extraction, and environment checks.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal)\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors or obfuscation. The only dynamic aspect is reading files, which is standard.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Standard package setup, environment checks, reading files, no external effects or malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n- **Analysis:** Completely straightforward, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Fully consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, typical setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n- **Analysis:** No obfuscation, no external network activity, no suspicious logic.\n- **Verdict:** Fully consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious behavior:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 across all reports; the code is standard and safe.\n- **Risk scores:** Almost all are 0.0 or 0.1, which are appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The malware scores are justified as 0.0 since no malicious activity is evident.\n- The security risk scores are also appropriate; the only slight concern is the test code, but it is standard and safe.\n- No changes needed to scores or reasoning.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 or 0.1 (minimal, related to test routines, not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, benign setup script with no security concerns.",
