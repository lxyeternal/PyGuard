{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'bitarray' Python package, used for building and installing the package, including compiling C extensions.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long description, reading 'bitarray/bitarray.h' for version info, detecting Python implementation, and importing modules (re, sys, platform, setuptools/distutils).",
  "sinks": "None identified. No data is sent over network, written to system, or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input from files ('README.rst', 'bitarray/bitarray.h') flows into variables for package configuration. No untrusted external input is processed in a way that could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code is standard for a setup script. No dynamic execution or obfuscation. The only conditional logic is for environment compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment checks (Python version, implementation), reads package metadata from local files, and sets up build parameters. It handles missing files gracefully. No external network calls, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious data handling. The purpose is clear and standard for Python package setup. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a legitimate setup script for the 'bitarray' package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
