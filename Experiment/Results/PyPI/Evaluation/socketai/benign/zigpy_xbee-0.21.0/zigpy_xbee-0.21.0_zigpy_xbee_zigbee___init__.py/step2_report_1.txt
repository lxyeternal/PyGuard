  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports confirm that the code snippet is purely a comment or docstring with no executable code, functions, classes, or logic.\n   - No data sources, sinks, or flows are present, indicating the code is likely a placeholder or documentation stub.\n\n2. **Malicious Indicators & Anomalies**:\n   - No suspicious functions, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected.\n   - The minimal nature of the code makes malicious activity unlikely or impossible to infer without additional context.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious content.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the lack of executable code or vulnerabilities.\n   - Confidence levels vary but are generally high (mostly 0.8 to 1.0), reflecting the certainty that the snippet is benign and minimal.\n\n4. **Potential Issues & Clarifications**:\n   - The only minor concern could be that such minimal code might be a placeholder or incomplete. However, based on the evidence, there’s no indication of malicious intent.\n   - The reports do not claim or imply any obfuscation or suspicious activity, which is appropriate given the content.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risks identified.\n\n**Justification**:\nGiven the entire code snippet is just a comment, there is no way for it to be malicious or pose security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My Overall Estimate**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the logical conclusion that the code is benign and purely descriptive.",
