  "purpose": "Setup stub for legacy builds",
  "sources": "The code imports the setuptools module and calls setuptools.setup() when executed as the main module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive functions; the code simply invokes setup().",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, containing only a standard setup invocation without any additional logic or data handling. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "This script is a basic setup stub intended for legacy build processes. It imports the setuptools module and invokes the setup() function without any parameters or custom logic. There are no inputs, outputs, or data manipulations. It is a common pattern in Python packaging, especially for legacy compatibility. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply facilitates package installation or distribution for legacy builds.",
