  "purpose": "Setup stub for legacy builds, used to facilitate package installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; relies on standard setup invocation.",
  "sinks": "No potential data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple setup invocation.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no unusual patterns or hardcoded secrets; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script using setuptools. It defines a main guard that calls setuptools.setup() without any arguments, which is typical for legacy setup scripts. No data inputs, no malicious behaviors, and no suspicious code structures are present. The code does not attempt to read untrusted input, connect to external services, or execute any dynamic code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward, benign setup stub for legacy builds with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
