{
  "purpose": "Setup stub for legacy builds",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name '__main__' to determine if it's executed as the main program.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'setuptools.setup()' which could process package metadata or install instructions.",
  "flows": "The script checks if '__name__' equals '__main__' and then executes 'setuptools.setup()'.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and typical for a setup script; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and runs its 'setup()' function when executed directly. It is a standard setup stub with no parameters or additional logic, indicating it's intended for legacy build purposes. There are no signs of malicious activity, no data leakage, no hardcoded credentials, and no obfuscated code. The code is simple and straightforward, with no external input processing or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup stub for legacy builds with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
