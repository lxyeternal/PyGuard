  "flows": "Import statement -> main guard -> setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and straightforward with no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and invokes the setup() function when executed as the main module. There are no parameters passed to setup(), indicating a default setup process. The code appears to be a standard setup stub for legacy builds, with no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. No input sources or untrusted data flows are present. The simplicity and context suggest it is an ordinary build script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a basic setup stub with no malicious intent or security concerns. It performs standard setup initialization without any suspicious behavior.",
