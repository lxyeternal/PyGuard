  "purpose": "Define version information for the zigpy_xbee package",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are used",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only assigns constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward version variable assignments",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares version components as constants and formats them into version strings. There are no data reads, external inputs, or security-sensitive operations. The PATCH_VERSION is a string, which could be considered slightly inconsistent but not malicious. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code serves a typical purpose of version management for a package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It does not perform any suspicious or harmful actions.",
