  "purpose": "Initialize version information for the zigpy_xbee package",

  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output identified",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow involving untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward variable assignments and string formatting",
  "analysis": "The code defines version components as constants and constructs version strings using f-strings. There are no dynamic or user-controlled inputs, no external data sources, and no code execution, network activity, or secret handling. The code functions solely to set version metadata, which is standard practice for package initialization. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version information initializer with no malicious or security concerns.",
