  "purpose": "Initialize version information for the zigpy_xbee package",
  "sources": "Constant assignments and string formatting for version variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; version strings are derived from constants",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines version numbers using constant values and string formatting. No input reading, data processing, or external data handling occurs. There are no suspicious functions, dynamic execution, or obfuscated segments. The variables are straightforwardly assigned, indicating standard package metadata setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a basic version info initializer with no signs of malicious behavior, no data leaks, or security issues. It appears safe and standard.",
