  "purpose": "Define static version information for the package using constants and string formatting.",
  "sources": "No external sources; static variable assignments within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Static variable assignments and string concatenation for version strings.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward with no unusual constructs or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static initializer setting version components as constants and constructing version strings via f-strings. It involves no dynamic input, external data, code execution, or network activity. The PATCH_VERSION being a string is standard in versioning and does not introduce security issues. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent. No flaws or assumptions are present that warrant concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration with no security or malicious concerns. All reports are accurate and appropriate in their assessments. No changes are necessary.",
