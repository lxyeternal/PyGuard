  "purpose": "Define version information for the zigpy_xbee package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version components (__short_version__ and __version__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Construction of version strings from constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines version variables for the package using static constants. There are no inputs, no data flows from untrusted sources, no dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behaviors. The PATCH_VERSION is a string, but it is statically assigned and does not pose a security risk. Overall, the code is straightforward and does not contain any malicious or security-sensitive elements.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely sets version information with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard initialization file with static data assignment.",
