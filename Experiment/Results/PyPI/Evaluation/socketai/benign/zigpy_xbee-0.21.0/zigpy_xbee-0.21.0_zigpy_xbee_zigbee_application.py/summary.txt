  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for managing XBee devices within a Zigbee network. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score of approximately 0.2 is justified given the functions involved. The code is safe for deployment under normal conditions."
