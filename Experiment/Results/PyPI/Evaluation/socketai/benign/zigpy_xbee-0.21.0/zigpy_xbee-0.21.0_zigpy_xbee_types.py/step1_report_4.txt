{
  "purpose": "Define data types, enums, and constants for Zigbee and related protocol parsing and serialization.",
  "sources": "Constants, class methods, and enum values that process or return data, including deserialization and serialization methods.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data input handling or external data transmission present in this code segment.",
  "flows": "Data serialization/deserialization flows within class methods; no external or untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code consists of data type definitions, constants, and enum handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes and enums for protocol message handling, with methods for serialization/deserialization and enum defaulting. No external input or network operations are present. The code appears to be standard for protocol data modeling and type safety, with no indications of malicious intent. It contains logical enum handling, including fallback values for undefined inputs, which is typical for robust protocol parsing. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors, are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign, well-structured set of data types and enums for protocol processing. No malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks are evident within this fragment.",
