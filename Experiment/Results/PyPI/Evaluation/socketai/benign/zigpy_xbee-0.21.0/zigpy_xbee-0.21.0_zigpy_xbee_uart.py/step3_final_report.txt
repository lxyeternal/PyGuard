  "malware": 0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "purpose": "Implements UART communication with framing, escaping, checksum validation, and connection management for a Zigbee device.",
  "sources": "Serial port data input, configuration parameters for baud rate and device path",
  "sinks": "Transport write method, data received callback, API handler calls",
  "flows": "Data read from serial port -> framing and escaping functions -> checksum validation -> API frame handling",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard UART protocol handling",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard UART framing, escaping, checksum validation, and connection management. No malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation are justified; the low security risk score of 0.2 reflects minimal potential for misuse but no active vulnerabilities. The logic is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate UART protocol implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
