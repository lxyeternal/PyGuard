  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the claims with the code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only defines exception classes inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - No dynamic code, input/output handling, network operations, or obfuscation.\n   - No signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n   - The code appears to be a straightforward, standard exception hierarchy for handling specific AT command errors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and standard.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are identified or claimed.\n   - The analysis in each report is consistent and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No need for score adjustments.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All reports give `securityRisk: 0`, which is justified.\n   - No suspicious or malicious behavior is present, so higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - The conclusion that the code is safe is justified.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a simple, standard set of custom exception classes.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores given are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is benign, standard, and safe. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
