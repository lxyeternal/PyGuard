  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific XBee AT command errors.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, output, or data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and follows standard Python class definition patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for handling various AT command errors related to XBee modules. It uses simple class inheritance without any dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The classes are lightweight and only serve to categorize exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exceptions for XBee AT command error handling. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected. It is a normal, safe module defining exception classes.",
