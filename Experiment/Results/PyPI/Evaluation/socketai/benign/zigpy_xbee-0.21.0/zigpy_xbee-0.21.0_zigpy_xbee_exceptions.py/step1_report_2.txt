  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific XBee AT command errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; code defines exception classes only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no processing or output of untrusted data occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing; only class definitions with inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated features.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception classes for handling specific error cases related to XBee AT commands. These classes inherit from a base exception class, providing structured error handling. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious logic or behavior. The structure and content align with standard Python practices for exception definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard and benign, intended for error handling in an XBee communication context. No malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks are present.",
