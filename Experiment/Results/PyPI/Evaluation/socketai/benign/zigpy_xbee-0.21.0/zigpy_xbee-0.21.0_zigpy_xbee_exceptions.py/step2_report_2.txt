  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, external data handling, or any malicious activity. The code is straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is just defining exception classes with no security risks. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is benign, no justification exists for higher scores. The current scores are reasonable.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as simple exception class definitions.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent across all reports and appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Estimated Scores (my judgment):**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe set of exception class definitions for handling specific AT command errors in an XBee context. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk present.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
