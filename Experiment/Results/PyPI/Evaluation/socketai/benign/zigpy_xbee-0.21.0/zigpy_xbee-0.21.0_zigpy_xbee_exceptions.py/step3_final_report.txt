  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific AT command errors related to XBee modules.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception, no external data input or output, no network activity.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely class definitions for error handling.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow, no input/output, no execution flow beyond class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class hierarchy with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for specific AT command errors. It does not perform any dynamic operations, data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is simple, clear, and follows standard Python practices. All available reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious patterns or security risks. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as there is no malicious activity. The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions. The security risk score is 0, reflecting the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The confidence in these conclusions is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for XBee AT command error handling. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
