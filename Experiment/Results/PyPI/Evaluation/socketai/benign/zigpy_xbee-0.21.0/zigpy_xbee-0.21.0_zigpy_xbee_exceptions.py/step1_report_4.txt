  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to AT commands in XBee communication.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their inheritance from built-in Exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output handling present; the code does not process external data or inputs.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code consists solely of class declarations without data flows or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of custom exception classes for managing errors associated with XBee AT commands. Each class inherits from a base exception and is used for specific error conditions. The structure is straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions. There are no dynamic code executions, input processing, or external interactions. The code appears to be part of a larger application, serving as error handling definitions only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as exception definitions for a larger application context.",
