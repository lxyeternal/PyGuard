  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code solely defines custom exception classes for handling specific AT command errors related to XBee modules.\n   - There are no indications of dynamic behavior, input handling, network operations, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign and purely for error categorization.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n   - The security risk scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0 for malware and security risk, and the code is only defining exception classes, no higher risk scores are justified.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is accurate.\n   - No malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No overreach or speculative claims are present.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.**",
