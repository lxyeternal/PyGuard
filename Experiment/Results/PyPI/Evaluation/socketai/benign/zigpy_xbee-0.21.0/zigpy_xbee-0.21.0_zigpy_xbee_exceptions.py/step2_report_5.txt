  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code solely defines custom exception classes related to XBee AT command errors.\n- No external data, input handling, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code is present.\n- The class hierarchy is straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The security risk score is also 0, which is appropriate given the context.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the description: simple class definitions inheriting from a base exception.\n- No logic, data flow, or external interactions are present.\n- The purpose is clear: structured error handling.\n\n**Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n- No issues detected; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are justified.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; the analysis correctly states that there's no malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious behavior is present.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is straightforward.\n- The risk score of 0 is correct, as there are no security risks in defining exception classes.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed in scores or conclusions.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical, harmless set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The reports are thorough and correct.",
