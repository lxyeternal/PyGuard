  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific AT command errors related to XBee communication.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code solely defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; code only declares exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow; no source-to-sink pathways present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward class definitions with docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from a base exception. There are no dynamic or suspicious operations, no input handling, no network connections, nor any encoded or obfuscated code. The class hierarchy is simple and standard. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be a part of a larger module for handling XBee AT command errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely defining custom exceptions for specific error conditions related to AT commands. There is no malicious activity, suspicious behavior, or security risk present.",
