  "purpose": "Define configuration schemas for XBee module setup using zigpy configuration framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements (voluptuous, zigpy.config); use of configuration constants and schemas.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; code does not process untrusted input or perform data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; schemas are for validation and configuration setup only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns; code primarily defines data schemas.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, extends existing schemas with optional parameters, and defines a configuration schema for a device. No input reading beyond module import; no data processing, network communication, or data leaks are present. The schemas are intended for configuration validation and do not perform any execution logic that could be malicious. No obfuscated code, suspicious functions, or external calls are found.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration schema definition for an XBee module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a configuration validation purpose without executing untrusted code or data.",
