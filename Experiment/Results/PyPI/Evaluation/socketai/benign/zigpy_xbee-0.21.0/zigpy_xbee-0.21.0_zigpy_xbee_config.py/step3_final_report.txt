  "purpose": "Define configuration schemas for the XBee module setup using zigpy framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from voluptuous and zigpy.config modules; schema extension with optional baudrate parameter.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, processing, or network communication; static schema definitions only.",
  "flows": "Schema extension does not involve data flow or runtime data handling; purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, extends existing schemas with an optional baudrate parameter, and defines validation schemas for device configuration. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is straightforward and purely declarative, serving as a configuration schema.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward schema extension for device configuration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe and standard implementation.",
