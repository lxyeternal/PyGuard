  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for BrowserStack Local errors.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data outputs, network operations, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "Superfluous use of 'super(Exception, self).__init__(message)' instead of 'super().__init__(message)'. No malicious behavior, but the inheritance call is unconventional.",
  "analysis": "The code introduces a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with an initializer passing a message to the superclass. The inheritance call is slightly misused but not malicious. No data input/output, network activity, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign class definition for a custom exception with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
