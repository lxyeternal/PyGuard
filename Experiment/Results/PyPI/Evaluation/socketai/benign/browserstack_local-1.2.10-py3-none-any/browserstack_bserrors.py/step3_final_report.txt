{
  "purpose": "To evaluate the security implications of a simple custom exception class in Python, focusing on potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "sources": "The class definition and constructor, specifically the use of super() in the __init__ method.",
  "sinks": "No external data inputs, outputs, network activity, or data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from class declaration to constructor invocation, with no external or untrusted data sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Incorrect use of super() in the constructor: 'super(Exception, self).__init__(message)' instead of 'super().__init__(message)'.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class with a constructor that misuses super(), which could cause runtime errors but does not indicate malicious intent. No data leaks, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The anomaly is a coding mistake, not malicious behavior. The reports correctly identify this issue and assign a malware score of 0, with low security risk (~0.1). The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions support a benign assessment. The main concern is correcting the super() call to prevent runtime errors, but this does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class definition with a minor implementation error. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting a simple bug rather than a security vulnerability.",
