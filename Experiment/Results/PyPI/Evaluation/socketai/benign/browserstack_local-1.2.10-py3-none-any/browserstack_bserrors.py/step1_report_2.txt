{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for BrowserStack Local errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows, input, or output pathways are implemented.",
  "anomalies": "The constructor calls super with super(Exception, self) instead of super().__init__, which is unconventional but not malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a subclass of Exception to represent specific errors related to BrowserStack Local. The constructor initializes the superclass with a message. The use of super(Exception, self) is unusual; normally, super().__init__(message) would be used. No external data handling, input/output, or potentially malicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard custom exception class with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
