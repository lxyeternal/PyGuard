{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for BrowserStack local errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; class only defines an exception type.",
  "anomalies": "The use of super(Exception, self).__init__(message) is unusual; typically, it should be super().__init__(message). This may indicate a potential mistake or obfuscation, but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception named BrowserStackLocalError with a constructor that calls the superclass constructor. The inheritance and constructor call are straightforward. The unusual use of super(Exception, self).__init__(message) could be a mistake but does not suggest malicious behavior. No external data, no insecure practices, and no obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple exception class definition with a minor unconventional use of super(). It poses no security threat or malicious behavior. The unusual super() call is likely a coding mistake rather than malicious intent.",
