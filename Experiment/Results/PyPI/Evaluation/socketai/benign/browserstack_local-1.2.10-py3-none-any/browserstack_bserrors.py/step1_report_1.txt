  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for BrowserStack local errors",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "The __init__ method calls super with incorrect arguments; it should call super().__init__(message) instead of super(Exception, self).__init__(message), which indicates a coding error but not malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to define a custom exception class BrowserStackLocalError inheriting from Exception. The __init__ method is intended to initialize the exception with a message. However, it incorrectly calls super(Exception, self).__init__(message), which is a misuse of the super() function. This could lead to runtime errors. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation. The misimplementation appears to be an error rather than malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, albeit incorrectly implemented, custom exception class with no malicious intent. The primary concern is a coding mistake rather than malicious activity or security risk.",
