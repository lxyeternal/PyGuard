  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for BrowserStack local errors.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The class is a straightforward custom exception without unusual code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class that inherits from Python's Exception class. The __init__ method calls super with the incorrect class (super(Exception, self)) which is a common mistake but not malicious. There is no data input, external data handling, or suspicious behavior. The code is simple and standard for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks. The incorrect use of super() appears to be an implementation mistake but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
