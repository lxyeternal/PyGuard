      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing a binary download and verification process. It contains no malicious activity or obfuscation. The main concern is the recursive retry pattern, which could be optimized for robustness but does not constitute a security threat. The overall security risk score is low (~0.2), with malware and obfuscation scores at zero."

      "conclusion": "The assessments and scores across all reports are appropriate and consistent with the provided descriptions. No evidence of malware or significant security risks is found. Slight obfuscation suspicion in report 2 is justified but does not elevate malware or risk scores. Overall, the evaluations are cautious yet reasonable, accurately reflecting the limited or benign nature of the code."

      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward process management utility for the BrowserStack local binary, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The security risk is low and primarily related to external process execution, which is typical for such utilities. The scores assigned across the reports are consistent and justified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign class definition with a minor implementation error. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting a simple bug rather than a security vulnerability."
