  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a web server and handle incoming requests, possibly for serving content or APIs.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, HTTP request parameters, and potentially user-provided data via web requests.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to network sockets, files, or external services, and possibly echoed back to clients.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or request parameters flows into processing functions, then possibly into output responses or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious backdoors detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed. The code structure seems typical for a web server.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a web server using common Python libraries, processes requests, and responds accordingly. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious external connections, and no signs of malicious intent are evident. Usage of standard libraries and typical request handling suggests a benign purpose. Absence of code injection, unsafe SQL, or data exfiltration mechanisms. No signs of malware activities such as system compromise or unauthorized data access.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard web server implementation with no malicious intent.",
