  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from code snippets, data processing functions, web server code, or absence of code.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network communications, environment variable access, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, data processing) to sinks (network, environment), or no flow if code is absent.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic execution patterns, or absence of code, which may hinder analysis.",
  "analysis": "All reports without code correctly abstain from assigning malicious or high risk scores. Reports with code describe benign behavior, with no evidence of malicious activity. Slight obfuscation suspicion (score 0.2) in report 2 is reasonable given minor obfuscation hints but no malicious indicators. Scores for malware are consistently low or zero, matching the analysis. Risk scores are low, reflecting minimal threat. The reasoning in each report aligns with the scores, and no unjustified high scores are present.",
  "conclusion": "The assessments and scores across all reports are appropriate and consistent with the provided descriptions. No evidence of malware or significant security risks is found. Slight obfuscation suspicion in report 2 is justified but does not elevate malware or risk scores. Overall, the evaluations are cautious yet reasonable, accurately reflecting the limited or benign nature of the code.",
