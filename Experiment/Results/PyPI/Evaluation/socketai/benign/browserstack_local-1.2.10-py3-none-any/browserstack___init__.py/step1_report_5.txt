  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided or visible; the code appears to be an empty or placeholder script with no clear functionality.",
  "sources": "No input sources are evident in the code; no external data, user input, or environment variables are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data output, network calls, file operations, or sensitive actions are observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present, as the code contains no operations or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is entirely empty, with no functions, variables, or logic; there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious constructs, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is an empty script with no content, making it impossible to identify any source, sink, or flow. Its lack of logic or data handling indicates it does not perform any operations, malicious or otherwise. Without further code or context, there are no suspicious elements or security concerns present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is empty and contains no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. Consequently, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The absence of code makes it impossible to perform a detailed security assessment or identify malicious intent.",
