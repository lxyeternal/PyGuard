  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward process management utility for the BrowserStack local binary, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The security risk is low and primarily related to external process execution, which is typical for such utilities. The scores assigned across the reports are consistent and justified."
