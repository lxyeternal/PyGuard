  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for managing a binary download and verification process. It contains no malicious activity or obfuscation. The main concern is the recursive retry pattern, which could be optimized for robustness but does not constitute a security threat. The overall security risk score is low (~0.2), with malware and obfuscation scores at zero."
