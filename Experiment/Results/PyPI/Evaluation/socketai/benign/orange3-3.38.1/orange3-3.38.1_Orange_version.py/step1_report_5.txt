  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated from setup.py, and manages release state.",
  "sources": "Reads the variable 'release' and assigns version strings; no external data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data processed or output.",
  "flows": "Conditional modification of 'version' and 'short_version' based on the 'release' flag.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present; straightforward variable assignments and conditional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code simply sets version-related variables based on whether it's a release build or a development build. No external input, no suspicious code, no environment variables, no I/O operations, and no malicious logic detected. It is standard versioning code generated from setup.py with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign, standard version info setup code with no malicious or security concern. It merely manages version strings based on release state.",
