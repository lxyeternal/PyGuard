{
  "purpose": "This code manages version information for a Python package, defining static version strings and conditionally appending a development suffix based on the release status.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments for version strings and the 'release' boolean flag.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static assignments to a conditional that modifies 'short_version' if 'release' is False; no external data or user input influences this flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, static, and auto-generated with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for versioning, with a simple conditional to append '.dev' when not a release. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or secrets involved. The logic is correct and standard for version management in setup scripts. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version management snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
