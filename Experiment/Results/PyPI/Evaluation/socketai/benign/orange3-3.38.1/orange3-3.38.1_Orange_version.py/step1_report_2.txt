  "purpose": "This code defines version-related variables for a Python package, generated from setup.py, for tracking package versions and release status.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments setting version, full_version, git_revision, and release status, based on setup.py generation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow from untrusted input; no external data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive points; the code only sets static variables based on conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of static variable assignments and a simple conditional.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables, including git revision and release status, from a generated setup.py file. The conditional modifies version string if not in release mode. There are no external inputs, user data, or system commands involved. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident. The code's simplicity and static nature indicate it is a standard versioning script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version info assignment script generated from setup.py with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
