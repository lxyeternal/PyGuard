  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as straightforward variable assignments and conditional logic based on a 'release' flag.\n- No external inputs, user data, or environment variables are involved.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated from setup.py, serving solely to manage version strings.\n\n**Malware and obfuscation scores:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity and static nature.\n- I agree with these assessments; there's no indication of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n**Security risk assessment:**\n- Since the code is static, has no external data sources, and performs only benign variable assignments, the security risk is effectively zero.\n- The reports correctly assign securityRisk = 0.\n\n**Scores consistency:**\n- The confidence level is 1 across all reports, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent and sound.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- No issues found. The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- No need to adjust scores or conclusions.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n- Based on the code snippet and reports, I concur that the code is benign and poses no security risk.\n- The scores of malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and securityRisk = 0 are justified.\n- The detailed reasoning in each report is appropriate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
