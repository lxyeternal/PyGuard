{
  "purpose": "This code sets versioning information for a Python package, likely used during setup or build processes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the setup.py file, specifically version and revision info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs; no data leaks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Assigns version variables; conditional logic adjusts version based on release status.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code performs straightforward assignment with no unusual patterns or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables for a package, including a git revision identifier. It conditionally modifies the version string if not a release build. All operations are standard variable assignments with no external input, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard versioning code with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply manages version information for a package build process.",
