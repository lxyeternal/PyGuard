  "purpose": "Define versioning information for the package based on generated data from setup.py",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables and revision information",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to external systems or outputs",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; static assignment only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and consistent with standard version declaration",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version-related variables for a Python package, with a conditional update depending on the release status. All variables are hardcoded or derived from a static git revision. There are no inputs, no dynamic execution, and no external data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious version declaration snippet used during package setup. It contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
