{
  "purpose": "The code implements a set of machine learning classes and wrappers for data preprocessing, model fitting, prediction, and serialization within the Orange framework, supporting various models including scikit-learn, CatBoost, and XGBoost.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input data structures such as Table, Instance, and numpy arrays; parameters are extracted from class attributes and function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Prediction outputs are generated via predict and predict_storage methods; data transformations occur during preprocessing and domain conversions; models are serialized via pickling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input structures through preprocessing steps, into model fitting or prediction functions, then backmapped or returned as predictions or probabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation patterns are present. Use of np.random.RandomState for backmapping is a standard statistical approach, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard ML classes with clear data flow and data handling routines. No network or system modifications are detected. The use of external libraries and wrappers is routine. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The code is well-structured, with proper handling of data transformations, prediction, and serialization. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured machine learning framework component with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It poses negligible supply chain risk.",
