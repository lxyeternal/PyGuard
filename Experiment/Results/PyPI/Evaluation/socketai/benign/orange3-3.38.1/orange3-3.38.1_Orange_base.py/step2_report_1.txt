  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for potential issues, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as ML classes with preprocessing, fitting, and prediction, involving data from data structures and parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes data flows through preprocessing, fitting, backmapping, and prediction.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or malicious behaviors; standard ML patterns, no obfuscation, no network/system interactions.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-founded, high confidence (0.9), malware and obfuscated scores are 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies ML class definitions, data flow, and standard library usage.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate about prediction methods, data transformations, and serialization.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity or suspicious code; uses standard ML workflows, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9), malware score is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes ML classes, data handling, and integration with Orange and other frameworks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly details data flow from input to prediction.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no network/system exploits.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes ML classes, data flow, and use of external libraries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from input through preprocessing, training, to prediction.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity, no backdoors, standard ML code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-reasoned, high confidence (0.95), malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Appropriately describes the code as ML framework with data handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly mentions data flow and external library usage.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, network activity, or sabotage.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score 0).\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation (score 0).\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting standard ML code with minimal security risk (0.1–0.2).\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, typical for ML libraries)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the reports’ assessments. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured ML framework with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type | Estimated Value | Justification |\n|--------------|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware      | 0                | No malicious activity or backdoors observed. |\n| Obfuscated   | 0                | Clear, readable code with no obfuscation patterns. |\n| Risk         | 0.1–0.2          | Typical ML library code, minimal security concerns. |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe supply chain risk from this code is negligible. It is a legitimate ML framework code with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
