{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of classes for machine learning models, learners, and preprocessors within the Orange data mining framework, supporting scikit-learn, CatBoost, and XGBoost models.",
  "sources": "Data inputs come from parameters in methods such as fit(), fit_storage(), and __call__, as well as class attributes like preprocessors and params. Data is read from instances, tables, arrays, and sparse matrices. Environment variables are imported from Orange.misc.environ.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur in model fitting and prediction functions via the usage of untrusted data passed to fit() or predict() methods. There are no direct network operations or system modifications. No insecure code execution or eval statements are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables (X, Y, W) through preprocessors, into models for training, then predictions are generated. Predictions are backmapped or transformed and returned. Data transformations happen via methods like data.transform(). Model parameters are set via params attribute. No external network or file operations are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code uses standard library functions and common ML practices. No obfuscation, hidden code, or unusual behaviors are observed. Use of warnings.warn for deprecation notices is normal. No indication of malicious privacy or system exploits.",
  "analysis": "The code defines ML classes with methods for data preprocessing, model fitting, prediction, and domain transformations. No external network calls, file manipulations, or system modifications are present. All data handling appears standard for machine learning workflows. The use of environment variables, warnings, and data transformations are routine. No malicious or sabotage code, such as code injection, data theft, or reverse shells, is found. The code adheres to typical design patterns for modular ML components.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and standard implementation of machine learning model wrappers and preprocessors within the Orange framework. There are no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. The code’s functions are aligned with common ML practices and do not pose supply chain threats or privacy violations.",
