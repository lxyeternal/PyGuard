{
  "purpose": "Define a subclass of numpy.ndarray for representing and manipulating distance matrices, including file I/O capabilities and metadata handling.",
  "sources": "File reading in from_file and _from_dst methods, reading labels from files, reading data from open files.",
  "sinks": "File writing in save and _save_dst methods, potentially writing distance matrices and labels to files.",
  "flows": "Data read from files (from_file, _from_dst) flows into object initialization; data potentially written out via save or _save_dst.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or suspicious variable names. The code handles file I/O with standard Python libraries and numpy, with no indications of malicious intent. Use of deprecated decorators suggests legacy code but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a DistanceMatrix class that extends numpy.ndarray, providing methods for creation, file import/export, and label handling. File reading is handled with standard Python file operations and numpy for parsing distance data, with support for Excel files via an external module. File writing involves saving matrices with optional labels. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code's functions appear to serve legitimate data processing purposes within a data analysis context. No suspicious behavior such as data theft, backdoors, or malicious manipulation was detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility class for managing distance matrices with file I/O and metadata support. No malicious or sabotage behavior is evident, and it appears safe for use in data processing workflows.",
