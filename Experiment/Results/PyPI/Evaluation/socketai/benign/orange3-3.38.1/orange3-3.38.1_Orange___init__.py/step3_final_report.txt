  "flows": "Import of modules -> conditional Qt setup -> ctypes.CDLL call -> import hooks.",
  "anomalies": "Broad except clause around ctypes.CDLL, dynamic import hooks, environment-dependent code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup routines for a Python GUI/data analysis package, including lazy module loading, optional Qt support, and system-specific workarounds. The use of ctypes.CDLL to load libGL.so.1 is a common workaround on Linux systems to prevent graphics driver issues. The broad exception handling around this call could suppress errors, but it is a known pattern and not malicious. Import hooks for Qt are standard for supporting multiple Qt versions. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or malicious code is present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign setup code for a GUI-enabled Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The minor risk score reflects the potential misuse of environment suppression techniques but is justified given the context. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
