  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines a `frozendict` class that disables all mutative methods, creating an immutable dictionary.\n- Implements `natural_sorted`, which sorts strings or other values in a human-friendly order, splitting strings into numeric and non-numeric parts.\n- Defines `DictMissingConst`, a dictionary subclass that returns a fixed value for missing keys, avoiding overhead of default dicts.\n\n**Security considerations:**\n- The code uses standard Python features, no external data sources, network activity, or file I/O.\n- No untrusted data is processed directly within these utilities.\n- The classes and functions are utility in nature, designed for safe data handling.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.\n\n**Review of the reports:**\n- All reports consistently conclude the code is benign, utility-oriented, with no security risks.\n- They assign malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0 or very close to 0.\n- The confidence levels are high (1), indicating thorough review.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 or 0 — very low, as the code is utility and does not pose security threats.\n\n**Potential issues or points to challenge:**\n- The only slight concern might be if these utilities are used with untrusted input elsewhere, but as standalone, they are safe.\n- The `natural_sorted` function uses regex splitting, which is safe here.\n- The `frozendict` enforces immutability, which is a good security practice in some contexts.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign utility code.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the minimal risk if misused, but inherently safe)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code appears safe and well-implemented for its purpose, with no security concerns in its current form.",
