{
  "purpose": "The code defines several utility classes and functions: a frozen dictionary with restricted modification methods, a natural sorting function, and a custom dictionary with a constant for missing keys.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters such as 'values' for sorting, 'missing' for default values, and the internal use of re.split for string processing.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include sorting and dictionary operations that could process untrusted input, but no direct untrusted data handling or output is evident.",
  "flows": "The data flows from input parameters into functions, with sorting or dictionary lookups, but there are no apparent flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code primarily defines classes and functions for safe data handling and sorting.",
  "analysis": "The frozendict class restricts modification methods to enforce immutability, which is safe. The natural_sorted function performs string-based natural sorting by splitting strings into numeric and non-numeric parts, with no execution of untrusted code or data. The DictMissingConst class optimizes dictionary lookups by returning a fixed value for missing keys, avoiding common dictionary overhead; it only implements safe data handling without executing external or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of utility classes and functions aimed at safe data handling and sorting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The implementation appears benign and intended for use as helper utilities.",
