  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Confirm if issues are present in the code:**\n- The code consists of utility classes (`frozendict`, `DictMissingConst`) and a sorting function (`natural_sorted`).\n- No evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The code appears to be standard, safe utility code.\n\n**2. Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no security issues.\n- They correctly note that the classes restrict modifications, perform natural sorting, and handle missing keys efficiently.\n- No flaws or logical errors are evident in their reasoning.\n\n**3. Review the scores assigned:**\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, security risk scores of 0 or very low, and high confidence (1).\n- These scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- No adjustments seem necessary based on the content.\n\n**4. Justify any higher risk scores:**\n- Since the code is purely utility, with no network, I/O, or external data handling, and no malicious behavior, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n- The code does not process untrusted input in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n\n**5. Challenge claims based on assumptions:**\n- The reports assume benign intent based on code structure, which is reasonable.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are necessary or supported.\n\n**6. Consistency of scores:**\n- The scores align well with the analysis: no malware, no security risk, high confidence.\n- The overall assessment is that the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (already low, consistent with utility code)  \n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is standard utility code for data handling and sorting, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive behavior. The uniform high confidence and zero malware scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is benign utility code.\n- No security risks or malware are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the current scores. The code poses no supply chain security risk.",
