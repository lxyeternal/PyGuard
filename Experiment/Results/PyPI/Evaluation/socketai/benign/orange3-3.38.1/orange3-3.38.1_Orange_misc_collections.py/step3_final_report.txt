{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for immutable dictionaries, natural sorting, and optimized handling of missing keys in dictionaries.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to files, network, or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely utility functions and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard implementations and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a frozen dictionary class that disables mutative methods, a natural sorting function that splits strings into numeric and non-numeric parts for human-friendly sorting, and a dictionary subclass that returns a fixed value for missing keys to optimize performance. There are no external data inputs, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. The code is static, well-structured, and uses standard Python features. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no malicious intent or security risks. It is well-implemented, straightforward, and safe for supply chain use. The existing assessments of malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are appropriate.",
