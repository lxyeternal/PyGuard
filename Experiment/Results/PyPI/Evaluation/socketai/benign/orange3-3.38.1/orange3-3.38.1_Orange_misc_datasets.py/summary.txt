  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or behavior. The only minor security consideration is the integrity of the external JSON file, which is a common risk for configuration files but not a flaw in the code itself. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
