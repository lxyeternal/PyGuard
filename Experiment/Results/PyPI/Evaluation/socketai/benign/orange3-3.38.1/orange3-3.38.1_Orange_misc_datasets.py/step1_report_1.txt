  "purpose": "Load dataset information from a JSON file and store it in a dictionary-like object.",
  "sources": "Reading from a file at '../datasets/datasets.info' relative to the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or outputs; only file reading and data loading occur.",
  "flows": "File path construction -> File opening -> JSON data loading -> Data updating in object.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that inherits from dict, which initializes by constructing a path to a 'datasets.info' JSON file located in a relative directory. It reads this JSON file and updates the instance with the data. The use of __file__ ensures the path is relative to the script's location. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and uses standard Python practices for data loading.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, legitimate task of loading configuration or dataset info from a file without any suspicious or malicious activity. It appears to be a normal component of a data processing or configuration system.",
