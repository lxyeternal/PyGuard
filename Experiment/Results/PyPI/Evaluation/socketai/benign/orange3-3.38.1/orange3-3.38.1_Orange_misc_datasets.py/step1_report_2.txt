{
  "purpose": "Load dataset information from a JSON file and store it in a custom dictionary object.",
  "sources": "Reading 'datasets.info' JSON file from a relative datasets directory based on the script's location.",
  "sinks": "None directly, but the code reads external data which could be manipulated if the file is tampered with.",
  "flows": "Reading the JSON file from the datasets folder and updating the object with the loaded data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code dynamically constructs a file path based on the current script's location, which is standard practice. No obfuscated or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class _DatasetInfo that extends dict. On initialization, it constructs a path to a datasets directory relative to the script's location. It then reads a JSON file named 'datasets.info' from that directory and loads its contents into the dictionary. The code uses standard modules (json and os) for file handling and path operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to be straightforward data loading logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data loader that reads a JSON file into a custom dictionary object. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a typical configuration or data loading component.",
