  "purpose": "Load JSON data from a local 'datasets.info' file into a dictionary subclass, enabling attribute access.",
  "sources": "Reading 'datasets.info' file located at '../datasets' relative to the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; data is loaded into memory without external transmission or code execution.",
  "flows": "File path constructed using __file__, JSON loaded, data stored in dict and __dict__.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard data loading pattern, no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from dict, which on initialization constructs a path to a JSON file relative to the script's location, loads the JSON data, and updates its own dictionary and attribute dictionary. It uses standard modules (json, os) with no network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is reliance on an external file that could be tampered with, but this is typical for configuration data. No code injection, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, readable, and standard for configuration loading.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or behavior. The only minor security consideration is the integrity of the external JSON file, which is a common risk for configuration files but not a flaw in the code itself. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
