{
  "purpose": "This code reads and writes matrix data from and to Excel files using openpyxl and numpy, primarily for data processing or analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from Excel files via openpyxl.load_workbook, specifically from specified sheets or the active sheet.",
  "sinks": "Data may be written to Excel files via openpyxl's cell assignment, but no direct data leaks or untrusted data effects are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input data from Excel sheets (sources) flows through functions that parse and convert cell data into numpy arrays, then potentially back to Excel (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are evident. The code performs standard data parsing and file I/O operations. Exception handling appears normal. No obfuscated or unusual language features are used.",
  "analysis": "The code safely loads Excel sheets and processes cell data, converting it to numpy arrays. It handles empty sheets and non-numeric data by raising exceptions, which is appropriate. No malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system disruption is present. Third-party libraries (openpyxl, numpy) are used as intended. No hidden or malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data processing module for reading and writing matrices in Excel files. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code. It performs typical file I/O and data conversion tasks securely.",
