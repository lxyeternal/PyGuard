{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to read, process, and write matrices from and to Excel sheets, primarily for data analysis or manipulation tasks involving numerical data in spreadsheets.",
  "sources": "Data is read from Excel files using openpyxl.load_workbook() and sheet rows and cells are accessed via sheet.rows, cell.value, and other openpyxl methods.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to new Excel files via openpyxl.Workbook() and sheet.cell().value assignments; no untrusted data is sent over network or external channels.",
  "flows": "Input data from Excel files flows into numpy arrays after processing; processed data can be saved back into Excel files. No external network or system calls involving untrusted data are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual constructs, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names are observed. No dynamic execution or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles reading Excel sheets into numpy arrays, performing data validation, and writing matrices back to Excel files. Functions include safe data parsing, label extraction, and matrix creation, all using standard libraries and safe practices. Error handling appears appropriate for invalid sheets, missing data, or invalid cell contents. No indications of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or covert operations are found. The code does not connect to external networks, execute system commands, or handle sensitive information beyond file I/O.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard utility for Excel-based matrix processing with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs data validation and transformation safely, without suspicious network activity or backdoors. Overall, it is a benign and straightforward implementation.",
