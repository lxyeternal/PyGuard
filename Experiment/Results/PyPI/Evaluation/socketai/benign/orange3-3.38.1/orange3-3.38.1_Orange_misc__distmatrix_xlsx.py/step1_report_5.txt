{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to read and write matrices from Excel files using openpyxl, including extracting data from sheets and handling labels and empty cells.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from Excel files via openpyxl.load_workbook and sheet.rows, and accesses cell values within the sheet.",
  "sinks": "The code writes matrices back to Excel files through openpyxl.Workbook and sheet.cell, and raises errors for invalid data.",
  "flows": "Input data is read from Excel sheets (sources), processed into numpy arrays, and potentially written back to files (sinks); data flows through reading, processing, and writing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code uses standard libraries for Excel and array handling. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code detected. Exception handling is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles reading Excel data into numpy arrays and writing numpy matrices back to Excel files. It performs data validation, conversion, and label extraction. The functions are standard, with no indications of malicious intent. No external network communications, reverse shells, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The only potential concern might be in data validation or error handling, but these are typical for data processing scripts. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate data processing utility for Excel matrices. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It performs standard operations using openpyxl and numpy with appropriate error handling.",
