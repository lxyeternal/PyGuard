{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to read and write matrices from Excel sheets, validating data and handling labels, with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reading cell values from Excel sheets via openpyxl, particularly in _non_empty_cells and _matrix_from_cells functions.",
  "sinks": "Data processing within numpy arrays; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from Excel cell values through validation and conversion in _matrix_from_cells to numpy matrices, then potentially written back to Excel.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard Excel data parsing, validation, and matrix creation. It uses openpyxl for reading and writing Excel files, with proper validation and exception handling. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code's operations are straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for Excel matrix handling. It poses minimal security risk and contains no malware or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
