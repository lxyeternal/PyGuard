{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions and classes for warning management, resource handling, deprecation, timing, data conversions, and other internal support functionalities. It includes mechanisms for logging warnings, loading resources, marking functions as deprecated, and various helper utilities.",
  "sources": "Warning override functions, resource file access via importlib.resources, environment variables for warning filters, dynamic entry point loading with importlib.metadata, function decorators, and data parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "Warning messages are intercepted and logged; resource files are loaded from package data; dynamic entry points are loaded from distribution metadata; no external network or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Warnings are captured and logged via override of '_showwarnmsg_impl'; resource filenames are retrieved through resource functions; entry points are loaded via 'get_entry_point'; deprecation warnings are issued during function calls; data parsing functions convert literals and evaluate expressions.",
  "anomalies": "The override of '_showwarnmsg_impl' to redirect warnings to a custom logger is unconventional but used here solely for warning logging, not malicious activity. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions with clear, well-structured logic. The warning override is a known pattern for centralized warning logging, not malicious. Resource loading and dynamic entry point functions are standard practices. No external data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior is detected. The code's design emphasizes internal support and logging, with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module intended for internal framework support. It does not contain any malicious code, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1—are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
