  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard setup script; reads environment, filesystem, subprocess (git revision), package files.\n- **Sinks:** Subprocess calls for git, sphinx, coverage; file writes for version info.\n- **Flow:** Typical data flow for build/versioning.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; subprocesses are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The script performs expected setup tasks; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup tasks; filesystem, environment, subprocess.\n- **Sinks:** Subprocess calls for git, sphinx, coverage; dynamic import for version info.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of subprocess to execute 'git rev-parse' and 'sphinx-build' is standard, but potential if inputs are manipulated.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; subprocesses are controlled and typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — slightly elevated risk score, justified by subprocess execution, but overall low.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. Slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup; reads environment, files, runs subprocesses.\n- **Sinks:** Subprocess for git, sphinx; version file writes.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns; subprocesses are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; typical setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; package setup, versioning, documentation.\n- **Sinks:** subprocess calls, file I/O, translation function.\n- **Anomalies:** The translation function's behavior isn't detailed, but assuming standard localization, no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent; subprocesses are controlled.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Complex setup; dependencies, extensions, documentation.\n- **Sinks:** subprocess calls for version, sphinx; dynamic compilation.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of subprocess for version info and documentation is standard; no suspicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard build process.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** None of the reports detect obfuscation; all are straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated in some reports (0.2, 0.1) due to subprocess calls, but justified given the context.\n\n**Overall, the code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package. It performs versioning, dependency management, documentation build, and extension compilation in a standard manner. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation are evident.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, due to subprocess usage, but within normal bounds for build scripts.\n\n**Final note:** The code is typical for complex Python package setup and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
