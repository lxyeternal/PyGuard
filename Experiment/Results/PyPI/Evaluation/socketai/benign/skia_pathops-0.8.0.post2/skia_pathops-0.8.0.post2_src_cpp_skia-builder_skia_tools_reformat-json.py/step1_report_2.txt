  "purpose": "Reformatting JSON files to a pretty-printed format for easier diffs in subsequent runs.",
  "sources": "Reads input filenames from command-line arguments and loads JSON data from those files via gm_json.LoadFromFile.",
  "sinks": "Writes reformatted JSON back to the same files using gm_json.WriteToFile.",
  "flows": "Input filenames -> gm_json.LoadFromFile -> gm_json.WriteToFile -> Filesystem output.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamically modifies sys.path to include a relative 'gm' directory; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily orchestrates JSON reformatting using imported functions from gm_json, adding the 'gm' directory to sys.path. No user input beyond filenames, no network activity, or external calls are involved. The code is straightforward and standard for file processing, with no indications of malicious intent. It relies on external gm_json module for core functionality, which appears to be intended for JSON processing only.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign task of JSON reformatting for better diff readability. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The only notable behavior is dynamic modification of sys.path to locate internal modules, which is standard for plugin-like extensions.",
