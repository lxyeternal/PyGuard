  "purpose": "Reformats JSON files to a pretty-printed format for easier diffing, without modifying content.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON data via gm_json.LoadFromFile; no other data sources.",
  "sinks": "Writes reformatted JSON back to the same file via gm_json.WriteToFile.",
  "flows": "Load JSON data from file -> process with gm_json -> write back to file.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamically appends 'gm' directory to sys.path to import gm_json; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The script performs file I/O for JSON reformatting, delegating core logic to external gm_json module. It modifies sys.path to include a local directory, which is standard in plugin systems but could be exploited if environment is compromised. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward, purpose-specific, and lacks suspicious patterns. External gm_json module's security is assumed but not verified. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code detected. The dynamic path modification is a minor concern but common practice; overall, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign JSON reformatter with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1–0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
