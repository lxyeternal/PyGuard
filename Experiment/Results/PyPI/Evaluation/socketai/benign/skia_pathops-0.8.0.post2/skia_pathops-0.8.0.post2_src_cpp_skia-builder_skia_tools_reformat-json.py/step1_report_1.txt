  "purpose": "Reformat JSON files to a standard pretty-print format for easier diffing.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files specified as command-line arguments, and loads them via gm_json.LoadFromFile.",
  "sinks": "Writes reformatted JSON back to the same files using gm_json.WriteToFile.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> gm_json.LoadFromFile -> process data -> gm_json.WriteToFile -> original file overwritten.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamically modifies sys.path to include 'gm' directory; imports gm_json module. No user input handling or environment variables used insecurely. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly performs file I/O and JSON reformatting by leveraging external 'gm_json' module. It appends a directory to sys.path dynamically to import local modules, which is typical in controlled codebases. No data is transmitted externally, and no code executes untrusted input. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present. The code structure is straightforward and purpose-driven.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign task of reformatting JSON files without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain suspicious code, backdoors, or data leaks.",
