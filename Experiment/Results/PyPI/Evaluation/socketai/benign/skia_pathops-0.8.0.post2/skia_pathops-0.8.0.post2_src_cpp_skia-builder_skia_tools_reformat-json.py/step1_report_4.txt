{
  "purpose": "The script reformats a JSON file to a pretty-print format to ensure consistent diffs in subsequent runs of a related script.",
  "sources": "Reads input JSON files specified as command-line arguments; imports gm_json module which reads and writes JSON files.",
  "sinks": "Uses gm_json.LoadFromFile() and gm_json.WriteToFile() which likely read and write JSON data to disk.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> gm_json.LoadFromFile() -> data processed in memory -> gm_json.WriteToFile() -> file overwritten.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a custom gm_json module from a relative path. It appends a directory to sys.path to import gm_json, which handles JSON loading and saving. The Reformat function loads JSON data from a given file and rewrites it in a pretty-printed format. Command-line arguments specify files to process. No user input is directly accepted beyond filenames, and there are no network operations, system modifications, or credential handling. The code appears to serve a straightforward file reformatting purpose, relying on external gm_json functions, which are not provided but assumed to be standard JSON operations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for reformatting JSON files. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected. The script's operations are limited to reading and rewriting JSON files with proper formatting, with no indication of malicious intent.",
