  "purpose": "Reformatting JSON files to a standardized pretty-print format for easier diff analysis.",
  "sources": "User-supplied filenames via command-line arguments; reading and writing JSON files through gm_json module.",
  "sinks": "Writing reformatted JSON data back to original files.",
  "flows": "User input (filenames) -> load JSON -> reformat JSON -> write JSON back to files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The code dynamically adjusts PYTHONPATH to include a specific 'gm' directory, which could be exploited if the directory is maliciously replaced or compromised, but this is standard practice for plugin/module inclusion.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles JSON reformatting, importing a custom gm_json module to load and write JSON files. It adds a relative directory to PYTHONPATH, which is typical for plugin management but could be misused if the directory is maliciously controlled. No external network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are present. The script relies on trusted external modules and standard library functions. The dynamic path addition is routine but could be risky if the directory is compromised. Overall, the code's functionality is benign, focused solely on JSON formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for JSON file reformatting with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It operates solely on user-provided files and uses standard practices for module importation. There are no indicators of malware or security risks within this script.",
