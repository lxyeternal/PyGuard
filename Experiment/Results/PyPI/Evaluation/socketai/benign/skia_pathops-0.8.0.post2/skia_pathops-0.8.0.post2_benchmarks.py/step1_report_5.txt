  "purpose": "The script benchmarks and processes UFO font files by removing overlaps from glyph contours using specified union functions and pen getters, and then outputs timing statistics.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1] for the font filename, sys.argv[2] for optional repeat count, imported modules, and functions like 'remove_overlaps' and 'timeit.repeat'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data flows lead to sensitive actions like network calls, file manipulation, or secret access.",
  "flows": "Input filename from command line -> font loading -> processing functions -> timing output.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code for file deletion and saving fonts; no active malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code paths observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs font processing and benchmarking using established libraries. It reads font filenames from command line arguments, runs timing tests on overlap removal functions, and optionally deletes or saves font files (currently commented out). No suspicious data flows, network activity, or credential handling detected. The code appears benign, focused solely on font processing and performance measurement.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a performance benchmarking tool for font processing functions with no indication of malicious behavior. It does not contain any backdoors, network activity, or harmful actions. All observed code is related to font manipulation and timing measurement, with no malicious intent.",
