  "purpose": "Benchmarking font overlap removal functions by timing their execution on a specified font file.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument for font filename, font object initialization, and glyph contours during processing.",
  "sinks": "Console output of timing results; no external data exfiltration or file writes in active code.",
  "flows": "User provides font filename -> font object is created -> remove_overlaps processes glyphs -> timing measurements are printed.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out code for saving/deleting fonts; no active malicious or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs in-memory font processing and timing, with no network activity, external data handling, or obfuscation. It uses standard font libraries and straightforward logic. The only potential concern is reliance on user input for font filename, which is typical for command-line tools and does not introduce security risks. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are detected. The code's purpose is benign performance benchmarking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate font benchmarking utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. The scores in the reports—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: approximately 0.1—are consistent with the code's benign and straightforward nature.",
