  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Builds Skia, downloads virtualenv.pyz dynamically from a URL.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess for environment setup, build, and packaging; file writes for virtualenv.pyz.\n- **Anomalies:** No validation or signature verification of the downloaded virtualenv.pyz; broad subprocess calls without input sanitization.\n- **Analysis:** The main concern is the dynamic download of virtualenv.pyz without integrity checks, which could be exploited if the source is compromised. No malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk but with supply chain concerns due to unverified external download.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code observed)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2 (low, due to supply chain risk)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build automation, downloads virtualenv.pyz from a URL.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses subprocess for setup and build; network fetches.\n- **Anomalies:** No validation of external scripts; no suspicious inputs.\n- **Analysis:** Standard build script, reliance on external URL is a minor supply chain risk, but no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; typical build automation.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2 (similar supply chain concern)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Automates Skia build, downloads virtualenv.pyz.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Subprocess calls, file writes, environment modifications.\n- **Anomalies:** No validation of downloaded script; reliance on external URL.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern; typical build script with minor supply chain risk.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Builds Skia, downloads virtualenv.pyz.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Subprocesses, file operations, environment variables.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or credentials; external URL for bootstrap.\n- **Analysis:** Standard build process; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build automation, fetches virtualenv.pyz.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Subprocesses, file operations, environment variables.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; typical usage of network fetch.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; standard build script.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and legitimate.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The only concern is the dynamic download of virtualenv.pyz without validation, which is a supply chain risk but not malware per se.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** The main concern is the supply chain risk associated with fetching external scripts without validation, which is a known security concern but not an active threat.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to supply chain concerns)\n\nThese scores reflect that the code is a typical build automation script with a potential supply chain vulnerability but no active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\nThis assessment is consistent across all reports and aligns with the observed code behavior.",
