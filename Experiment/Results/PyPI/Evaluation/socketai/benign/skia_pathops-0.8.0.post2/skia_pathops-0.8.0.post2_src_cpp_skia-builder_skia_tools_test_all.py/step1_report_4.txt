{
  "purpose": "Run all unittests within the current directory and its subdirectories.",
  "sources": "Reads the directory of the current script for test files matching '*_test.py'.",
  "sinks": "Executes test files; no direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Directory path from os.path.dirname(__file__) flows into unittest discover method; test files are loaded and executed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard unittest pattern and practices are used, no suspicious code patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a main() function that discovers and runs unittests matching '*_test.py' in the current directory and subdirectories, then executes main() if run as a script. There are no external data inputs, no network operations, and no sensitive data handling. The code adheres to standard testing practices without any signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test runner script with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard implementation for running Python unittests.",
