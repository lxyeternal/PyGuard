  "purpose": "To discover and run all unittests in the current directory and its subdirectories.",
  "sources": "The code reads the directory path of the current file (__file__) to discover test files.",
  "sinks": "The code executes unittest framework methods; no untrusted data is used in sinks.",
  "flows": "The directory path from os.path.dirname(__file__) flows into unittest's discover method to locate test files, then results are processed and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated features are present. The code is straightforward test runner logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a main function that loads and runs unittests matching '*_test.py' pattern from the current directory, then prints results and raises an exception if any test fails. It does not perform any network operations, handle sensitive data, or execute dynamic code. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple unittest runner script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely automates test execution within the current directory structure.",
