  "purpose": "A simple Python script to discover and run all unittests matching '*_test.py' in the current directory and subdirectories.",
  "sources": "The script reads its own directory path (__file__) to locate test files.",
  "sinks": "The script executes unittest discovery and runs tests; no untrusted data or external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Sources (__file__) lead to unittest discovery, which then executes tests; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unittest runner: it discovers test files matching '*_test.py' in its directory, runs them with verbosity=2, prints results, and raises an exception if tests fail. It uses only standard modules, with no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, straightforward, and safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, with high confidence (1). The code poses no security threat and is typical for a test runner.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python unittest runner with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
