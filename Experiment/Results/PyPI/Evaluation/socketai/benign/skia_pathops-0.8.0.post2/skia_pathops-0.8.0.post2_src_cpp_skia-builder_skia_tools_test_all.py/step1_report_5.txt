{
  "purpose": "The script runs all unittests in the current directory and subdirectories, discovering test files matching '*_test.py'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the directory path where the script is located using os.path.dirname(__file__).",
  "sinks": "The code does not include sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks. It primarily executes tests.",
  "flows": "The flow is from discovering test files in the directory (source) to executing tests with unittest and reporting results (sink).",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns. The license comment and standard unittest usage are typical.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a main() function that discovers test files matching '*_test.py' in its directory. It then runs these tests with verbosity=2 and prints the results. If any tests fail, it raises an exception. The script is a straightforward test runner without any external data inputs or potentially malicious behavior. No obfuscated code, malicious instructions, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test runner script with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is well-structured, and there are no signs of malware, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities.",
