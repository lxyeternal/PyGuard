  "purpose": "This script runs all unit tests within its directory and subdirectories.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file's directory to discover test files; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "The script executes test suites and prints results; no data sinks involved that could lead to leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code flow reads directory information to discover tests, executes them, and prints results; no untrusted data flow to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard unittest discovery and execution patterns, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, defines a main function to discover and run unit tests, and executes this function if run as main. It performs no external network calls, file manipulations beyond discovering test files, or handling untrusted input. The code is straightforward, standard for Python test runners, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python test runner script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions solely to execute unit tests in its directory, with no evident security concerns.",
