  "purpose": "This script is designed to discover and run all unittests within the current directory and its subdirectories, then report the results.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current directory to locate test files matching '*_test.py'.",
  "markets": "The code executes unittest framework functions, such as discovering test files and running them.",
  "flows": "Source: os.path.dirname(__file__) used in unittest discover to locate test files. Sink: unittest.TextTestRunner().run(suite) executes tests; print(repr(results)) outputs results. Data flows from source (directory path) to the test runner, then to output, but no untrusted input directly influences the test execution.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and standard for test runners.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, defines a main function that discovers tests matching '*_test.py' in the current directory, and runs them with verbosity 2. It then prints the results and raises an exception if tests fail. The code does not process or handle any external untrusted input beyond locating files in its directory. No network, environment variables, or user input are involved that could introduce security issues. The code’s purpose is purely to run tests, which is typical and not suspicious. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious code injection points.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unittest runner that discovers and executes tests in the current directory. It poses no security threats or malicious behavior. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
