  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes various presubmit checks, mainly static analysis, formatting, and dependency validation.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated or malicious code, subprocess calls are for code quality tools.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or sabotage detected; malware score is 0.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior) is appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation).  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 is slightly conservative but acceptable, given the external subprocess calls, but these are standard and controlled.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, focusing on code quality, formatting, dependencies.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no data leaks, subprocess calls are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; malware score 0.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 is appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 is reasonable, considering subprocess calls for validation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Presubmit checks, similar scope.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, subprocess calls are for formatting and validation.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; malware score 0.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 is correct.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, subprocess calls are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; malware score 0.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar checks.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no data exfiltration, subprocess calls are typical.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; malware score 0.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.  \n- **Risk:** 0.2, slightly higher but still reasonable given the external command executions.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly conservative but acceptable; the code runs external tools and subprocesses, which could pose some risk if misused, but in this context, they are standard and controlled.\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk:** Given the detailed analysis, a risk score of around 0.1–0.2 is appropriate, reflecting minimal but present external subprocess usage.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (standard for code that runs external validation tools but no malicious intent)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent, and the scores are justified. The code is a standard presubmit script with no malicious or obfuscated content. The low risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure external tools are validated and run in controlled environments. But based on the provided code and reports, there is no evidence of malicious intent.",
