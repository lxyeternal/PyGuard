  "flows": "CHECKOUT_ROOT (source) -> add_to_pythonpath() -> sys.path (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. The code simply modifies sys.path.",
  "analysis": "The script calculates the checkout root directory based on the current file location, then adds this directory to the Python module search path (sys.path). The approach is straightforward and common for including project directories in the module search path. No external input or untrusted data sources are involved. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for adjusting Python's module search path, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
