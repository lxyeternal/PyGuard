  "purpose": "Add the checkout root directory to sys.path to facilitate module imports relative to the project root.",
  "sources": "The script reads its own file path to determine the project root directory.",
  "sinks": "Appending the computed path to sys.path, which influences module import behavior.",
  "flows": "Script computes CHECKOUT_ROOT from its own location, then adds it to sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for environment setup.",
  "analysis": "The code calculates the directory of the current script, derives its parent directory as CHECKOUT_ROOT, and appends this to sys.path. It does not process external input, perform network activity, or execute untrusted code. The logic is simple, well-understood, and common in development scripts. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for setting up the Python environment path. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should be maintained.",
