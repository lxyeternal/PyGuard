  "flows": "Determines the script location -> Computes real path -> Adds to sys.path.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. The code simply modifies sys.path.",
  "analysis": "The script determines its own directory, computes its parent directory as CHECKOUT_ROOT, and appends this path to sys.path for module import purposes. The code is straightforward, with no user input, network activity, or obfuscated constructs. The purpose appears to be to ensure that modules in the checkout root are importable, which is common in development or build environments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility script for modifying sys.path to include the project root directory. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
