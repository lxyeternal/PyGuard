{
  "purpose": "The script modifies the Python import path by adding the checkout root directory, likely for module import purposes during development or runtime.",
  "sources": "Reads the script's directory and the parent directory to determine the checkout root path.",
  "sinks": "Appends a directory path to sys.path, which influences module loading.",
  "flows": "Reads script location -> computes checkout root -> appends to sys.path",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code simply manipulates sys.path without executing untrusted input or external commands.",
  "analysis": "The script calculates the checkout root directory based on its own location, then adds this directory to sys.path via a function. This is a common pattern for local development setups. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network activity. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility script intended for setting up the Python environment. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
