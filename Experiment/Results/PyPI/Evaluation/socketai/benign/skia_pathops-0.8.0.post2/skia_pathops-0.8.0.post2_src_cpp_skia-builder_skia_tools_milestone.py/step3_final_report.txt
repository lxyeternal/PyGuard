  "purpose": "This script updates a header file with a user-specified milestone number, performing input validation, directory navigation, and file writing.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument for milestone number, current script directory for changing working directory",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'include/core/SkMilestone.h' file, reading and outputting its contents",
  "flows": "Input argument validated and then used to format and write into the header file, which is subsequently read and printed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward input validation, directory change, file overwrite, and output. It does not include network activity, code injection, or obfuscation. The purpose is to automate version header updates, a common build utility. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The file overwrite is intentional for version management, not a security flaw.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for updating a milestone number in a header file. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal and inherent to its purpose. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
