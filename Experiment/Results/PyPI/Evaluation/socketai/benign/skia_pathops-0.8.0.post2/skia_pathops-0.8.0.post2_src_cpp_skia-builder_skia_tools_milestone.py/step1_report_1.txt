  "purpose": "The script updates a header file with a new milestone number based on user input.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line argument for milestone number; reads and writes to a specific header file ('include/core/SkMilestone.h')",
  "sinks": "Writes to 'include/core/SkMilestone.h'; reads from it to output its contents",
  "flows": "User input (command-line argument) → validation → file write (update header) → file read and output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No obfuscated code or malicious functions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code validates a single command-line argument intended as an integer milestone number, then updates a header file with this milestone value. It performs basic file operations: opening, writing, and reading. There are no network connections, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors. The script appears to serve a legitimate build or version update function without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a straightforward utility for updating a header file with a milestone number. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and intended for version control or build management purposes.",
