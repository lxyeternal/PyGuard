  "purpose": "Build setup script for a Python extension module interfacing with Skia, managing dependencies, environment variables, and compilation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., BUILD_SKIA_FROM_SOURCE, SKIA_LIBRARY_DIR), files (pyproject.toml, build scripts), subprocess calls (e.g., running build_skia.py, pkg-config), file operations (copying DLLs).",
  "sinks": "Subprocess executions for building dependencies, DLL copying, environment variable reads, file system modifications.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence subprocess commands and build configurations; subprocess calls invoke external build scripts and tools; DLL files are copied based on build outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. External subprocesses are standard for build systems.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical build setup for a Python extension involving external dependencies and environment configurations. No malicious code, obfuscation, or sabotage patterns are present. Subprocess calls are used for building dependencies and copying DLLs, which is standard. The reliance on environment variables and external scripts like 'build_skia.py' and pkg-config is common in build systems. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and potential external manipulation risks, which are typical in build environments but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build configuration for a Python extension with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores are appropriate, reflecting a low but non-zero risk due to external dependencies and environment variable reliance. Overall, the code is safe, transparent, and standard for such build processes.",
