{
  "purpose": "The code defines infrastructure constructs and interfaces for managing Windows domain nodes, EKS clusters, dependencies, and remote command execution within AWS CDK, primarily for resource setup and automation.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, class properties, imported modules (jsii, publication, typing, AWS SDKs). No suspicious data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Calls to jsii.create, jsii.invoke, jsii.get, and jsii.set for resource creation and management. Remote command functions like runPsCommands, runShellCommands, and runPowerShellSSMDocument.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and class properties into resource creation and remote command execution functions. Typical for IaC scripts; no evidence of malicious data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors. Code is straightforward, with standard patterns for resource management and remote execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard AWS CDK infrastructure library utilizing jsii for resource instantiation and configuration. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or sabotage. Remote command functions are typical in automation but could be misused if inputs are malicious; however, no such misuse is evident here. Data flows are consistent with resource setup, and no suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate infrastructure-as-code for managing Windows nodes and EKS clusters in AWS. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is appropriate given its functionality. All reports correctly assess the code as safe.",
