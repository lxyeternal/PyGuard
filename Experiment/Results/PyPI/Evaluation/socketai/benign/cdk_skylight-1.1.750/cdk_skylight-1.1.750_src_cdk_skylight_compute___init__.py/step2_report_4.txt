  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically and compare them to the code to determine the actual security posture.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Code Context:**\n- The code is a set of AWS CDK constructs, interfaces, and functions for managing Windows domain nodes, EKS clusters, dependencies, and remote command execution via SSM.\n- It relies heavily on `jsii` for resource creation and invocation.\n- The code appears to be infrastructure-as-code, focusing on resource configuration, dependency management, and remote command execution.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious payloads are present.\n- No obfuscation or code patterns indicating malicious intent.\n- The use of `jsii.create`, `jsii.invoke`, and `jsii.get` are standard in CDK constructs.\n- Input parameters are validated with `check_type`, and properties are managed via getters/setters.\n- The code facilitates remote command execution (e.g., `runPsCommands`, `runShellCommands`, `runPowerShellSSMDocument`) which is typical for infrastructure automation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No actual issues or malicious code are present.** The code is a legitimate infrastructure configuration library.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Infrastructure configuration for Windows nodes and EKS.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; standard use of `jsii` and CDK constructs.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n- **Security risk:** Very low (0.1)  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Management of Windows nodes, dependencies, and remote command execution.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; functions for remote commands are standard in automation.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n- **Security risk:** Low (0.2)  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Infrastructure management for Windows EC2 and EKS.\n- **Analysis:** No backdoors, secret leaks, or malicious code; standard resource management.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n- **Security risk:** Low (0.2)  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** AWS resource management for Windows nodes and clusters.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; functions are typical for infrastructure code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n- **Security risk:** Low (0.2)  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, managing EC2/EKS resources.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; standard infrastructure code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0  \n- **Security risk:** Very low (0.0)  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 across all reports.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation detected).  \n- **Risk score:** Given the code's purpose and the lack of malicious indicators, a low risk score is justified, around 0.1–0.2.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** (no signs of malicious code or payloads)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** (the code is clear and structured)\n- **Risk:** **0.1–0.2** (standard infrastructure code with remote execution capabilities, but no malicious intent)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code's nature. The code is a standard AWS CDK-based infrastructure library for managing Windows nodes and EKS clusters, with remote command execution features. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic is evident.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: **0.0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0.0**  \n- Risk score: **0.2** (considering remote execution features but no malicious intent)\n\nThis supply chain review confirms the code's integrity and security posture as benign.",
