{
  "purpose": "The code defines constructs, interfaces, and functions related to managing Windows EC2 instances, EKS clusters, and dependencies in AWS CDK for deployment and configuration automation.",
  "sources": "Data input from parameters, method arguments, environment variables (via secrets), and resource properties.",
  "sinks": "Method invocations, resource creation, and property setting that could modify infrastructure or trigger actions like running scripts, opening ports, or deploying resources.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and secret values flow into method calls such as addAdDependency, runPowerShellSSMDocument, openRDP, and addUserData, which can execute scripts or modify security groups or resources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity present. Usage of standard SDK and construct methods with no hidden payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class and interface definitions for AWS infrastructure components using jsii and CDK. It includes methods to configure EC2 instances, EKS clusters, security groups, and run scripts via SSM. All interactions are within the expected scope of infrastructure as code, with no indications of malicious intent. The functions are designed for automation and deployment, and there are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or covert channels. The code adheres to standard patterns, with no unusual or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate infrastructure management library intended for deploying and configuring AWS resources. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code performs typical setup tasks for Windows EC2 and EKS clusters without any suspicious activities.",
