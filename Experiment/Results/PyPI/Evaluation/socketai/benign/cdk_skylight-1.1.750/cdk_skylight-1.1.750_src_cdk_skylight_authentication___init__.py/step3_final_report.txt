{
  "purpose": "The code defines AWS CDK constructs for managing AWS Directory Service resources, including Active Directory and related configurations. It primarily involves resource creation, property management, and configuration validation.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters, type hints, and external libraries such as jsii, publication, and AWS SDK modules. No untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'jsii.invoke' and property setters for resource creation and configuration. No external data exfiltration, network connections, or command execution outside AWS resource provisioning are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through property setters and method calls into resource creation functions like 'jsii.create' and 'jsii.invoke'. These are standard for CDK constructs and do not involve untrusted external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected. The code follows typical infrastructure as code patterns without suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard AWS CDK module for managing Directory Service resources, using typical patterns such as class definitions, property accessors, and jsii method calls. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise are evident. The resource creation and configuration are parameter-driven, with no hardcoded secrets or network activity. The use of type hints and runtime checks enhances safety. Overall, the code is clean, well-structured, and aligns with best practices for infrastructure code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe AWS CDK implementation for managing Active Directory resources. It shows no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or supply chain attack vectors. The minimal security risk pertains to configuration complexity, not malicious activity.",
