{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes, interfaces, enums, and functions related to AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory integration, primarily for use within AWS CDK constructs for infrastructure provisioning.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from function parameters, class properties, environment (via imported modules like 'jsii', 'publication'), and external dependencies such as AWS SDK and secrets manager.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include jsii.invoke (which executes methods), jsii.create (which instantiates objects), and property setters that can set configuration data or secrets.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through type-checked functions into class constructors or methods (e.g., create_ad_group, create_service_account, create_worker), and then possibly triggers external actions via jsii method calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No signs of obfuscation or malicious logic such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. The code relies on standard AWS CDK constructs, type hints, and JSII invocation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions, interfaces, enum declarations, and type checking stubs. It employs standard patterns for CDK resource provisioning and configuration management. No suspicious data handling, network calls, or code that would indicate malicious intent is present. The use of jsii for cross-language support and property management aligns with common CDK practices. All data flows are confined to configuration and object instantiation without any hidden or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The source code appears to be a standard AWS CDK construct implementation for managing AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory resources. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It functions as intended to facilitate directory service setup and management within AWS infrastructure.",
