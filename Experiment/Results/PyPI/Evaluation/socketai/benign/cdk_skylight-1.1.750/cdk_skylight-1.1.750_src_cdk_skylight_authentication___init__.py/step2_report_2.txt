  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's security implications, potential vulnerabilities, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard resource setup for AWS Directory Service and related resources. Uses typical AWS SDK, type hints, and runtime checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Calls to 'jsii.invoke' and 'jsii.create' are standard for CDK constructs; data flows are confined to configuration parameters.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is typical for infrastructure deployment.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior, safe for use. Confidence is high (1), malware score is 0, risk is 0.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—standard CDK resource management for AWS Managed Microsoft AD.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses 'jsii.invoke' and property accessors, typical for resource creation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation. All patterns align with legitimate CDK constructs.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, safe to deploy. Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.2 (slightly above zero due to inherent risks in resource configuration).\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, CDK constructs for AD management. Uses 'jsii' and property setters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Similar pattern—inputs into 'jsii.invoke' and 'create' methods.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. The code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very low malware risk, standard patterns. Risk score 0.2 is acceptable, given configuration complexity.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard resource management with typical property and method patterns.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses 'jsii' for resource creation, with no suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors. All patterns are typical for CDK modules.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Very low malware likelihood, standard security risk. Scores are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports—standard CDK resource management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses 'jsii' and property setters, typical for CDK constructs.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity detected, low security risk.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2) in some reports due to the inherent risks in resource configuration but not because of malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical AWS CDK module defining constructs for Active Directory and related resources.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- Use of 'jsii' and 'publication' is standard for CDK modules.\n- Data flows are confined to configuration and resource setup, with no external data exfiltration or command execution outside AWS resource provisioning.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation patterns)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, related to resource configuration complexity but not malicious)\n\n---\n\n**Final Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard AWS CDK module for managing Active Directory resources. It poses no security threat or supply chain risk based on the provided snippets and analysis.",
