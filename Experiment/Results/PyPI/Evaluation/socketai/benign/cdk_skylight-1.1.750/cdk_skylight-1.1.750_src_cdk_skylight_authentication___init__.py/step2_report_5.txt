  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine the presence of issues, the validity of their assessments, and appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose:**  \nDescribes classes and functions for managing AWS Directory Service, focusing on resource creation and configuration.\n\n**Sources & Sinks:**  \nStandard AWS SDK and CDK constructs, with data flowing into method calls like `jsii.invoke`. No untrusted input handling or external data processing.\n\n**Flow & Anomalies:**  \nNo signs of malicious data flow, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is typical for CDK resource setup.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:**  \n- No malware, suspicious behavior, or supply chain attack indicators.\n- The code is standard infrastructure code with safety checks.\n- **Score Justification:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (no malicious code)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n  - Risk: 0 (safe)  \n\n**Verdict:** Fully aligned with the report's conclusion. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose:**  \nDefines classes and interfaces for AWS Managed Microsoft AD within CDK.\n\n**Sources & Sinks:**  \nUses standard CDK patterns; potential sinks are `jsii.invoke` and property setters, but these are typical for resource provisioning.\n\n**Flow & Anomalies:**  \nNo malicious data handling or obfuscation. The code is straightforward, with no signs of backdoors or malicious logic.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:**  \n- No malware or malicious behavior detected.\n- The report's confidence is high (0.9), and the conclusion is appropriate.\n- **Score Justification:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n  - Risk: 0 (no security issues)\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose:**  \nDefines classes and interfaces for AWS Directory Service, focusing on resource configuration.\n\n**Sources & Sinks:**  \nStandard property and method calls; potential sinks are resource creation functions (`jsii.invoke`, `jsii.create`), but these are expected in CDK.\n\n**Flow & Anomalies:**  \nNo suspicious data flows, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code aligns with typical CDK constructs.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:**  \n- No malicious activity or supply chain concerns.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.95), but justified.\n- Security risk is minimal (0.2), mainly because resource creation depends on user input, which is standard.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (due to resource configuration based on input)\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose:**  \nDefines classes and interfaces for managing AWS Directory Service resources.\n\n**Sources & Sinks:**  \nUses standard CDK patterns; potential sinks include resource creation via `jsii.invoke`, which could be misused if fed malicious data.\n\n**Flow & Anomalies:**  \nNo signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code is typical for infrastructure as code.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:**  \n- No malicious intent or supply chain issues.\n- The code is straightforward, with no hidden behaviors.\n- Confidence is high (0.95).\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0 (safe)\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose:**  \nDefines classes and interfaces for AWS Directory Service management.\n\n**Sources & Sinks:**  \nUses standard CDK resource creation methods; potential sinks are resource creation calls, but these are expected.\n\n**Flow & Anomalies:**  \nNo signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is typical for CDK constructs.\n\n**Analysis & Conclusion:**  \n- No malicious behavior or supply chain issues.\n- Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n## **Overall Summary & Final Scores**\n\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly identify no malicious code.  \n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected in any report.  \n- **Risk:** All are low, with minor concerns only about resource configuration inputs, which are standard.\n\n### **My Final Estimation:**\n\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|---------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| 1       | 0               | 0                 | 0          |\n| 2       | 0               | 0                 | 0          |\n| 3       | 0               | 0                 | 0.2        |\n| 4       | 0               | 0                 | 0          |\n| 5       | 0               | 0                 | 0          |\n\n**Note:** The slightly elevated risk scores in some reports reflect typical configuration and resource management activities, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n\n- **No evidence of supply chain attacks, malware, or obfuscation.**  \n- **The code is standard for AWS CDK constructs managing Directory Service resources.**  \n- **Potential sinks are normal resource creation calls, which are expected and not malicious.**  \n- **Type checks and property validations are standard safety measures.**\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores are reasonable. The code appears safe, with no malicious or obfuscated content detected.",
