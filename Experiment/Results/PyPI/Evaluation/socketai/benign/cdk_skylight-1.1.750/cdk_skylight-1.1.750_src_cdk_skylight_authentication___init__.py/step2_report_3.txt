  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's actual content, data flows, potential vulnerabilities, and the validity of the given scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Describes standard CDK constructs for AWS Directory Service. Sources are typical—parameters, type hints, external libraries.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Calls to `jsii.invoke` and property setters are standard for resource creation. No untrusted input processing or external data exfiltration evident.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is typical infrastructure code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: No malicious activity detected. Confidence is high (1). Malware and obfuscation scores are 0, and security risk is 0.\n\n**Verdict**: The report's conclusion aligns with the code content. The risk scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Similar to Report 1—standard AWS CDK constructs for AD management.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Uses `jsii.invoke`, property accessors, and type checking functions. No evidence of malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The code relies on standard CDK patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: No malicious behavior, high confidence (0.9). Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk minimal.\n\n**Verdict**: The assessment is consistent with the code. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Again, standard CDK constructs for AD resources.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Resource creation via `jsii.invoke`, property setters, and type hints. No untrusted input processing or external network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No suspicious patterns or obfuscation. The code is typical for infrastructure as code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: High confidence (0.95), no malware or obfuscation. Security risk is minimal (0.2), which is acceptable given the resource configuration context.\n\n**Verdict**: The report's reasoning matches the code. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Standard CDK resource definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Uses `jsii.create`, `jsii.invoke`, property accessors—standard for resource provisioning.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: Very high confidence (0.95). No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent detected.\n\n**Verdict**: The assessment aligns with the code content. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Similar to previous reports—standard resource management.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: Resource creation and configuration via `jsii` and property setters. No evidence of malicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: High confidence (0.9). No malware signals, minimal security risk.\n\n**Verdict**: The report's conclusion is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis\n\n- **Code Content**: All reports describe code that is a typical AWS CDK module for managing Active Directory resources. It uses standard patterns, type hints, runtime type checks, and jsii method calls.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation**: No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. The code interacts only with AWS SDKs, CDK constructs, and standard libraries.\n- **Data Flows & Sinks**: Data flows are confined to configuration parameters, resource creation, and property setting—no external data exfiltration or malicious network activity.\n- **Scores**: The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code. The obfuscated scores are also 0, matching the clarity of the code. Risk scores are low, reflecting the nature of the code as infrastructure configuration.\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 is correct; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score**: Given the code's purpose and lack of malicious behavior, scores around 0.1–0.2 are reasonable.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0.1–0.2 (due to resource configuration, but no inherent security risk in the code itself)\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. The code is safe, standard infrastructure code with no malicious intent.",
