{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python package for 'cdk-skylight', an AWS CDK library providing constructs for managing Microsoft ecosystem resources such as Active Directory, Windows nodes, FSx, and related integrations.",
  "sources": "Module imports, version checks, and module registration routines; no external data input or dynamic resource creation in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No external network calls, command executions, or data leaks are present in static analysis; methods like createADGroup(), createFolder(), runPsCommands() are designed to execute at runtime when invoked, not during import.",
  "flows": "Method signatures indicate source-to-sink flows occur during runtime invocation, not at static load time; no active data flows are observable in this static code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present; the code is standard for an SDK setup with class definitions and module registration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical infrastructure SDK setup, involving module imports, version-dependent type checking, and registration routines. Methods intended for resource management are only executed when called explicitly during runtime. No malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscation are evident. The static code is clean, well-structured, and aligns with standard practices for AWS CDK constructs. The absence of secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns indicates a benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The static analysis confirms that the code is a legitimate, non-malicious infrastructure SDK for AWS CDK related to Microsoft services. No signs of supply chain attacks, malware, or obfuscation are detected. The low risk and zero malware scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
