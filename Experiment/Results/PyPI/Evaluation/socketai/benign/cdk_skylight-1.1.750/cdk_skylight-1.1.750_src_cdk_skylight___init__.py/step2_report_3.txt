  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, behavior, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a Python module for 'cdk-skylight', defining constructs for AWS infrastructure related to Microsoft products. It mainly sets up classes, methods, and module registration routines.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct execution of commands, resource modifications, or data exfiltration during static analysis. The methods like `createADGroup()`, `createFolder()`, `runPsCommands()`, etc., are designed to execute commands or modify resources but only when invoked at runtime.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, no obfuscation. The code is standard for an infrastructure SDK.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, with no malicious intent. The methods are for resource management and only execute during runtime when called explicitly.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious code detected)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (clear code)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, mainly due to potential misuse if user executes malicious commands, but no active threat in static code)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on package setup, version handling, and module registration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No network or external data flows, no command execution during static analysis.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. The code is typical for a Python package setup.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard package initialization with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (minimal, just setup routines)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, focusing on module setup and version checks.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct external activity or data flows.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No secrets or suspicious logic. The version check and typeguard usage are standard.\n- **Conclusion:** Typical SDK setup, no malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, module initialization, type checking, and jsii registration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or network activity.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** Standard package setup routines.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar setup code for AWS CDK constructs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or command execution during static analysis.\n- **Anomalies & Behavior:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard library setup, no malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports show no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or active exploits.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Clear, well-structured code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low; these are infrastructure SDK setup routines, which are inherently low risk unless misused at runtime.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.  \n**Risk:** **0.1** — Slight risk if someone misuses the provided methods at runtime, but no active threat in static code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate open-source infrastructure SDK for AWS CDK, providing constructs for Microsoft ecosystem integrations. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements based on static analysis. The methods intended for command execution or resource modification are safe in the context of proper usage and only execute when invoked during runtime.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further detailed analysis or specific focus on any part.",
