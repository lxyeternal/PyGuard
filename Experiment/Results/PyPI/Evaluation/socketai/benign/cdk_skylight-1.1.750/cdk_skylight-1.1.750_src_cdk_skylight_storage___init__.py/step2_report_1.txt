  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code manages AWS FSx Windows via CDK constructs, with typical imports and type hints.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** JSII calls (create, invoke) are standard for CDK resource management. Data flows from method args into these calls, no anomalies.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. Use of typeguard is standard for runtime type safety.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that this is a legitimate infrastructure code with no malware is accurate. Confidence 0.9 is appropriate.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware score 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 is reasonable, given it's infrastructure code with minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent observations:\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 align with the description.\n\n**Score Justification:** Accurate and conservative; no issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- Same pattern: standard AWS CDK constructs, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.1 are appropriate.\n\n**Score Justification:** No concerns, the low risk reflects the typical infrastructure code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- Consistent with previous analyses:\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2 are fitting.\n\n**Score Justification:** No malicious indicators, the risk is just a baseline.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- The most confident assessment (confidence 1), no obfuscation or malware, standard resource management.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.\n\n**Score Justification:** Completely aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; set at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, indicating clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) in most reports, reflecting the inherent risk in infrastructure code but no active threats.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, standard code patterns.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Minimal, typical of infrastructure code, no active vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately cautious. No changes are necessary to their scores or conclusions. The code appears to be legitimate, well-structured infrastructure code with no malicious intent.",
