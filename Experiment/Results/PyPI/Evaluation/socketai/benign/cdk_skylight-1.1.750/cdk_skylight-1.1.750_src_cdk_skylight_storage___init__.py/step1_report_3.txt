{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of classes, interfaces, and functions for managing AWS infrastructure related to FSx Windows file systems using the AWS CDK and jsii for language interoperability.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from type hints, function parameters, and environment configurations, primarily through class initializers and property setters/getters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include jsii.invoke (which calls AWS SDK operations), jsii.set (which sets properties potentially affecting AWS resources), and the creation of AWS resources such as file systems and domain workers.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through type checks and then into resource creation or configuration functions like createFolder or createWorker, which invoke AWS SDK calls via jsii.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; the code appears to follow standard AWS CDK patterns. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors are evident. The code uses environment and parameter references appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical AWS CDK construct module, utilizing jsii for cross-language support, defining classes for managing FSx Windows file systems and associated parameters. It contains type checks, property accessors, and method invocations that interact with AWS SDK resources. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The functions perform expected resource provisioning tasks with standard security practices (e.g., using secrets manager for credentials).",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate infrastructure-as-code for AWS resource management. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It employs standard patterns for CDK constructs, with no suspicious or malicious logic detected.",
