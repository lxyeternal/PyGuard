{
  "purpose": "Defines AWS CDK constructs and interfaces for managing FSx Windows file systems and related parameters within a cloud infrastructure.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (jsii, publication, aws_cdk modules, etc.), environment variables (potentially via imported modules), function parameters, and class properties.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of jsii.create and jsii.invoke methods, property setters, and type casting functions that could potentially execute or modify system or cloud resources.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to constructors and methods flow into jsii creation/invocation calls; property setters and getters pass data to/from jsii layer, which interfaces with underlying cloud resources.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, network connections, or suspicious data handling observed. Use of jsii and cloud resource management functions is standard for infrastructure as code. The typeguard function dynamically checks types, but no malicious pattern is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions, interface protocols, property accessors, and type-checking functions used in AWS CDK constructs. It leverages the jsii framework for cross-language resource management and standard AWS SDK interactions. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or backdoors are present. The logic is consistent with typical infrastructure code, with no suspicious behavior. No data exfiltration, malicious commands, or malware indicators identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard infrastructure-as-code definitions for AWS resources, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It performs type checks and resource provisioning in a typical manner without any suspicious patterns or embedded malware.",
