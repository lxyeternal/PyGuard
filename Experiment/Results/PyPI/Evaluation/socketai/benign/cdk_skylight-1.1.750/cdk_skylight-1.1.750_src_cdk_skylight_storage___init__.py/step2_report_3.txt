  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the presence of issues, their reasoning, and whether the assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report states the code manages AWS FSx Windows resources via CDK constructs, with standard imports, type hints, and method parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Calls to jsii.create/invoke and property setters, typical for CDK constructs. No external or suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is straightforward.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard infrastructure code, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — reasonable given the context. The low risk score reflects minimal concern, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—standard AWS CDK resource management, no suspicious imports or behaviors.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Use of jsii.create/invoke, property setters/getters—expected patterns.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. No environment manipulation or network activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate infrastructure code, standard patterns, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines AWS CDK constructs, interfaces, and resource creation methods. Uses typical imports and parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Invocation of jsii methods, property setters, and getters—standard for CDK.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. Uses environment references properly.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate resource management code, no malicious signals.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports—standard CDK constructs, properties, and resource management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Use of jsii for resource creation and configuration, typical for CDK.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate infrastructure code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, standard AWS CDK resource definitions, interfaces, and property management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses jsii for resource management, no suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical infrastructure code, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, which aligns with the clear, standard code structure.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2) in some cases, reflecting minimal concern, which is justified given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, typical infrastructure code risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is legitimate, well-structured infrastructure-as-code, with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No issues found in the code.  \n- Scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.  \n- The overall security posture based on these reports is high confidence that the code is safe.",
