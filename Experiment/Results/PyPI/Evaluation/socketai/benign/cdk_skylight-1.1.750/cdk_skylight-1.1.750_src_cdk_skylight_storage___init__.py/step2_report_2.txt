  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, following the outlined steps:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** The code appears to be a standard AWS CDK construct for managing FSx Windows resources. No malicious or suspicious code is evident.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No logical errors or flaws are apparent. The typeguard functions are standard for runtime type safety.\n- **Scores review:** Malware score is 0, risk score is 0.2, which seems reasonable given the code's nature.\n- **Risk justification:** The risk score is low because this is infrastructure code, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** Zero, consistent with the code's content.\n- **Assumptions:** No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly identifies the code as standard.\n- **Scores consistency:** Appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is legitimate, no malicious behavior detected. The high confidence (0.9) aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No signs of malicious activity; the code manages AWS resources via CDK.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No evident flaws; patterns are typical for AWS CDK constructs.\n- **Scores review:** Malware at 0, risk at 0.2; appropriate.\n- **Risk justification:** Slightly higher than 0, but justified given the resource management context.\n- **Malware score:** 0, matches the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions; the report dismisses malicious intent correctly.\n- **Scores consistency:** Yes.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard infrastructure code, no malware or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, the code is a typical AWS CDK construct.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores review:** Malware 0, risk 0.1; reasonable.\n- **Risk justification:** Very low, as expected for infrastructure code.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Assumptions:** No assumptions about vulnerabilities; the report correctly dismisses malicious behavior.\n- **Scores consistency:** Yes.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, with no malicious signals.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, standard CDK construct code.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws or obfuscation.\n- **Scores review:** Malware 0, risk 0.2; fitting.\n- **Risk justification:** Low, typical for infrastructure code.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions.\n- **Scores consistency:** Yes.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a normal, safe infrastructure module.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No flaws or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores review:** Malware 0, risk 0.0; appropriate.\n- **Risk justification:** Minimal risk.\n- **Malware score:** 0, matches the code content.\n- **Assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions.\n- **Scores consistency:** Yes.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is standard, legitimate infrastructure code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly vary between 0.0 and 0.2, reflecting the low-risk nature of infrastructure code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — very low, considering the code manages cloud resources without sensitive data or backdoors.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, and the code appears to be a legitimate, standard AWS CDK infrastructure module with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
