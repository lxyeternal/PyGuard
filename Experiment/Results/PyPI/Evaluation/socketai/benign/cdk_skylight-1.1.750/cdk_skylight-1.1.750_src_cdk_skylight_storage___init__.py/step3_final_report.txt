{
  "purpose": "The code defines AWS CDK constructs and interfaces for managing Amazon FSx Windows resources, including creating folders and worker nodes within a specified VPC, utilizing jsii for resource provisioning.",
  "sources": "Method parameters (scope, id, props, worker, folder_name, secret_name, domain_name, domain_password), property getters, and internal function calls to jsii.create and jsii.invoke.",
  "sinks": "Calls to jsii.create and jsii.invoke, property setters and getters, which interact with AWS CDK resource management functions; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into jsii resource creation and method invocations; no suspicious or malicious data flow paths detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; use of standard typeguard checks and jsii calls typical for CDK constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard AWS CDK infrastructure module implementing resource classes, interfaces, and configuration properties for FSx Windows. It employs typical patterns such as jsii for resource management, type hints, and runtime type checks. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns and no suspicious data flows or embedded secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate infrastructure-as-code for managing AWS FSx Windows resources. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to misconfiguration risks inherent in infrastructure code, but no active threats are evident.",
