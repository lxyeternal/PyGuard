{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a Python package called 'cdk-skylight' by loading its metadata from a JSON string, reading a README file for the long description, and invoking setuptools.setup to prepare the package for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a JSON string to define package metadata and reads from 'README.md' to set the long description.",
  "sinks": "The setup function potentially writes files during package build/distribution but does not directly handle untrusted data; no external sinks handling untrusted data is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the JSON string into the 'kwargs' dictionary, then into 'setuptools.setup'; the README content flows from file into 'kwargs'. No external untrusted data sources are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code primarily handles package setup with static data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, loads package metadata from a static JSON string, reads a local README.md file for description, and invokes setuptools.setup with this data. There is no dynamic code execution, no external data fetching, no user input handling, and no suspicious logic. All data used is static or from trusted sources. The process follows standard Python packaging procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly performs package configuration tasks using static data and standard libraries.",
