  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Summary:** The code loads package metadata from a static JSON string, reads README.md, and calls setuptools.setup().  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, no suspicious code, no obfuscation. All operations are standard for package setup.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing static data and safe file reading.  \n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior, dynamic code, or external untrusted inputs.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates standard package setup with static data and safe file reading.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard setup with static data.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious or suspicious behaviors detected.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Summary:** Same analysis, standard package setup.  \n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent or suspicious code.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is straightforward, standard, and safe.  \n- **Malware, obfuscation, or security risks:** None detected or indicated.  \n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks in this code. It is a typical setup script for a Python package, with static data and standard operations.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe and standard.  \n- No changes needed in scoring.  \n- The scores reflect the actual risk level appropriately.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
