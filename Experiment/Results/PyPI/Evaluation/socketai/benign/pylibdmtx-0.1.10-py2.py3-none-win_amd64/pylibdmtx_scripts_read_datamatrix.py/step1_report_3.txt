  "purpose": "Read and decode DataMatrix barcodes from image files provided as command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Input image files specified as positional command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Printing decoded barcode data to standard output.",
  "flows": "User provides image filenames -> Images are opened using PIL -> DataMatrix codes are decoded using pylibdmtx -> Decoded data is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code. Usage of standard libraries and known open-source modules. No suspicious dynamic code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script takes image filenames as input, opens each image with PIL, decodes DataMatrix barcodes using pylibdmtx, and prints out the barcode data. The code is straightforward and uses well-known libraries without any suspicious behaviors. No hidden code, no malicious data leaks, and no external network interactions are present. The code appears to serve a benign purpose of barcode decoding. No anomalies or signs of malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple barcode reader utility with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It relies on open-source libraries and performs expected functions without suspicious activity.",
