{
  "purpose": "To read and decode DataMatrix barcodes from provided image files",
  "sources": "Input image file paths provided via command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "Decoded barcode data printed to standard output",
  "flows": "Image file paths (source) are opened with PIL.Image.open, processed by pylibdmtx.decode, and the barcode data is printed (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Use of external libraries appears standard for barcode decoding. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script processes image files specified as command-line arguments, opens each image using PIL, and decodes barcodes using pylibdmtx. The decoded data is printed directly. There are no network calls, data exfiltration, or system modification activities. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious logic or suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign barcode decoding utility with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It uses standard libraries and methods with no suspicious code paths.",
