  "purpose": "The script reads DataMatrix barcodes from image files specified by the user.",
  "sources": "Input image files provided as command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "Printing barcode data to standard output",
  "flows": "Image files -> decode function -> print barcode data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses argparse for command-line argument parsing, PIL to open images, and pylibdmtx to decode DataMatrix barcodes. It processes each image and outputs the barcode data. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code appears to be straightforward barcode reading functionality without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard barcode reader that processes images and outputs decoded data. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for barcode decoding tasks.",
