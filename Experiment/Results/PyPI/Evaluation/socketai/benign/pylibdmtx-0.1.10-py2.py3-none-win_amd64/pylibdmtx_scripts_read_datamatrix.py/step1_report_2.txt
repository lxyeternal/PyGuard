  "purpose": "The code reads datamatrix barcodes from image files provided as command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "The code reads input image file paths from command-line arguments (`args.image`).",
  "sinks": "The code outputs barcode data to standard output via print statements.",
  "flows": "Input image paths (source) are read from command-line args, images are opened with PIL.Image.open, and barcode data is decoded and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No evidence of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts image file paths as input, opens each image using PIL, and decodes datamatrix barcodes with pylibdmtx. The barcode data is printed directly. The code does not handle or transmit data over the network, access environment variables, or execute dynamic code. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed. It is a straightforward barcode reader script with standard library usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate barcode reading utility with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It simply processes images to extract barcode data and outputs the results. No security risks or malware are detected.",
