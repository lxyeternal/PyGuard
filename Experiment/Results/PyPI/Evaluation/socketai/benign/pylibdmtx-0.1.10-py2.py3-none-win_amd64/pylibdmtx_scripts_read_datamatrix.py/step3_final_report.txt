  "purpose": "Reads datamatrix barcodes in images provided as command-line arguments",
  "sources": "Image files opened via PIL.Image.open for each filename provided as input",
  "sinks": "Output printed to stdout with barcode.data for each decoded barcode",
  "flows": "Image files are read from disk, passed to decode, and decoded data is printed",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of standard libraries with no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple barcode reader that accepts image filenames, opens each image, decodes DataMatrix barcodes using pylibdmtx, and prints the decoded data. It uses standard libraries (argparse, PIL, pylibdmtx) with no network activity, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behaviors. The code's logic is clear and direct, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward barcode decoding utility with no malicious or suspicious features. The reports accurately assess its safety, and the scoring aligns with its functionality. No further action is necessary; the code is safe.",
