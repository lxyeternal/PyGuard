  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, external files, network sources, standard library functions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data processing functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., environment variables, files) to sinks (e.g., network, files) without evidence of malicious manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either absent or benign, utilizing standard Python constructs. No malicious activities such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are observed. The security risk is minimal, and confidence in benign nature is high where code is present. In absence of code, scores appropriately reflect uncertainty.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. Scores are consistent with the analysis, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
