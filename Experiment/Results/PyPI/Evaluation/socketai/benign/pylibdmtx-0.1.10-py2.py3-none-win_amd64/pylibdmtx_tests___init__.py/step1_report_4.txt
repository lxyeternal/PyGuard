  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script for data processing or utility functions, with no clear malicious intent or harmful actions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from variables, function parameters, environment variables, and potentially external files or network sources depending on context (if present).",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data to console, files, network sockets, or logs. Potential sinks depend on functions like print, open/write, or network calls if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions, environment variables, or external data sources through processing functions to sinks like output statements, files, or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code structure appears straightforward. No unusual dynamic execution, eval, or exec usage detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is examined systematically for source inputs, processing steps, and output or sink points. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No evidence of data leakage, unsafe SQL, or insecure number generation. The overall code appears typical and benign based on provided content.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the analysis. It seems to be a legitimate Python script without any embedded malware or security concerns.",
