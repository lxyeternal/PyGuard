  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of DataMatrix barcode encoding and decoding, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and minimal security risk score (~0.2) are justified based on its functionality and resource management."
