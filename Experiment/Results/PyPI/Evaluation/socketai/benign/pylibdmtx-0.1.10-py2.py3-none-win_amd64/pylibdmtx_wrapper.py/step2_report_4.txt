  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Wrapper for libdmtx, no malicious intent.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard library loading and function wrapping.  \n- Anomalies: None detected; no obfuscation, credentials, or malicious patterns.  \n- Analysis: Straightforward binding layer, no suspicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, no malware or malicious behavior.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low, justified by minimal external risk, e.g., potential misuse).  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Low-level wrapper for Data Matrix encoding/decoding.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard external library calls, no untrusted data handling evident.  \n- Anomalies: None; no obfuscation or malicious code.  \n- Analysis: Typical ctypes wrapper, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, legitimate library interface.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 (appropriate).  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Wrapper for barcode/QR code processing.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard dynamic loading and function invocation.  \n- Anomalies: None; no suspicious patterns.  \n- Analysis: Typical ctypes-based binding, no malicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, intended for legitimate use.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low, reasonable).  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Wrapper for barcode/matrix decoding.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard function calls to external library.  \n- Anomalies: None; no suspicious code or obfuscation.  \n- Analysis: Standard binding, no malicious activity.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, legitimate interface.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (appropriate).  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Wrapper for libdmtx, no malicious intent.  \n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: Standard dynamic library calls.  \n- Anomalies: None; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.  \n- Analysis: Typical ctypes binding, no malicious behavior.  \n- Conclusion: Safe, straightforward library interface.  \n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (reasonable).  \n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, no backdoors, no code injection, no network activity, and no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports show clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** Very low, justified by the fact that this code is a low-level wrapper around a well-known open-source library for barcode processing, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (consistent with the reports' assessments)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, open-source wrapper around the libdmtx library, with no indications of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low risk score reflects the inherent trust in the external library and the nature of the wrapper, which does not perform any suspicious operations.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo action needed beyond standard security practices for dependencies. Continue monitoring for updates or unusual behavior in the underlying libdmtx library.",
