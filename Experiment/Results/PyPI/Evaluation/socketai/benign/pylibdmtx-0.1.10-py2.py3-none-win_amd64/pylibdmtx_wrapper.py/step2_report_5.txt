  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, logic, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a low-level wrapper for libdmtx, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. It emphasizes the dynamic loading of shared libraries and the absence of suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is indeed a standard ctypes wrapper, with functions wrapping external C library calls. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration is present. The high confidence (0.9) seems appropriate.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0.0 aligns with the analysis. Security risk is low (0.2), considering potential misuse if the library is used improperly, but not malicious in itself.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a straightforward wrapper with no malicious intent. It notes that functions accept untrusted inputs but does not imply malicious activity.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's purpose is to interface with libdmtx, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. The confidence is 1, which is justified given the code's nature.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0.0 is correct. The security risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the report describes the code as a standard ctypes binding for libdmtx, with no malicious patterns or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code's structure and purpose are consistent across reports. No malicious activities are evident.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0.0 and low security risk are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a standard wrapper, with no malicious behaviors or supply chain sabotage signs.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code only loads libraries, defines structures, and wraps functions. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious payloads are detected.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score remains at 0.0, consistent with the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing the code's role as a ctypes wrapper with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious patterns or malicious logic are present.\n\n- **Score justification:** Malware score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** No. All reports agree that the code is a legitimate low-level binding to libdmtx.\n\n- **Obfuscation or malicious intent:** None detected. The code is straightforward, using standard ctypes patterns.\n\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Risks:** The overall security risk is low, primarily associated with correct usage rather than malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** **0.0**  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (minimal, mainly due to potential misuse, not malicious intent)\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a standard, well-structured Python wrapper for a C library, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low security risk score accounts for potential misuse in larger applications but not inherent maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** Based on the detailed review, the code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious content. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.",
