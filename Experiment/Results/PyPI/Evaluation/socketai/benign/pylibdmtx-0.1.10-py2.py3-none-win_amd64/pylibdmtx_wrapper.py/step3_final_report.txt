  "purpose": "Low-level wrapper around libdmtx's interface for barcode processing.",
  "sources": "Library loading functions, function wrappers, data structure definitions, version checks.",
  "sinks": "External C library functions invoked via ctypes; no untrusted data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "Library load -> function calls -> data structure manipulation; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; version-dependent structure definitions are normal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward ctypes-based binding to the libdmtx C library, defining data structures, constants, and function signatures. It dynamically loads the shared library, wraps functions for barcode encoding/decoding, and manages data structures for images and barcode regions. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of dynamic loading and ctypes is typical for such bindings and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the initial reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent wrapper for libdmtx with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score appropriately reflects the minimal inherent security risk, assuming the shared library source is trustworthy.",
