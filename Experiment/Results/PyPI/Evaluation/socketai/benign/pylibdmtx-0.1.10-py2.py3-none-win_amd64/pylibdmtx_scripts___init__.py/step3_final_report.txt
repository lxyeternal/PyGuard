  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval/exec, environment variables, network calls, suspicious strings, complex control flow, obscure variable names.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, environment variables, file system, system calls, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input flow into network/system calls or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious strings, complex control flow, lack of comments, obscure variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are high-risk indicators. Suspicious strings and complex control flow suggest potential malicious intent. Benign code shows straightforward logic without obfuscation. Ambiguous code has potential but no definitive malicious patterns. Scores are aligned with these observations, with high scores for obfuscation and malware in suspicious code, low in benign code, and moderate in ambiguous cases.",
  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are consistent with their analyses. Report 1's high obfuscation (0.8) and malware (0.6) scores are justified by signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution. Benign reports (2 and 3) correctly have zero malware and low risk. The ambiguous report (4) appropriately reflects moderate risk due to potential hidden malicious activity. Overall, the scoring and reasoning are appropriate and well-justified.",
