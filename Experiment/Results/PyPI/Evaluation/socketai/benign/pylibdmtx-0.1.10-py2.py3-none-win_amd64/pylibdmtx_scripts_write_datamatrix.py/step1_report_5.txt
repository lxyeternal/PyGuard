  "purpose": "Generate a DataMatrix barcode image file from input data using specified encoding parameters.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments 'file' and 'data', and optional 'size' and 'scheme' parameters.",
  "sinks": "Image file saving via im.save(args.file); encode function processing data.",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> encode data -> generate barcode -> save image file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or hidden behaviors. Usage of external libraries appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The script takes user input via command-line arguments, encodes the data into a DataMatrix barcode, and saves it as an image file. The data is UTF-8 encoded but not transmitted or stored remotely; no network activity, no credential handling, and no execution of untrusted code are present. External libraries used are standard and documented. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. The code is straightforward, intended solely for barcode generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured barcode generator without malicious intent or security risks. No signs of malware, data leaks, or malicious modifications are present.",
