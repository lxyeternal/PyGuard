  "purpose": "Unit tests for the pylibdmtx library's read and write datamatrix scripts",
  "sources": "Reads from __file__ for the test image, uses sys.stdout for capturing output",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout for output display, file system for temporary files",
  "flows": "main_read reads image files, outputs to stdout; main_write generates image files, then main_read reads back",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; use of temporary files is standard testing practice; no obfuscation or unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit testing for reading and writing DataMatrix barcode images, capturing stdout to verify outputs. It uses standard libraries and calls library functions with test data. No external network, no data exfiltration, no malicious payloads, and no suspicious behavior observed. The file operations are confined to temporary files for testing purposes. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit testing script for a barcode library, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It relies on standard testing practices and does not perform any harmful operations.",
