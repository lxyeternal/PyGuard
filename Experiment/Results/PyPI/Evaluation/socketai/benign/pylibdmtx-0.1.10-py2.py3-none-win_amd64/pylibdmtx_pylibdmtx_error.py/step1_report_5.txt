  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named PyLibDMTXError for handling specific errors related to the PyLibDMTX library or module.",
  "sources": "None, as the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None, as the code does not process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs since there are no source or sink operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward class definition with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. It contains no methods or logic beyond the class declaration, indicating it is likely used for specialized error handling within a larger codebase. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security risks present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign class definition for a custom exception, with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
