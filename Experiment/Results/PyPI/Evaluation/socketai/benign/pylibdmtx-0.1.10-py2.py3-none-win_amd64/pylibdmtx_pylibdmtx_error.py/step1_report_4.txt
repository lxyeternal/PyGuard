  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for error handling in a Python library related to DMTX (Dynamix Multi-Technology eXtensions).",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading points present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow since the code only defines an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain any suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class inheriting from Python's built-in Exception. There are no data inputs, external connections, or security-sensitive operations. The structure and content are typical for custom exception definitions and do not suggest malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign class definition for a custom exception. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
