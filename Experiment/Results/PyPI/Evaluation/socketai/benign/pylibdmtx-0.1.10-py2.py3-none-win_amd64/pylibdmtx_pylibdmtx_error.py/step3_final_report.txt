  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named PyLibDMTXError inheriting from Exception.",
  "sources": "Class definition; no data input, output, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the class is a simple exception subclass with no methods or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class definition for a custom exception, with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code's simplicity and standard pattern further support the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no security concerns or malicious intent. The reports accurately reflect this, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
