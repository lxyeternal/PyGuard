  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no executable logic, data input/output, or external interactions.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly state that the code is benign, minimal, and standard.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1 (or 1.0)\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues, the risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - The code is purely a class definition with no security implications.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and avoid assumptions, correctly stating that the code is harmless.\n   - No unwarranted claims are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate for the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a straightforward, standard custom exception class with no security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo further action needed.",
