  "purpose": "Provide functionality to read and write Data Matrix barcodes in Python.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading identified in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points identified in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks evident in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains a version string assignment with no suspicious or unusual code constructs; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is minimal, consisting solely of a descriptive comment, a version attribute, and no functional or executable code. Given its simplicity, there are no sources, sinks, or flows indicating malicious activity. The content aligns with a typical package metadata file or module-level docstring, and contains no signs of obfuscated code or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code fragment appears benign, serving as documentation or metadata for a barcode library. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are evident.",
