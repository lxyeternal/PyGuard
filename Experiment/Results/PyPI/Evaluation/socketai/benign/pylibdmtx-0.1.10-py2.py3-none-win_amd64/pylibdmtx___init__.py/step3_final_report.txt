  "purpose": "Module header and version metadata for a Data Matrix barcode processing library.",
  "sources": "None in this snippet; only a docstring and a version variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the snippet contains only static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; minimal descriptive content with no executable code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module header with a descriptive docstring and a version string. It contains no functions, classes, input/output operations, or executable logic. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The minimal nature of the snippet indicates it is benign and purely informational. The high confidence scores in the reports are justified given the lack of any suspicious elements. No data flows or vulnerabilities are present, and the code does not perform any actions that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is entirely benign, serving as a descriptive header with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify the minimal, harmless nature of this fragment. The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should be set to 0, reflecting the absence of any malicious or suspicious elements.",
