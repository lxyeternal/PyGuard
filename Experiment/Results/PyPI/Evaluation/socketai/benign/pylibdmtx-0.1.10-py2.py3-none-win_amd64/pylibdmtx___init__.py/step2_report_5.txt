  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal, benign snippet consisting solely of a docstring and a version string.\n- No input/output, data handling, or executable logic is present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), indicating strong certainty that the code is harmless.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious or suspicious elements:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is purely descriptive, with no executable parts, data flows, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.\n\n2. **Scores assigned:**\n   - Malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Claims about vulnerabilities:**\n   - The reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities, focusing on the minimal code snippet.\n   - Given the code is just metadata, this is appropriate.\n\n4. **Potential improvements:**\n   - Since the code is just a header with no executable logic, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores are correctly low.\n   - The high confidence levels are justified.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- The code snippet is entirely benign, serving as a descriptive header or module-level docstring.\n- There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent with my analysis. The scores are appropriate, and there are no indications of malicious activity or security concerns in this minimal snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is harmless, purely informational.\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.",
