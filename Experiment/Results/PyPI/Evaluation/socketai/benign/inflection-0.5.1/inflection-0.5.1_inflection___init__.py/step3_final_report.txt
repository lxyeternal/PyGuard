  "purpose": "String utility functions for inflection, pluralization, singularization, and string transformations inspired by Rails' inflector.",
  "sources": "Function parameters and internal regex pattern lists; no external data sources or untrusted input handling.",
  "sinks": "No system calls, network activity, or data leaks; purely regex and string operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows through regex substitutions and string manipulations within functions; no external sinks or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious patterns; the '_irregular' function modifies regex pattern lists in a controlled manner for irregular words.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard string transformation utilities with regex-based pattern matching. It does not execute external commands, handle untrusted data in a dangerous way, or access external systems. The regex rules are static and used solely for linguistic transformations. The '_irregular' function adjusts pattern lists but only for pattern matching, not code execution. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and serve well-defined purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard string inflection utility library with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports' assessments are accurate and justified. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
