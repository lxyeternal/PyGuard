  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the security assessments are accurate, consistent, and justified based on the code.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of string utility functions inspired by Rails' inflector.\n- It uses regex substitutions, string manipulations, and Unicode normalization.\n- No external input sources, network activity, or system commands are present.\n- The `_irregular` function modifies global pattern lists but only for pattern matching, not executing code.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated/malicious code detected.\n- The functions are straightforward and serve well-defined string processing purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis per report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** String manipulation utilities; inputs are function parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No system or network sinks; data flows only through regex and string operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; `_irregular` modifies pattern lists in a controlled manner.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n\n**Risk/Malware/Obfuscated Scores:** All zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar string utilities; operates on provided strings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks or malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious constructs; pattern modifications are controlled.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard, benign code.\n\n**Scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** String inflection functions; operates on input strings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous sinks; transformations are safe.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code; regex rules are static and benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, no malware or security risks.\n\n**Scores:** All zero, matching the assessment.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** String transformations; no external input handling beyond parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external system interaction.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; regex rules are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, safe, utility code.\n\n**Scores:** All zero, consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** String utilities; operates on parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or system sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious constructs; static regex rules.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:** All zero, matching the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity (score 0). The code is purely string manipulation with no network, system, or code execution.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified as there are no security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — The code is clear, straightforward, and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** 0 — No security risks detected.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are consistent and justified. The code is a benign, standard string utility library with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The overall security posture of this code is very high; it is safe to use in production environments as a utility module.",
