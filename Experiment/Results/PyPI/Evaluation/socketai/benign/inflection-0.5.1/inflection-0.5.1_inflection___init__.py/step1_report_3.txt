{
  "purpose": "Provide string manipulation utilities for transforming and inflecting English words, such as pluralization, singularization, camel case conversion, and more.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of untrusted input; functions operate on provided string arguments.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; functions output transformed strings based on inputs. No evidence of data leaks or malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows through functions as input strings, but there are no external data or untrusted sources being processed that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code primarily performs regex-based string transformations. No dynamic execution, no network activity, no obfuscated code. Irregular use of regex for irregular word forms is benign. No suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions for string inflection, including pluralization, singularization, camel case, humanization, transliteration, and URL parameterization. It uses regex rules and simple string manipulations. No input validation vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions do not execute external code, access the network, or handle sensitive data. The irregular word rules are hardcoded and do not pose security risks. No obfuscation or malware patterns are present. Overall, the code appears safe and benign, serving purely as a linguistic utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard string inflection utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data in a dangerous way nor contains malicious payloads.",
