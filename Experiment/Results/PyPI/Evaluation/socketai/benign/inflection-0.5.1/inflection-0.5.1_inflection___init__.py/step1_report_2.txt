{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for string manipulation, including pluralization, singularization, camelization, underscoring, humanization, and other text formatting functions, primarily for use in web development and data processing tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; all functions operate on provided string parameters or internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "The functions do not include any data sinks that could lead to data leaks or system effects; they perform string transformations only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks exists; the code processes static or input parameters without external data injection.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code appears to be a standard utility library for string manipulation, with proper normalization and pattern matching. The _irregular function dynamically inserts regex rules but only for string patterns and does not execute arbitrary code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions that manipulate strings, including regex-based transformations, transliteration, and case conversions. No external input handling beyond function parameters is present. The use of regex for pattern matching is standard, with no evidence of dynamic code execution or malicious behavior. The _irregular function modifies the global regex rules for pluralization and singularization but does so based on predefined parameters; it does not execute arbitrary code. The code is well-structured, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs. Overall, it appears to be a benign string utility library, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of string manipulation utilities for text formatting and linguistic transformations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe to use, with a very low malware and security risk score.",
