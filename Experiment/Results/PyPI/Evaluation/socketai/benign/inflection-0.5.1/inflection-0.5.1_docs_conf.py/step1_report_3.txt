  "purpose": "Configuration for building documentation using Sphinx for the 'inflection' project.",
  "sources": "Import of '__version__' from 'inflection', environment variable 'READTHEDOCS'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data output or external data transfer points present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences 'html_theme' setting; import of version info is read-only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with imports, environment checks, and setup variables. It imports the '__version__' attribute from the 'inflection' package, which is typical for versioning purposes. The environment variable 'READTHEDOCS' influences the theme selection, which is a common practice in documentation builds. No external data is read from untrusted sources, no code execution or network activity is present. The structure and content are consistent with typical documentation setup files, with no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration script for Sphinx documentation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
