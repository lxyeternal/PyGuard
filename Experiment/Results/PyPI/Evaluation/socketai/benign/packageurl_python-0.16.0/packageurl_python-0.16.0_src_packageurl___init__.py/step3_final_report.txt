  "purpose": "A utility for parsing, normalizing, and constructing Package URLs (purls) according to the purl specification.",
  "sources": "Input strings from methods like from_string, normalization functions, and class constructor parameters.",
  "sinks": "String outputs such as to_string(), data structures like dictionaries, and internal validation routines.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through normalization functions, validation routines, and into the PackageURL object, then to string serialization or dictionary export.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Validation routines are thorough but standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard URL parsing and normalization with comprehensive validation, especially on qualifiers and components. It handles both string and byte inputs, performs normalization based on package type, and constructs purl strings. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. Validation routines prevent malformed inputs, and the code structure is clear and well-documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured package URL utility with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It performs expected functions safely and robustly.",
