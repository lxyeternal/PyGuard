{
  "purpose": "A minimal Python setup script that imports setuptools and calls setup() within the main guard.",
  "sources": "The script reads no external input, environment variables, or data; it only imports a module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script simply executes a setup call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard Python packaging script with no dynamic code execution, external data processing, or suspicious behavior. It imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' under the main guard, which is typical for package distribution. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
