  "purpose": "This code is intended to define and configure a Python package setup using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading; standard import of setuptools library.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output points; setup invocation is standard.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only initializes package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The use of a shebang and encoding declaration is standard for scripts, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal setup script for a Python package. It imports setuptools and calls setup() when executed directly. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious imports, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and conforms to common package setup practices. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
