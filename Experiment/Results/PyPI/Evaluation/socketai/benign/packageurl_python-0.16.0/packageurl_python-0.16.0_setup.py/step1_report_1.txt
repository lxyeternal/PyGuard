{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, intended to configure package installation.",
  "sources": "The only source is the 'setuptools.setup()' call, which executes during the script run.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: script execution triggers 'setuptools.setup()', which performs package setup tasks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal setup configuration for Python packaging, importing 'setuptools' and executing 'setup()' if run directly. It contains no user input, data processing, or code that could be malicious. Its purpose is purely to facilitate package distribution. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident based on this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
