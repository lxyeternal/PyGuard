  "purpose": "Define a Django filter class for filtering objects based on a Package URL string, with special handling for empty values.",
  "sources": "import django_filters; class attribute definitions; __init__ method; filter method",
  "sinks": "qs.for_package_url() and qs.empty_package_url() method calls",
  "flows": "Input value to filter method -> decision branches -> qs.for_package_url() or qs.empty_package_url() calls",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; use of standard Django filtering methods",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django filter class with standard methods and attributes, including special handling for empty values. It relies on the model manager methods 'for_package_url' and 'empty_package_url', which are documented and expected to be implemented separately. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are evident. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. Its purpose is to facilitate filtering in a Django app without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a Django filter class with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It relies on model methods that should be implemented securely and correctly. Overall, this appears to be benign, standard filtering code.",
