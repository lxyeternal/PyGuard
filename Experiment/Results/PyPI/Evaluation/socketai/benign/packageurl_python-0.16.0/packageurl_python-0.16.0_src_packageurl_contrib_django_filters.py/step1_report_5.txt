  "purpose": "Define a Django filter class for filtering objects by a Package URL string, with special handling for empty URLs and exact match filtering.",
  "sources": "Import of django_filters library; usage of class attributes and methods, especially within filter() method.",
  "sinks": "qs.for_package_url() and qs.empty_package_url() method calls, which depend on the Model Manager methods.",
  "flows": "Input value from filter() method -> conditional logic to determine filter type -> calls to qs.empty_package_url() or qs.for_package_url()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; use of standard Django filtering patterns. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network operations, and no data leakage points.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django filter class that extends CharFilter, adding custom behavior for filtering by package URL. It handles special 'EMPTY' value and optional exact matching. The filter() method uses conditional logic to determine whether to return an unfiltered queryset, a queryset with empty URLs, or a filtered queryset via qs.for_package_url() method. All method calls and logic are standard for Django filters, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears to rely on external model methods (for_package_url, empty_package_url), which should be safe as long as the model methods are implemented securely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django filter class with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It performs expected filtering logic without any suspicious or malicious operations.",
