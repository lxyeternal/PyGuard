  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, external files, network data, dynamic code execution functions (exec/eval).",
  "sinks": "System commands, network sockets, file system, environment variables, system files.",
  "flows": "From sources such as environment variables or user inputs to sinks like system commands or network transmissions, potentially via obfuscated or dynamic code paths.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscation techniques, dynamic code execution (`exec()`, `eval()`), hardcoded credentials, minimal comments, incomplete code, potential data exfiltration pathways.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent but are not definitive without concrete payloads. The suspicion is primarily in Report 1, which has high obfuscation (0.7) and moderate malware suspicion (0.3). Other reports describe benign or incomplete code with no suspicious patterns, justifying low malware (0) and risk scores (~0.2). The confidence levels reflect the limited information, and the scores are consistent with the described behaviors. No false positives or overestimations are evident; assessments are cautious and aligned with best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows potential obfuscation and dynamic execution in some instances, warranting moderate suspicion, but lacks concrete malicious payloads. Overall, the dependency appears low-risk with some cautious suspicion in Report 1. The scoring is appropriate, and no significant revisions are necessary based on the provided descriptions.",
