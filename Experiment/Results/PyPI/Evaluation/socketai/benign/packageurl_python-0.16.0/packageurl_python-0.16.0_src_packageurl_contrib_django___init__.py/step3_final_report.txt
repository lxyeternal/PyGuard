  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of an open source Python dependency by analyzing provided code or descriptions for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, function parameters, external inputs, and configuration files.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system modifications, environment variable access, and data processing functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs feed into processing functions, which do not lead to suspicious network activity or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code snippets, relying on descriptions indicating standard data processing without malicious patterns. Malware scores are consistently zero, obfuscated scores are zero, and security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk. Confidence levels are high where detailed benign behavior is described. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified, and the reasoning aligns with the absence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided descriptions, the code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the lack of suspicious patterns. No modifications are necessary; the assessments are consistent and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
