  "purpose": "Convert a Go package string into a PackageURL object with type 'golang', extracting namespace, name, and version.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'go_package' string, which is read at function invocation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data beyond validation, nor does it perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Input 'go_package' -> validation check for '@' -> string partition on space for version -> split on '/' for namespace and name -> construct PackageURL object.",
  "anomalies": "Raising an exception if '@' is present; otherwise, straightforward parsing with no anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs minimal validation and parsing to convert a Go package string into a PackageURL object. It checks for '@' to prevent malformed input, splits on space to separate version, and on '/' to extract namespace and name. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The validation is standard and does not introduce security issues. The code is clear, simple, and performs its intended function without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility function with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The validation step is a standard input check. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is appropriate at 0. The code poses no security threat.",
