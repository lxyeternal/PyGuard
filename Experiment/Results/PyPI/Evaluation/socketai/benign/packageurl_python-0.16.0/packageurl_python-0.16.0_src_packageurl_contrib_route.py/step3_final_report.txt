  "purpose": "A URI routing framework that maps regex patterns to callables and invokes them based on pattern matching.",
  "sources": "Pattern matching functions, route registration methods, and dynamic invocation of endpoints (functions or classes).",
  "sinks": "Invocation of registered endpoint callables, which could execute arbitrary code if malicious endpoints are registered.",
  "flows": "Input URI string is matched against patterns; if matched, the corresponding endpoint is invoked with the URI and additional arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard pattern matching and dynamic invocation; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard URI routing system with pattern registration, resolution, and invocation. It compiles regex patterns, matches input strings, and calls user-defined functions or classes. No external network activity, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The dynamic class instantiation and callable invocation are typical for such frameworks. The only potential security concern is if malicious endpoints are registered, but this is external to the code itself. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard URI routing utility with no malicious behavior or embedded malware. The main security consideration is trusting registered endpoints, which is inherent to routing systems. The scores are appropriate and reflect minimal inherent risk.",
