{
  "purpose": "The code implements a routing system for URI patterns to callable endpoints, enabling pattern matching and execution of associated functions or classes based on URI input.",
  "sources": "The code reads pattern strings provided during route registration and incoming URI strings during resolution and processing.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the invocation of endpoint callables with the input URI and additional arguments; no other data sinks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Input URI strings are matched against route patterns; upon a match, the corresponding endpoint (function or class) is invoked with the URI and extra arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code does not perform external network requests, data exfiltration, or system modification. The use of regular expressions and dynamic class instantiation is standard for routing libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a URI routing framework that maps regex patterns to callables, and resolves URIs to execute associated functions or classes. It includes input handling through pattern matching and dynamic invocation of registered endpoints. No malicious code, such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors, is present. The dynamic instantiation of classes is standard in routing systems and does not pose a security threat without further context. The code does not process untrusted external data beyond pattern matching and function invocation, and no hardcoded secrets are detected. Overall, it functions as a routing utility with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard routing implementation that maps URI patterns to callables. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. No evidence of malware, data leaks, or sabotage present.",
