{
  "purpose": "The code provides a routing mechanism to map URI patterns to callable endpoints, enabling dynamic dispatch based on URI matching.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'string' parameter in 'process', 'resolve', and 'is_routable' methods, which are typically URI strings provided by external callers.",
  "sinks": "The external callable endpoints invoked in 'process' may process untrusted input, but the code itself does not perform any data leakage, network communication, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "Input URI strings are matched against stored rules; if a match is found, the corresponding endpoint is called with the URI and additional arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code performs standard pattern matching and dynamic invocation. No obfuscation or malicious code appears.",
  "analysis": "The code defines routing classes to match URIs with regex patterns and invoke corresponding callables. It ensures patterns match entire strings, supports decorator-based registration, and manages route conflicts through exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of regular expressions is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. The routing system relies on user-supplied patterns and endpoints, but this is standard for routing libraries and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a URI routing system with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It is a standard routing mechanism that could be used in various web or network applications. There are no suspicious behaviors, hidden backdoors, or security risks within this module.",
