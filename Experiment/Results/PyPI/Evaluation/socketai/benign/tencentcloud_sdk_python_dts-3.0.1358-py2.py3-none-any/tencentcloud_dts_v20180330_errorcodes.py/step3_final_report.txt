{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of string constants representing various error codes and messages, serving as a static reference for error handling within an SDK or API.",
  "sources": "The code reads static constant definitions; no input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process or output data dynamically.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code is purely static constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string constants defining error codes, accompanied by licensing comments. It contains no dynamic logic, input handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The constants are standard and serve as a reference for error handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or cause harm. Overall, the code is a benign, static set of error code definitions with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, static collection of error code constants with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The previous reports accurately assess its benign nature. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscated score at 0, and risk score at 0, reflecting the absence of any security threat.",
