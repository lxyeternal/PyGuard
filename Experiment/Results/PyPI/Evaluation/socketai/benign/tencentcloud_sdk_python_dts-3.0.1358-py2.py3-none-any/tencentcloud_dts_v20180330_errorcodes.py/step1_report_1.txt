{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of constant string error codes and messages for an API or SDK, likely related to Tencent's cloud services, used for handling various failure and error scenarios.",
  "sources": "Constants are defined as string assignments, not reading external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data sinks are present; the code only defines static constants.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input-output processing, or untrusted data transmissions within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code strictly consists of error code definitions with licensing comments.",
  "analysis": "The code includes licensing comments and a series of string constants representing error codes. No input handling, external data processing, or dynamic code execution occurs. The constants serve as identifiers for specific error conditions, and there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious logic. It appears to be a standard error code definitions module, typical for SDKs or API implementations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, straightforward set of constant definitions for error handling, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
