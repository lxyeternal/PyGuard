{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of constant string error codes and messages for use in error handling within a larger application or SDK, likely related to cloud services or resource management.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from predefined string constants representing various error codes, which are used throughout the system to identify specific error conditions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are places where these error codes are returned or logged, possibly affecting flow control or user feedback.",
  "flows": "The code primarily involves assigning string constants to variables; these constants may flow to logs, error handlers, or API responses in the larger system.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. The code consists solely of static constant definitions with licensing comments. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The file is a straightforward set of constant definitions for error codes, with licensing and copyright comments. It does not contain executable logic, input processing, or data flow beyond the declaration of constants. The structure is typical for error code management in SDKs or APIs, and there are no signs of malicious activity or code intended to perform harmful actions. The content is static and focused solely on error code standardization, which is common and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-malicious, standard set of error code definitions used for error handling. It does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is purely to define constants for use elsewhere in a larger application.",
