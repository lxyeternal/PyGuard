  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a static set of constant string definitions for error codes, with no dynamic or executable logic. There are no signs of code that could be malicious, obfuscated, or insecure. The code is purely declarative, serving as a reference for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies, no data flows, no input handling, and no suspicious behaviors. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature. These seem reasonable given the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since all scores are 0, there's no need to justify higher scores. The code does not pose any security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports, consistent with the code content.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they appropriately conclude that the code is standard, non-malicious, and safe.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent and reasonable, given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0**  \n- **Risk Score**: **0**  \n\nThis code is a typical constants module for error codes, with no malicious or suspicious content. The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments provided.**",
