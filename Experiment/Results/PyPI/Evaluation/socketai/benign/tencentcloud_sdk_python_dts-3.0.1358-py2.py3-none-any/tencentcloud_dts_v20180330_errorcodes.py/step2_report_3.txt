  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists solely of static string constants defining error codes and messages.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, data processing, or external data sources are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.\n- The purpose appears to be standard error code management within an SDK or API.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is straightforward, and the constants appear correctly defined. There are no errors, flaws, or mistakes in the code itself.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected. The code does not perform any operations beyond defining constants.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear, with no obfuscated patterns or suspicious constructs.\n- **Security risks:** None evident; the code is static and intended for error handling.\n\n### Logical or reasoning flaws:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are present.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clarity of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 1, which seems high given the code's benign nature. Since these are just error code constants, a risk score of 0.0 or 0.1 would be more appropriate. A score of 1 suggests a high security risk, which is unjustified here.\n\n### Justification for risk score:\n- The code does not contain any executable logic, external inputs, or dynamic behavior.\n- It is purely a set of static constants used for error handling.\n- Therefore, a risk score should be **very low**, e.g., **0.0** or **0.1**.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are generally consistent with the content, except for the risk scores, which are overestimated.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Reduce from 1 to **0.0** or **0.1** to reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the code's purpose and content, which is purely static constant definitions with no malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, non-malicious, and standard.\n- The risk score should be lowered from 1 to 0.\n- No changes needed for malware or obfuscation scores.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to prepare a formal report or further analysis.",
