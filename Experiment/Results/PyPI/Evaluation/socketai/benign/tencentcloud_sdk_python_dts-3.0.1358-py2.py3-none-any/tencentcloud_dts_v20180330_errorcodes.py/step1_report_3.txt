{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of constant string variables representing various error codes and messages for an API or SDK, likely used for error handling and standardization within a larger system.",
  "sources": "The source of data appears to be predefined error code constants; there are no input sources or data reading mechanisms present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs; the code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code, as it solely declares static string constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code structures, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code follows standard practices for defining constants and licensing information.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with licensing and copyright notices, followed by a series of constant variable assignments that map descriptive variable names to string error codes. The constants cover various error scenarios, including authorization failures, internal errors, parameter errors, resource not found errors, operation denials, request limit exceedances, and unsupported operations. There are no dynamic executions, user inputs, or external data handling. The code appears straightforward, well-structured, and standard for defining error codes, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical constants definition module for error handling, containing no malicious or suspicious content. It is unlikely to pose security risks or contain malware. The purpose is purely to standardize error codes for the system or SDK.",
