  "purpose": "The provided code appears to be part of a Python package, primarily containing metadata such as copyright, license, version, and licensing information.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the initial comments, license information, and version variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, inputs, or untrusted data processing in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of comments and a version assignment; no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code includes licensing comments, copyright notices, and a version variable. It does not contain executable logic, external input handling, or data output. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The only notable aspect is the license and copyright information, which are typical for open-source or licensed software.\n\nThere are no code execution, data leaks, or malicious behaviors present in this snippet. It appears to be a benign header or metadata section of a larger codebase.\n\nConsidering the entire content, this is a standard licensing header with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard licensing and version header with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is benign and typical for open-source projects or licensed software modules.",
