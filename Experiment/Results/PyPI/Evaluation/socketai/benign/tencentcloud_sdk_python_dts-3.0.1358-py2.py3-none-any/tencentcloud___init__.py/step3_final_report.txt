  "purpose": "This code snippet contains only licensing comments and a version string assignment, serving as metadata for the software package.",
  "sources": "Comments and the __version__ variable assignment",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no data inputs or outputs",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data processing, or suspicious constructs; only licensing info and version string",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version string, with no functions, data handling, network calls, or executable logic. This indicates it is metadata only, with no potential for malicious behavior or security risks. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, reflecting the benign nature. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the straightforward content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata with no malicious or security concerns. It is safe and standard for open-source projects, with no need for further review or modification.",
  "confidence": 1,
