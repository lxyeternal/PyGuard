  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their assessments. Slightly increasing malware scores in reports 4 and 5 from 0.4 to 0.5 and 0.2 to 0.3 respectively would better align with the suspicious features described. Overall, the code does not show confirmed malicious activity but warrants cautious scoring due to obfuscation and dynamic constructs."
