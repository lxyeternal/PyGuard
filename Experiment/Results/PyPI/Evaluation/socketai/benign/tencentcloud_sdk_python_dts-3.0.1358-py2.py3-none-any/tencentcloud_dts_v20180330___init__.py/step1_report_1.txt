  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a typical Python script performing some data processing or utility functions. No explicit malicious intent is evident from the visible code.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly shown; no functions like input(), sys.stdin, or environment variable reads are visible.",
  "sinks": "No insecure data sinks such as file writes, network connections, or system commands are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flows are identified; the code seems to perform standard operations within local scope.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious string patterns, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly, including the beginning, middle, and end sections. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities were detected. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard, and no malicious behavior, such as network communication, file manipulation, or credential theft, is apparent. The code structure is straightforward and does not exhibit any anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign, with no indicators of malware or malicious intent.",
