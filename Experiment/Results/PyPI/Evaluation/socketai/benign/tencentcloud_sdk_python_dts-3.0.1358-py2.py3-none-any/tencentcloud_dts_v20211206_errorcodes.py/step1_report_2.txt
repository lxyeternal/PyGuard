{
  "purpose": "The code defines a series of string constants representing various error codes and status messages used for API responses, primarily related to authentication, authorization, internal errors, parameter validation, resource management, and operational statuses.",
  "sources": "These constants are hardcoded string assignments within the Python module, serving as identifiers for different error conditions and operational states.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it solely defines constants without any data flow or processing logic. No untrusted data input or output handling is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are identifiable in this code snippet, as it consists solely of static constant definitions without functions, data processing, or control flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward enumeration of error code constants, with no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. No suspicious patterns, such as hidden code, backdoors, or encrypted strings, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a static reference for error code identifiers, which are common in API SDKs and error handling modules. It includes various categories of error constants, with clear and descriptive naming conventions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, system modification, or backdoors. The code's structure and content are typical for error code definitions in SDKs or API client libraries. The absence of executable logic, input/output handling, or network operations further reduces suspicion. Therefore, it appears to be benign and solely intended for reference or internal use.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign collection of error code constants used for API response handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It is a standard, safe component likely part of a larger SDK or API client library.",
