{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of string constants representing various error codes and status messages used in a Tencent cloud SDK or API for handling different error scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code contains hardcoded string constants assigned to variables, primarily for error code identifiers.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent data sinks that process untrusted data; the code only declares static constants.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow or untrusted data processing occurs; the code is static and does not involve input or output flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code is highly static with numerous string constants; no obfuscation, no dynamic execution, and no hidden or suspicious code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward declaration of constants representing error codes, which are likely used elsewhere in the application for error handling. There are no functions, input/output handling, or data processing logic. The presence of license headers and structured error code definitions is typical for SDKs or APIs. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are present. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a software development kit or client library, with no indication of sabotage or malware. Its simplicity and static nature suggest low security risk and no malware suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists solely of static error code declarations, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is a standard SDK component for error handling, posing minimal security risk.",
