  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a static list of string constants representing error codes and messages used for error handling in an SDK or API context. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic logic. The code is purely declarative.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Elements**  \nNo report mentions any signs of obfuscation, hidden code, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code contains no secrets, no encrypted strings, and no suspicious patterns. The license header and naming conventions are consistent with standard SDK error code modules.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Anomalies**  \nThe reports uniformly state that the code is straightforward, static, and typical for error code definitions. There are no anomalies, unusual code structures, or signs of sabotage.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.  \n- **Security Risk & Risk Scores:** Both are 0, consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports are cautious and base their conclusions on the static, non-executable nature of the code, which is appropriate. No unwarranted assumptions are made about malicious intent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \nThe code is a benign, static set of error code constants with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward constants)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk; purely static definitions)\n\n**Final Justification:**  \nThe code is a standard error code constants module, typical in SDKs or API client libraries, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and has no security concerns. The existing reports are accurate and comprehensive.",
