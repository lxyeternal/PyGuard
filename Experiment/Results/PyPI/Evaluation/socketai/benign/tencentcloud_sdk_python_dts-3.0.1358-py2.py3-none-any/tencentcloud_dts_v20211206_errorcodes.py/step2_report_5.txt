  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is purely a static list of string constants representing error codes. There are no functions, data processing, or dynamic behaviors. No untrusted data, network operations, or obfuscation are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is a benign constants module, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. No logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code. These scores are reasonable and appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely static constants with no dynamic or executable content, a high risk score is unwarranted. The current scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. No malicious behavior is indicated or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the static, transparent nature of the code. They correctly interpret the constants as part of an SDK or API error handling module.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis—no suspicion or malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0**  \n- **Risk Score**: **0**  \n\n**Rationale**: The code is a standard, static error code constants module with no dynamic or suspicious elements. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nBased on all evidence, I agree with the current assessments. The code is benign, safe, and standard for error handling in SDKs or APIs. No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and reasoning provided.",
