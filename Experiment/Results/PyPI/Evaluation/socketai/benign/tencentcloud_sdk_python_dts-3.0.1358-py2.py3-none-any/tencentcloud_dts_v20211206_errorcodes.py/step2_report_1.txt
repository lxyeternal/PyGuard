  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate the reports and the provided code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is purely a static list of string constants representing error codes and messages.\n   - No dynamic logic, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - No signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n\n2. **Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is a set of constant definitions for error handling.\n   - They consistently note the absence of data flows, sinks, or dynamic behavior.\n   - No incorrect assumptions or reasoning are evident; all reports correctly interpret the static nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Issues:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, aligning with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification:**\n   - The code contains only static error code constants; no executable logic or external data handling.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.\n   - The consistent, straightforward nature of the code supports a malware score of 0.\n   - The risk score is also 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or exploitable issues.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are grounded in observable facts; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n   - The analysis correctly dismisses any suspicion of malicious intent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - All scores are consistent with the code's content and the analysis.\n   - The high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores are justified.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no vulnerabilities or security risks identified)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is a benign, static constants module for error handling in an SDK or API client. It is standard practice, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed. The code is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
