{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of string constants representing error codes and messages used for error handling in a Tencent cloud SDK or API client, facilitating standardized error reporting.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it consists solely of static string constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code is purely static.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code does not process or transmit data dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static collection of string constants for error codes, with no functions, data processing, or external interactions. It contains no secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or vulnerabilities. The static, transparent structure supports a high confidence in benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static constants module for error handling, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing reports are accurate, and the scores are consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
