{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of constant string error codes and messages, likely used for handling and reporting errors within a larger software system, possibly an SDK or API client for Tencent cloud services.",
  "sources": "The source code does not read input or data; it only defines constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code as it does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving sources and sinks; the code solely declares constants without dynamic execution or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and consists solely of constant definitions; no unusual code structures, obfuscation, or hidden behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The file contains license headers and a comprehensive list of error code constants related to authorization, internal errors, parameter issues, resource management, and operation restrictions. No dynamic code, input handling, or execution logic is present. The structure and content are typical for an error code module, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. The absence of any code that performs network requests, data processing, or system modifications suggests this is a benign, static constants definition file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard constants definition module for error handling in a cloud SDK or API client. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger, well-defined codebase.",
