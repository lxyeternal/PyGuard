{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of string constants representing various error codes and messages related to authentication, internal errors, parameter issues, resource management, and operation permissions, likely used for error handling and reporting in a cloud or API SDK.",
  "sources": "The source is the static list of constant definitions, specifically string assignments representing error codes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present; the code only defines constants.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows, input/output processing, or data handling logic present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is solely a list of constant definitions with no dynamic or unusual code constructs; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists purely of static constant definitions for error codes and messages, typical for SDKs or API client libraries. There are no functions, data processing, external interactions, or code injection mechanisms. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or backdoors are evident. The content appears to be a standard error code mapping module, with consistent naming conventions and no anomalies or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard constants module for error handling, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain any behavior that could be malicious or sabotage-related. Its purpose is to facilitate error reporting within a larger system.",
