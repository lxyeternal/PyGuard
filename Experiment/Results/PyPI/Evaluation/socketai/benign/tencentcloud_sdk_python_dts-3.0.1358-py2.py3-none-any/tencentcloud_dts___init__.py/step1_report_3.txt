  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, potentially for data processing or utility functions, but there is no explicit comment or documentation indicating its purpose.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, imported modules, and any file or network input if present (none explicitly shown in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be system calls, network requests, file writes, or database interactions if present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment variables, inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs, external calls). No explicit flow can be confirmed due to the absence of actual code logic in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected due to lack of code. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present in the provided code segment.",
  "analysis": "The analysis is limited as the code is not provided; the prompt contains no actual code to review. Without code, I cannot identify sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there are no observable malicious behaviors or security risks. The code appears benign or simply not provided.",
