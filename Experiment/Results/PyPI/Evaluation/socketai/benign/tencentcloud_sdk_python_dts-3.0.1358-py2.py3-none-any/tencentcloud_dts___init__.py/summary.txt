  "conclusion": "Most reports appropriately assign low or zero scores due to lack of code. Report 4's high scores are overstated without actual code evidence and should be lowered. The overall assessment confirms the scoring is reasonable, with adjustments needed only for speculative claims. Final scores should reflect the certainty level, with high suspicion only when concrete malicious patterns are confirmed."
