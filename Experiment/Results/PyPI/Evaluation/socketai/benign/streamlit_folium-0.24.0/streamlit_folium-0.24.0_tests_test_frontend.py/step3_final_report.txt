{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for a Streamlit application, utilizing Playwright for UI interaction testing and subprocess to run the app locally during tests.",
  "sources": "Reads user interactions, page responses, and subprocess commands to launch the app.",
  "sinks": "Potential subprocess execution and response handling; no external data leaks or malicious data flows.",
  "flows": "UI actions trigger responses; subprocess call initiates the app; no untrusted data influences subprocess parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Subprocess management is standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, standard testing suite for a web app, with subprocess calls to run the app in a controlled environment. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious external connections are present. The subprocess invocation is static and does not process untrusted input. Response handlers and UI interactions are typical for automated tests. The overall logic is straightforward, with no anomalies indicating sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign testing script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (around 0.1 to 0.2), justified by the subprocess call which is standard in testing environments. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and integrity.",
