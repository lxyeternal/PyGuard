  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; the code is a test suite for a Streamlit app using Playwright.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows; primarily UI interactions and response handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. Subprocess handling is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct; no malicious intent detected.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — justified.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.\n- Risk: 0.1 — low, given the standard testing setup.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable scores. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above; a test suite with standard interactions.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk: 0.1 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sinks:** Standard subprocess call to run the app, with screenshot captures.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious code; subprocess is controlled and standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — justified.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.\n- Risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sinks:** Similar pattern; subprocess for launching the app, with response handlers.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious activity; subprocess is a typical pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — justified.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.\n- Risk: 0.1 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sinks:** The subprocess call to 'streamlit run' is a critical sink.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** The subprocess invocation is straightforward, with no untrusted input influencing command parameters.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is correct; the code is a standard test harness.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 — justified.\n- Obfuscated: 0 — justified.\n- Risk: 0.2 — slightly higher but still low; justified given the subprocess call, but it’s a common pattern in testing.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard testing suite with no malicious intent.\n- The scores for malware and obfuscated are consistently 0, which is appropriate.\n- The risk scores are low, reflecting the controlled testing environment without external data leaks or malicious payloads.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, since no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are detected.\n- **Risk score:** Generally 0.1–0.2, justified by the subprocess calls and testing context, but no significant security risk exists.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 — 0.2, depending on the interpretation of subprocess use, but still very low.\n\nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
