  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign testing script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is low (around 0.1 to 0.2), justified by the subprocess call which is standard in testing environments. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and integrity."
