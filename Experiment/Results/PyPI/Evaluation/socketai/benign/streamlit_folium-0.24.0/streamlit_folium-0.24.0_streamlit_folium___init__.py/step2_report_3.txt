  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of malicious code, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a standard implementation for embedding Folium maps into Streamlit, with no suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code. It notes the use of standard libraries (d3.js), and the hashing function is used for cache/identification, not malicious purposes.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both are scored as 0, consistent with the report's conclusion.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1, which is low, aligning with the high confidence (0.95) that the code is safe.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a typical map rendering utility with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code handles rendering Folium maps, generating leaflet code, and injecting scripts, all standard practices. No evidence of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both are 0, which is reasonable.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2, slightly higher but still low, justified by the standard nature of the code.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The external libraries and code patterns are typical for such applications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is for embedding Folium maps, generating HTML/JS, and managing interactions. It manipulates JS strings, loads external libraries, and handles dynamic content. No malicious patterns or suspicious activity detected.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both 0, with a slight 0.2 obfuscation score, possibly due to string manipulations but not malicious.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2, consistent with the low likelihood of malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns well with the code's purpose. String manipulations are standard for dynamic map rendering.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code's role in rendering maps, generating scripts, and managing map components. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code. The code is a utility for visualization.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both 0, with obfuscation at 0.2 possibly due to regex and string replacements.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2, consistent with the overall low risk.\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is reasonable; no malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, describing the code as a utility for rendering maps, managing dependencies, and generating code snippets. No signs of malicious activity or backdoors.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** Both 0, with obfuscation at 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1, very low.\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify actual vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation that would raise concern. The code is a typical map rendering utility, relying on standard libraries and practices.\n\n- **Obfuscation & Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0 to malware and obfuscation, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** The low risk scores (0.1-0.2) are justified given the nature of the code.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:** The only minor point is the use of regex and string replacements, which could be viewed as a form of obfuscation, but this is standard for dynamic JS code generation and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on this review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation beyond standard string manipulation)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard code for map rendering)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent. The existing scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard implementation for embedding Folium maps into Streamlit applications. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low risk scores are justified, and I concur with the assessments provided.",
