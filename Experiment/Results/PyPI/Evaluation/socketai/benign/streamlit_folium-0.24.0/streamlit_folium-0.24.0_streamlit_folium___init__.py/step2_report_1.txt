  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes functions for embedding Folium maps into Streamlit, extracting HTML/JS, and handling interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets. External scripts are standard (d3.js). No obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is well-structured, standard for Folium + Streamlit integration. No malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage signs. Hashing functions are used for cache or identification, not malicious purposes.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (very low). Confidence high (0.95).\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are reasonable; the code is safe, with negligible security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, focusing on rendering Folium maps, generating leaflet JS, handling dual maps, feature groups, and external libraries.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials or malicious code. External libraries (d3.js) are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent; the code is a standard map rendering utility. External resources are common.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0.2 (slight), securityRisk=0.2. Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The obfuscated score is slightly above zero, but given the code's nature, some string manipulations are normal. Overall, no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Embedding Folium maps, generating HTML/JS, managing interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No credentials or suspicious code. External JS libraries are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; the code is typical for map visualization. External resources are standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, securityRisk=0.2. Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The obfuscated score is marginal, likely due to string manipulations, but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Rendering Folium maps, generating leaflet code, managing controls.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns. Uses regex for string replacements, which is common.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity. The code is a utility for map rendering.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are appropriate; no malware or obfuscation detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, focusing on rendering maps, managing dependencies.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code. Uses standard external libraries.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.2), likely due to string manipulations and regex replacements, which are common in map code generation. No evidence of code obfuscation for malicious purposes.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Very low (0.1–0.2), consistent with the analysis that the code is a standard visualization utility.\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.1 — minor string manipulation, not malicious obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation for embedding Folium maps into Streamlit. No indicators of supply chain compromise, malicious behavior, or obfuscation for malicious intent are present.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain the current low scores, but monitor for any future obfuscation or external dependencies that could change the risk profile.",
