{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to embed Folium maps into Streamlit applications, generate HTML/JavaScript representations, and manage interactions and controls for geospatial visualizations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from folium.Map or folium.Figure objects, external JS libraries (d3.js), and dynamically generated HTML/JS strings.",
  "sinks": "Generates HTML/JS code that is injected into the Streamlit frontend; manipulates DOM IDs and map components for rendering.",
  "flows": "Source data (map objects) -> HTML/JS string generation -> DOM element IDs and scripts -> Streamlit component rendering and interaction callbacks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected. Regex and string manipulations are standard for dynamic JS code generation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for embedding Folium maps into Streamlit, with functions for rendering, generating leaflet scripts, and managing map components. External libraries like d3.js are used for visualization, and no network activity or data exfiltration is present. String manipulations and regex are typical for dynamic code generation and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The hashing function is used for cache or identification purposes, not malicious purposes. No backdoors, suspicious network calls, or sabotage signs are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for rendering Folium maps within Streamlit applications. No indicators of supply chain compromise, malicious behavior, or obfuscation for malicious intent are present. The security risk is very low, and the malware and obfuscation scores are justified as zero or near-zero.",
