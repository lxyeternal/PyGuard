  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes the code as functions to embed Folium maps into Streamlit, with proper handling of HTML/JS strings, interaction callbacks, and external scripts.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious code detected. External scripts are standard libraries (d3.js). The hashing function is used for cache or identification, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The assessment correctly identifies the code as a standard, well-structured implementation for map rendering, with no signs of malware or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. These seem reasonable given the thorough review.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Also describes map rendering, code generation, and embedding. Highlights external JS libraries and dynamic code creation.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns. External libraries are standard. The code manipulates DOM IDs and generates scripts but nothing suspicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The review correctly states the code is for rendering maps, with no malicious intent, emphasizing that external libraries are standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, securityRisk=0.2. Slightly higher obfuscated score (0.2) due to string manipulations, but still reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious activity; scores acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to previous, focusing on map embedding, HTML/JS generation, and interaction handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns. External JS libraries are standard. The code manipulates leaflet JS code but nothing malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately identifies the code as a safe utility for map rendering, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, securityRisk=0.2. These are consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Again, about rendering maps, generating scripts, managing controls, and session state.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code. Regex patterns are used legitimately. Warnings about deprecation are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is for map rendering, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. Slightly higher securityRisk but acceptable given the dynamic code generation.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Consistent with previous; focuses on rendering, code generation, and interaction.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns or backdoors. External libraries are standard. No suspicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately describes the code as legitimate for map rendering, with no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Correct.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or suspicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** Slight string manipulations are standard; no obfuscated code or malware.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, given the nature of the code and external dependencies.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-maintained utility for rendering Folium maps in Streamlit.\n- No signs of supply chain security issues, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.1 (slight string manipulation, but not malicious)\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (standard external dependencies, no malicious activity)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, with no malicious or obfuscated components. The supply chain risk is minimal.",
