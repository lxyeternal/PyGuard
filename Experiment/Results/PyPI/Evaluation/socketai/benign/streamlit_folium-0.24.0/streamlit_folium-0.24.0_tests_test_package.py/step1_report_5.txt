{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test functions for verifying the rendering and feature addition of Folium map components within a Streamlit application.",
  "sources": "The code reads imported modules (folium, streamlit_folium, folium.plugins) and internal function calls (_get_map_string, _get_feature_group_string). It does not read external user input or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or send data externally. It calls functions that generate map rendering strings, but these are internal and not used for data exfiltration or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "The tests generate maps, manipulate features, and verify that specific strings (JavaScript code snippets) are present in the generated output, verifying map rendering and plugin integration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The code solely performs map rendering tests with standard folium and streamlit_folium functions.",
  "analysis": "The script consists of multiple test functions that instantiate folium maps, add controls or plugins, and verify the generated JavaScript map representations. All imports are from known libraries, and the functions appear to test for expected behavior without any malicious logic. No external data sources, environment variables, or network communications are involved. The code's structure and content are typical for unit tests of map rendering components. There are no signs of obfuscated code or hidden malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of tests for map rendering features using folium and streamlit_folium. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is safe and primarily intended for validation of map features.",
