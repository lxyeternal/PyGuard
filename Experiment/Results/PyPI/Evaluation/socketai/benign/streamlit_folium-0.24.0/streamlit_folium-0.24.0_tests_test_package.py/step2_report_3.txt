  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Tests for folium + streamlit_folium, no external inputs.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Assertions check for specific JavaScript snippets in generated strings.  \n- **Anomalies:** None detected; straightforward tests.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscation. The code is a benign test suite verifying correct rendering.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5 (default low risk for test code).  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, with focus on map controls and plugins.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Again, no signs of malicious activity, just verification of output strings.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Focuses on creating maps, feature groups, and verifying JavaScript snippets.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior, external data, or malicious code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Tests various map features, including dual maps and vector grids.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All standard, with no signs of malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Verifies rendering and feature addition, no external inputs or malicious code.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard testing code.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.5.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content & Behavior:** All reports describe benign, standard test functions for verifying map rendering, controls, plugins, and features using folium and streamlit_folium.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Security Risks:** The code is purely for testing and does not handle external inputs, secrets, or perform network operations.  \n- **Scores Justification:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.  \n  - **Risk:** 0.5 — standard low risk for test code, but not entirely risk-free; nonetheless, no active security concern.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Keep at 0, as no malicious activity is evident.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is clear.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.5 is appropriate, reflecting minimal inherent risk in test code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe entire set of reports describes safe, standard testing functions for a mapping library. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n---\n\n**Final Estimated Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.5\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more conservative or aggressive assessment, but based on the provided information, these scores are justified.",
