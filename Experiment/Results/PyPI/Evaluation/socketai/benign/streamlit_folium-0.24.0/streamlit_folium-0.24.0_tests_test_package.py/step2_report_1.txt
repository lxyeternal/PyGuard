  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Purpose:**\n   - The code is a suite of test functions verifying the rendering of Folium maps within Streamlit via the `streamlit_folium` library.\n   - It creates various map objects, adds controls/plugins, renders them, and asserts the presence of specific JavaScript snippets in the generated strings.\n   - The operations are straightforward, involving map creation, plugin addition, rendering, and string assertions.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Activity or Security Risks:**\n   - The code does not perform any network operations, external data fetching, or file I/O.\n   - There are no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - No dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n   - The assertions are simple string checks on the generated JavaScript code, which is typical for testing visualization outputs.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, primarily testing map rendering and features.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are identified.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1.0), and the malware/obfuscated scores are 0.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is a standard test suite with no security risks.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation present.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk or supply chain attack evident.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The code relies on standard libraries and functions, with no external untrusted input.\n   - The string assertions verify the correctness of generated code, not malicious payloads.\n   - No indication of supply chain compromise or malicious code injection.\n\n6. **Final Assessment:**\n   - Based on the provided code and reports, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n   - The code is a benign test suite verifying map rendering features.\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code appears entirely safe, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It functions as intended for testing purposes without any suspicious elements.",
