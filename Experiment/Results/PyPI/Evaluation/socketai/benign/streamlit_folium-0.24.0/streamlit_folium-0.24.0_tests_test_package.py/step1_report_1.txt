{
  "purpose": "This code provides test functions for a Python library that integrates Folium maps with Streamlit, verifying rendering and feature addition.",
  "sources": "User-imported modules (folium, streamlit_folium, folium.plugins), functions within the test functions, and map object methods.",
  "sinks": "Assertions that verify the generated map strings contain specific JavaScript code snippets, which are indirectly outputs of the map rendering process.",
  "flows": "Input data (map configurations, plugins, controls) flows into map object methods, which then produce HTML/JavaScript strings checked by assertions to ensure correct map rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. The code primarily tests output content and does not perform any suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and specialized mapping libraries, creates map objects, adds controls or plugins, renders them, and asserts the presence of specific JavaScript snippets in the output. These operations are typical for testing visualization outputs. No evidence of data exfiltration, malicious control flow, or obfuscated code. The assertions are straightforward checks for expected strings in generated HTML/JavaScript, indicating a focus on correctness verification rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of tests for a mapping library integration, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. All operations are standard and geared toward validation of expected outputs. No malware, secret leaks, or malicious intent detected.",
