  "purpose": "The code comprises a suite of unit tests verifying the rendering and features of Folium maps within Streamlit, including controls, plugins, and map components.",
  "sources": "Map creation functions, plugin additions, and rendering functions within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "Assertions checking for specific JavaScript snippets in generated map strings; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Map objects are created and rendered; the generated JavaScript strings are checked for expected code snippets; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious or unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for verifying Folium map rendering and plugin integration within Streamlit. It involves creating map objects, adding controls/plugins, rendering, and asserting the presence of specific JavaScript snippets. There are no external inputs, network activities, or malicious code. The assertions are simple string checks, typical for testing visualization outputs. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The code is benign and intended solely for validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for map rendering features with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a minimal security risk score appropriate for test code. No modifications are necessary.",
