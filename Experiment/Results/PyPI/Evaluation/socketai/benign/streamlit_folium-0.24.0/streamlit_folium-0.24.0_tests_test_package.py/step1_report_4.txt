{
  "purpose": "The provided code consists of multiple test functions designed to verify the functionality and rendering of map components using the folium library and streamlit_folium integration.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported libraries (folium, streamlit_folium, folium.plugins) and local variables (maps, feature groups). No external input sources are explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "Generated HTML/JavaScript strings via _get_map_string, generate_leaflet_string, and _get_feature_group_string functions, which produce map rendering scripts.",
  "flows": "The code creates map objects, renders them, and extracts their string representations to verify specific map components and JavaScript code snippets.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. The code only performs standard testing of map rendering functions. All functions appear to generate standard folium map scripts without malicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of test functions for verifying folium and streamlit_folium map components, including map rendering, layer controls, drawing support, feature groups, dual maps, and vector grids. The functions import relevant modules, create map instances, invoke render or add_to methods, and extract map scripts to verify expected JavaScript snippets. There is no indication of data leakage, network communication, or malicious code injection. The functions are straightforward tests and do not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior. No use of untrusted inputs, external data sources, or obfuscated code was identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite verifying the rendering and features of folium maps with streamlit integration. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or malware. The code appears safe and purely for testing purposes.",
