{
  "purpose": "The provided code is a set of test functions for the 'streamlit_folium' package, which interfaces with the 'folium' library to generate and manipulate interactive maps within Streamlit applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads local modules ('folium', 'streamlit_folium') and imports functions from them. It does not read external untrusted input or data streams.",
  "sinks": "Assertions are made on strings generated by '_get_map_string', 'generate_leaflet_string', and other functions, which produce JavaScript code for map rendering. No data is sent over the network or written to files. No sensitive data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "The code calls map rendering functions, then inspects the generated JavaScript strings to verify the presence of expected code snippets, indicating the flow from map object creation to string generation and verification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code strictly performs tests on expected map rendering outputs, with no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious injections.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises test functions that create folium map objects, add various layers or plugins, and then generate JavaScript code strings representing the maps. It asserts the presence of specific JavaScript snippets, ensuring the correctness of map rendering. There are no network connections, file writes, or execution of untrusted code. The functions are well-contained and serve to verify map rendering logic. No anomalies, malicious code, or obfuscation are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of benign tests for a mapping library integration. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It verifies the correctness of generated map scripts but does not perform any suspicious or harmful operations.",
