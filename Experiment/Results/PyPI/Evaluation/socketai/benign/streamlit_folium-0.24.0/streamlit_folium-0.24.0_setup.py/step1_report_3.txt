  "flows": "N/A (no data flow from sources to sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration options. No code execution, external data reading, or dynamic behaviors are present. The dependencies listed are common Python packages for a web mapping project, with version constraints that are typical for stability and compatibility. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package without any signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
