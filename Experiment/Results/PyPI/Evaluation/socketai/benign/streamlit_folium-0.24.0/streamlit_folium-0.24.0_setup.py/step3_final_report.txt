  "purpose": "Define package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery for a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata and dependency specifications; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; the code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is a standard setup script with clear structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setuptools setup configuration defining package name, version, author info, description, URL, packages, dependencies, and Python version requirements. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, network activity, or obfuscated patterns. All dependencies are common open-source packages. The code is static, well-structured, and follows best practices. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. The code's simplicity and transparency indicate a benign intent. The absence of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code, combined with the lack of dynamic or network operations, supports a conclusion of no security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is a standard, benign package configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. All scores are consistent with this assessment.",
