{
  "purpose": "This code configures the setup process for a Python package named 'streamlit_folium', specifying its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all data is hardcoded in the setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or exposed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no source-to-sink data flows; the script only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; the code is straightforward package setup instructions.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery. It does not contain dynamic code execution, input handling, or network operations. The dependencies are common Python packages for rendering maps in Streamlit and do not indicate malicious intent. The structure follows standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
