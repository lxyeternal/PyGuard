{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'streamlit_folium' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "setuptools.setup() call, string literals for package metadata and dependencies",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or code execution vulnerabilities",
  "flows": "Data flows from static package metadata and dependency specifications, no untrusted input handling",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; standard setup script",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata and dependencies using setuptools, with no dynamic code execution or user input. The dependencies specified appear legitimate and related to the package's functionality. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present. The structure follows standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package without any malicious behavior or security risks identified. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies.",
