{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'streamlit_folium' Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "setuptools.setup() call, including package metadata and requirements list",
  "sinks": "Installation of dependencies, package data inclusion",
  "flows": "Reading package metadata and dependencies, then installing specified packages",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. Dependencies are common open-source packages with specified version constraints.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata, dependencies, and package data. It specifies dependencies with version constraints to ensure compatibility. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The dependencies listed are standard libraries used in many projects, and no input or untrusted data is processed at runtime. The code structure follows typical Python packaging conventions without any anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only defines package metadata and dependencies in a standard manner.",
