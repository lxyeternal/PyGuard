{
  "purpose": "The function 'test_release' verifies that the '_RELEASE' variable from the 'streamlit_folium' package is set to a truthy value, likely as a check to ensure the package is not in development mode.",
  "sources": "The code imports '_RELEASE' from the 'streamlit_folium' module.",
  "sinks": "The assertion could potentially be a sink if '_RELEASE' is manipulated or influenced by untrusted sources, but in this context, it's a check of a package variable; no direct data leak or system effect is present.",
  "flows": "Importing '_RELEASE' from the package and asserting its value forms the main flow; no external data or untrusted input flows into or out of the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for a testing scenario.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a package variable '_RELEASE' and asserts its truthiness. This is a typical test to ensure a certain configuration or release state is correctly set. There are no indications of malicious intent, no dynamic code execution, no data exfiltration, or suspicious operations. The purpose appears to be a simple sanity check during testing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign test assertion to confirm the package is in the correct release state after local testing. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
