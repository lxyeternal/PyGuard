  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n```python\ndef test_release():\n    from streamlit_folium import _RELEASE\n\n    assert _RELEASE, \"Release needs to be set to True after finished testing locally\"\n```\n\n- The code imports `_RELEASE` from `streamlit_folium` and asserts it is truthy.\n- `_RELEASE` appears to be a variable indicating whether the package is in a release state.\n- The code is a straightforward test, with no data manipulation, external inputs, or network activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- Using a private variable `_RELEASE` is common in internal package states; it does not necessarily imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No, the code is simple and performs a basic check.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None. The code is benign.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **External data or code injection:** No.\n- **Suspicious patterns:** No.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 — no security concerns.\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The reports uniformly describe this as a standard testing pattern.\n- No report suggests any suspicious or malicious activity.\n- The use of `_RELEASE` as a private variable is typical for internal package states.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- **Use of a private variable:** While not inherently risky, in some contexts, importing private variables could be considered a minor design concern. However, in testing, this is common and not security-related.\n- **Assertion failure:** If `_RELEASE` is false, the assertion will raise an error, but this is expected behavior during testing, not an attack vector.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code and reports do not indicate any security issue.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (a minimal security risk due to importing a private variable, but not significant)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a simple, benign test for a release flag, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores in the reports are appropriate, and I agree with their conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The code is safe and standard for such testing purposes.",
