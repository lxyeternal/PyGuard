  "purpose": "Test function to verify the _RELEASE flag in streamlit_folium package",
  "sources": "Importing _RELEASE from streamlit_folium",
  "sinks": "Assertion statement that checks the value of _RELEASE",
  "flows": "Import _RELEASE -> assert _RELEASE",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports a variable _RELEASE from the streamlit_folium package and asserts that it is set to True, indicating a release state after local testing. This is a simple test function with no external inputs or data manipulation. No malicious patterns, code injection, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of an assertion to check a release flag is standard practice for testing and does not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test function that verifies the _RELEASE flag. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The purpose is to ensure proper release state during local testing.",
