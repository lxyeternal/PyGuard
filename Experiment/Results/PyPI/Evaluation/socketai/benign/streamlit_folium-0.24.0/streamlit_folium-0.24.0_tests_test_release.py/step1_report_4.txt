  "purpose": "The code tests whether the '_RELEASE' variable in the 'streamlit_folium' package is set correctly after local testing.",
  "sources": "The code imports '_RELEASE' from 'streamlit_folium'.",
  "sinks": "The code only performs an assertion; no data is transmitted or stored externally.",
  "flows": "Imports '_RELEASE' then checks its truthiness; no data flows beyond this point.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The function imports a variable '_RELEASE' and asserts its truthiness. This appears to be a simple test to ensure that the release flag is correctly set after local testing. There are no external network connections, data leaks, or malicious code present. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns. It is likely part of a testing routine within the package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test function verifying a release flag and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It poses no security risk.",
