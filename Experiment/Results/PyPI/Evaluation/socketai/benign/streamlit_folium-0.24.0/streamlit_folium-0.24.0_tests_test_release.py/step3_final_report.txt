  "flows": "Import _RELEASE -> assert _RELEASE",
  "anomalies": "Use of a private variable _RELEASE in a test assertion; no malicious or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a private variable _RELEASE from the streamlit_folium package and asserts it is truthy, indicating a release state. The code is straightforward, with no external inputs, network activity, or data manipulation. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The use of a private variable in this context is standard for internal package state checks. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident, and the assertion is a common testing practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple internal check for release status. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The use of a private variable _RELEASE in this context does not pose a security concern.",
