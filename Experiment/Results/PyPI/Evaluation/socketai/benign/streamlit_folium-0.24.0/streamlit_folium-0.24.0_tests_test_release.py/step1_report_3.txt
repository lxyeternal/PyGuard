  "purpose": "The function tests whether the _RELEASE variable from the streamlit_folium package is set to True, indicating a release build.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from streamlit_folium import _RELEASE",
  "sinks": "Assertion statement: assert _RELEASE",
  "flows": "Import _RELEASE from the package -> assert _RELEASE",
  "anomalies": "Use of a private variable _RELEASE, which might be intended for internal use; no other anomalies present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a private variable _RELEASE from an external package and asserts that it is set to True. This suggests the code is meant to verify the release status of the package, likely during testing or deployment. The assertion enforces that _RELEASE must be True, which is typical for ensuring a production-ready state. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful behaviors. The use of a private variable is common in internal package states and does not pose a security risk. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple test to verify the release state of an external package. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks detected. It is a standard check and does not raise security concerns.",
