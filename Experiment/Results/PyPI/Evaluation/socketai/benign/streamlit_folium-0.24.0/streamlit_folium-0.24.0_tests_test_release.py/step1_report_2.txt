{
  "purpose": "The function `test_release` appears to be a test that checks whether the `_RELEASE` variable from the `streamlit_folium` package is set to True, likely to verify that the package is in a release state after local testing.",
  "sources": "The code reads the `_RELEASE` attribute from the `streamlit_folium` package.",
  "sinks": "The assertion checks the value of `_RELEASE`, which if false, raises an AssertionError; no untrusted data flow or data leakage occurs.",
  "flows": "The code imports `_RELEASE` and then asserts its truthiness; data flow is straightforward from import to assertion, with no external inputs or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple test function that imports a specific variable from a package and asserts its value. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs a basic check that is common in development workflows to ensure release mode status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test function to verify the release status of the `streamlit_folium` package. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
