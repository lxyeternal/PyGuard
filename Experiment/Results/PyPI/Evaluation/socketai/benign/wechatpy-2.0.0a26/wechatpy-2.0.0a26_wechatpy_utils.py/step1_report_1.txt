  "purpose": "Utility functions for data handling, signature verification, timezone management, and random string generation within the WeChat SDK.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include method parameters: token, signature, timestamp, nonce, session_key, raw_data, client_signature, and any data passed to add_data(). Data can also originate from external libraries like 'pytz' or 'dateutil'.",
  "sinks": "Hash computations (hashlib.sha1), data encoding/decoding, exceptions (InvalidSignatureException), timezone imports, and random string generation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are combined and hashed for signature verification; data is encoded/decoded for processing; timezone libraries are conditionally imported based on availability; random_string generates a random sequence from allowed characters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or backdoors. Usage of common libraries and straightforward signature verification. The random_string function uses 'random.sample' which is appropriate, though it may not be cryptographically secure, but not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for handling signatures, encoding conversions, timezone retrieval, and random string generation. Signature verification functions compare hashes of concatenated data, which is standard practice. The timezone function conditionally imports modules, which is normal, and handles import failures gracefully. Random string generation uses 'random.sample', which is sufficient for non-security-critical random strings but not for cryptographically secure tokens. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No external network communication or system manipulation observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for signature verification, data encoding, timezone management, and random string creation, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It operates within expected parameters for such utilities.",
