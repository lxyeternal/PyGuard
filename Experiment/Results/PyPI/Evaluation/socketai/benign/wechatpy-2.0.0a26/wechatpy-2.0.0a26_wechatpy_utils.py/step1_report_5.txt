{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for data signing, signature verification, encoding conversions, timezone retrieval, and random string generation for WeChat integrations.",
  "sources": "User inputs or external data such as token, signature, timestamp, nonce, session_key, raw_data, client_signature, and timezone string.",
  "sinks": "Signature verification functions raise exceptions on invalid signatures; encoding functions return strings or bytes; timezone functions import external modules; random_string generates a random string.",
  "flows": "Input data (token, raw_data, session_key, etc.) -> encoding/decoding functions -> hashing/signature functions -> exception if verification fails.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs standard cryptographic and data handling tasks without hidden or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code implements utility functions related to data signing, signature verification, encoding conversions, timezone retrieval, and random string generation. Signature verification raises exceptions if checks fail, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. External imports are conditional and safe. Random string generation uses standard library functions without unusual patterns. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate utility functions for WeChat integration without malicious intent. No signs of malware, malicious backdoors, or security risks are evident. It is safe based on the provided code.",
