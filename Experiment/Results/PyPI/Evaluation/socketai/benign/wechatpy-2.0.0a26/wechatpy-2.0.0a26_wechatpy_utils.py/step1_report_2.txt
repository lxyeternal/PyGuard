  "purpose": "Utility functions for WeChat integration, including signature verification, data signing, encoding conversions, timezone handling, and random string generation.",
  "sources": "Input data includes parameters such as token, signature, timestamp, nonce, session_key, raw_data, client_signature, and arbitrary values passed to utility functions.",
  "sinks": "Signature verification functions compare signatures; data encoding functions convert data; random_string generates unpredictable strings; no direct data sinks are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in signature verification and hashing; data conversions flow from input to encoded/decoded outputs; random string generation uses internal randomness.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors. Use of standard libraries and straightforward cryptographic functions. No obfuscated code or unusual control flows. Random string generation relies on standard library, with no evident entropy issues.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions typical for SDKs or API integrations with WeChat. Signature checks involve cryptographic hashing with SHA-1, which is standard for this context. Data conversions handle encoding and decoding safely. Random string generation uses Python's random.sample, which is suitable for non-cryptographic purposes but not for cryptographic randomness. No malicious code or behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. Import statements and function logic are straightforward and adhere to best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for WeChat SDK operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The functions perform expected roles with standard libraries and practices. The use of random.sample for generating random strings is not cryptographically secure but aligns with typical usage in non-security-critical contexts.",
