{
  "purpose": "Define message classes and registration mechanisms for handling WeChat messages and component messages.",
  "sources": "Import statements (wechatpy.fields), class definitions, registration decorators, and class attributes",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks that send untrusted data externally; class attributes define fields, no apparent data leaks or external communications",
  "flows": "Data is stored within class instances; no explicit data flow from input to external sinks observed",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Use of deepcopy in metaclass might be unusual but is not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code or code executing untrusted input dynamically.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines message classes with associated fields for WeChat message handling, including registration decorators and a metaclass for class attribute management. No external network communication, no handling of sensitive data, and no code executing untrusted input or dynamically generated code. All code appears to be standard class definitions and registration logic for message types. No anomalies or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign message class definition module for WeChat SDK. No malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks are evident. The structure and logic are consistent with standard application code for message modeling.",
