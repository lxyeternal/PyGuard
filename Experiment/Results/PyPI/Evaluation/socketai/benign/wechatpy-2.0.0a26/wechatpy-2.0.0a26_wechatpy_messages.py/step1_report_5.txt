  "purpose": "Define message classes and registration mechanisms for WeChat messages and component messages.",
  "sources": "Input data received via message and component message constructors; data assigned to _data attribute.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of untrusted message data in class attributes and __repr__ method; no direct data leakage points observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into message class constructors, populates fields; no external sinks or network operations involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code primarily defines data structures and registration decorators.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a class hierarchy for handling WeChat messages with registration decorators for different message types. It uses deep copying of field descriptors to prevent shared state issues and defines properties for data access. No external network operations, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The code does not perform unsafe evaluations, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated techniques. It appears to be a standard message schema definition without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of message data structures with registration and metaclass usage. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this module. It functions as a schema definition for WeChat messages.",
