  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'wechatpy' Python SDK package, including dependencies, metadata, and package data.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, package definitions, dependency lists, and setup arguments.",
  "sinks": "Execution of setup(**setup_kwargs), which installs the package with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "flows": "The code constructs setup_kwargs dictionary with package info and dependencies, then calls setup() with these parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors; standard setup script. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious commands.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the standard 'setuptools' module for package setup. It defines packages, package data, dependencies, and additional requirements in structured variables. These are assembled into a dictionary 'setup_kwargs', which is then passed to the 'setup()' function to facilitate package installation. The code contains only standard packaging logic, with detailed project metadata, dependency management, and documentation links. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or potentially malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It adheres to normal package distribution practices without any suspicious code or actions.",
