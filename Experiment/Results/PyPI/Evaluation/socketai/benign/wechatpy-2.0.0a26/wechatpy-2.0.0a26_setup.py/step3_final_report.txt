{
  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the 'wechatpy' Python library, defining package metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Static variables defining packages, package data, dependencies, and long description; no external input or dynamic data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected. The ASCII art and documentation are static and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script using setuptools. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All dependencies are standard, and the script performs only package configuration. The long description includes ASCII art and documentation links, which are typical for open-source projects. No external data fetching, code injection, or network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the static and well-structured nature of the code.",
