  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only imports modules and configures logging",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports various modules from the 'wechatpy' library, indicating usage of WeChat API features. It sets a version and author metadata, and configures logging with a NullHandler to suppress warnings. No data input, output, or untrusted data handling is present, nor are there any suspicious code patterns or obfuscated elements.",
