The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0 and a very low security risk score (~0.1). I recommend maintaining these scores, with a slight adjustment of the security risk score to 0 for accuracy."

The main security consideration is the handling of untrusted XML input, which could be exploited via XML-based attacks if not properly configured. The malware score is 0, obfuscated is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting typical XML parsing risks. Overall, the code is safe for its purpose, with recommended precautions for XML security hardening if needed."

The use of SHA-1 and non-cryptographic randomness are acceptable for non-security-critical contexts but should be updated for cryptographic security. Overall, the code is safe, with no signs of malware or sabotage."
