{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for the wechatpy SDK to handle various error scenarios, serving as structured error reporting mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters (errcode, errmsg, return_code, result_code, return_msg, etc.) used to initialize exception attributes.",
  "sinks": "String representations (__str__, __repr__) output error details; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into exception attributes, then are formatted into strings for debugging or logging; no external data flow or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for error handling, with constructors assigning error codes and messages. String methods format error info for debugging. No external data sources, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present. The classes serve as data containers without processing untrusted input beyond parameter assignment. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code is standard, transparent, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for the wechatpy SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
