{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in the wechatpy library related to WeChat API interactions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data comes from internal exception parameters during error handling.",
  "sinks": "String representations (__str__, __repr__) that format exception details for display or logging.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation → string representation or logging output; no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines exception classes with constructors that accept error parameters and methods to output error information. It does not process external input beyond exception parameters, nor does it include any network, file, or environment interactions. The class hierarchy is straightforward, serving as data containers for error details. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or malicious payloads are evident. The code structure and content appear to be standard for a Python error handling module.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard exception class definition for a Python SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is safe and solely intended for error reporting within the library.",
