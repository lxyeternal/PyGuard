  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various WeChat API errors in the wechatpy library.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in exception constructors (errcode, errmsg, return_code, etc.), which are used to instantiate exception objects.",
  "sinks": "String representations (__str__, __repr__) of exception objects that output error details. No external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Error-related input data flows into exception objects during instantiation, then into string representations for display or logging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. Exception classes are straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes for error handling in the wechatpy SDK. Each class initializes with relevant error codes and messages, with some subclasses adding additional attributes. The string and representation methods output error details. No input validation or external data handling exists, and there are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of exception classes for error management in a Python SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or security risks.",
