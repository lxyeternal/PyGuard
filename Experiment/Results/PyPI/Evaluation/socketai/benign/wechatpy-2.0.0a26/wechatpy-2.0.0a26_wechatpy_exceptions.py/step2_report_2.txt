  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward set of custom exception classes for the wechatpy SDK.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or flows involving untrusted input or malicious payloads are identified.\n- The code is standard, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.\n- The purpose is error handling, with no evidence of malware, backdoors, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious behavior.\n- No signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or data leaks.\n- Exception classes are standard and serve as data containers for error information.\n- The attributes and methods are straightforward, with no external input processing beyond constructor parameters.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports. No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.5 or lower, since the code is purely definitional and does not introduce security risks.\n\n### Specific Points:\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is purely for error handling and contains no malicious logic.\n- The exception classes are standard and do not process untrusted data beyond parameter assignment.\n- No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The current scores seem appropriate given the analysis.\n- The risk scores could be slightly above 0 if considering the potential for misused exception messages, but since no untrusted input is processed, 0.5 is reasonable as an upper bound.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0.2 to 0.3** (to reflect that these are safe, standard exception classes with minimal risk)\n\n**Note:** The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The current report scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for the wechatpy SDK, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
