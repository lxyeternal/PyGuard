  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors in the wechatpy library related to WeChat API interactions.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; exception initialization parameters are internally controlled or passed during exception raising.",
  "sinks": "String representations (__str__, __repr__) that output error details; no external data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Exception objects are created with error details and then converted to strings for display or logging; no untrusted data flow outside controlled exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets present. The code strictly defines exception classes with straightforward attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for error handling in a WeChat-related Python library. It includes constructors setting error codes and messages, and string representations that output these details. There are no input data flows from external sources, nor are there any sinks or flows that involve untrusted data manipulation, network activity, or data exfiltration. The classes are standard exception definitions, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for error handling. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies detected. The code appears safe and straightforward.",
