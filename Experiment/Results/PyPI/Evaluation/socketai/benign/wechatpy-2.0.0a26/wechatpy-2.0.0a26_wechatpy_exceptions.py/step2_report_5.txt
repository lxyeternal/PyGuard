  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the security implications.\n\n**Summary of findings:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes for the wechatpy library.\n- The code is straightforward, with constructors setting attributes and string representations for debugging.\n- No external data input sources, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns are identified.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The exception classes serve as data containers for error handling, with no network, file, or environment interactions.\n\n**Security assessment:**\n\n- The code is purely definitional, focusing on error handling.\n- No data leaks, no malicious behavior, and no obfuscation are evident.\n- The malware score should be 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score should be 0, given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Scores consistency:**\n\n- The reports uniformly assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the code content.\n- The overall risk scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n\n- Since the code is only exception class definitions, the likelihood of malicious activity is negligible.\n- The only potential concern could be if these classes were used to hide malicious payloads, but there's no evidence of that here.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of exception classes with no security risks or malicious intent. The current scoring and analysis are accurate and consistent with the code content.",
