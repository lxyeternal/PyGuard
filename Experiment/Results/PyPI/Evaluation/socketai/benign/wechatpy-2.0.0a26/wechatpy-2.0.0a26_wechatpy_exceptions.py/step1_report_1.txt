{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various error conditions in the wechatpy library, mainly related to WeChat API interactions.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; the code defines classes and methods that process parameters passed during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages and attributes that could be outputted via __str__ or __repr__, potentially revealing error codes or messages, but no data leak or malicious sink present.",
  "flows": "Errors are instantiated with specific error codes and messages, and then converted to strings for display; no data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Exception classes are standard, and attribute handling is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions with constructors that assign attributes and string representations for debugging or logging. No suspicious logic, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no malicious payloads. The exception messages are parameterized and do not contain any untrusted input processing beyond standard attribute assignments. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides structured exception classes for the wechatpy library with no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is purely defining exception data structures without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
