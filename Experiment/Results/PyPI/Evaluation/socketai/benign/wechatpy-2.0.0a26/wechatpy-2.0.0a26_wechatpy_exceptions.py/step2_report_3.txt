  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review Summary:**\n   - The code defines a set of custom exception classes for the `wechatpy` library.\n   - These classes include `WeChatException`, `WeChatClientException`, `InvalidSignatureException`, `APILimitedException`, `InvalidAppIdException`, `InvalidMchIdException`, `WeChatOAuthException`, `WeChatComponentOAuthException`, and `WeChatPayException`.\n   - The classes primarily serve as structured data containers for error codes and messages, with string representations for debugging and logging.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, no external data processing, no network interactions, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.\n   - The exception classes do not process untrusted input beyond parameter assignment.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malware and Obfuscation:**\n   - The code is straightforward, standard for defining custom exceptions.\n   - No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n   - The malware score should be 0, as there's no evidence of malicious intent or payloads.\n\n3. **Assessment of Security Risks:**\n   - The code does not handle untrusted data in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities.\n   - Exception messages could potentially reveal error codes or messages, but this is typical for error reporting and not inherently risky.\n   - No security flaws or backdoors are detected.\n   - The security risk score should be 0.\n\n4. **Score Justification:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is standard, benign, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - The consistent assessment aligns with the code's nature as a simple exception class hierarchy.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct.\n- The security risk score should remain at 0.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in the `wechatpy` SDK. No malicious or security concerns are evident.",
