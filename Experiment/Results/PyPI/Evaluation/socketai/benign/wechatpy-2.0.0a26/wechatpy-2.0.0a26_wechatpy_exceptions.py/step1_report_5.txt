{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various WeChat API errors and related scenarios.",
  "sources": "None; all exception classes initialize with parameters passed during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external output occurs within the exception classes.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing pathways are present; these are simple class definitions for exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; standard exception class structures with straightforward parameter usage.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, tailored for different WeChat API error scenarios. Constructors primarily store input parameters such as error codes and messages. There is no handling of untrusted input beyond parameter assignment, nor any external data operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors, is evident. The code is purely definitional, serving as structured error representations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard exception class definitions for API error handling without any malicious intent or security issues. No suspicious behavior or malware signs are present.",
