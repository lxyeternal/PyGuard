  "purpose": "Define data structures for handling JS API card extension parameters in a WeChat SDK integration, including JSON serialization.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (time, json, dataclasses, typing), and from wechatpy.utils import random_string",
  "sinks": "Potential JSON serialization of class instances, usage of random_string for nonce generation",
  "flows": "Initialization of Scheme and JsApiCardExt objects, calling to_json method which serializes instance data",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. Usage of external library 'wechatpy.utils.random_string' appears standard, not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for specific WeChat JS SDK parameters, generating timestamp and nonce strings dynamically, and providing JSON serialization. No external inputs, no untrusted data sources, and no dangerous sinks or data flows are evident. The imported functions and libraries are standard, with no evidence of obfuscated or malicious behavior. The overall design appears consistent with normal SDK parameter handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation for managing JS API card extension parameters, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
