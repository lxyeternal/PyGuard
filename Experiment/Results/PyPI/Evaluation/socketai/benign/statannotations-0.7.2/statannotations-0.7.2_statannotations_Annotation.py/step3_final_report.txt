{
  "purpose": "Manages plot annotation data, supporting both raw strings and statistical result objects, with optional formatting.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'structs', 'data', and 'formatter'; data read during initialization and formatting.",
  "sinks": "Print statements for labels and formatted output; warnings issued via warnings.warn().",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to formatting and printing; warnings flow from data type checks to warnings module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data handling, no obfuscation, no external data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an annotation utility class that handles data as string or StatResult, formats data with an optional formatter, and outputs labels and formatted data. It issues warnings if data isn't a StatResult. There are no network, file, or system modifications, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious constructs. The use of warnings.warn() is benign, serving as validation. External classes are assumed safe. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or code injection is evident. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions indicate a very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for plot annotations with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores—malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0—are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
