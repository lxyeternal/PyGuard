{
  "purpose": "The code defines an Annotation class used for handling statistical annotations on plots, including formatting and displaying data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the constructor parameters 'structs', 'data', and 'formatter', and accesses properties 'text' and 'formatted_output'.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks are directly used; no data is sent over the network, written to files, or executed dynamically.",
  "flows": "Input data ('data') is processed through formatting functions and displayed via print statements, but there are no suspicious data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. The code relies on standard Python constructs and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports warning and typing modules, and references external classes 'Formatter' and 'StatResult'. The Annotation class encapsulates data, formatting, and output methods. It uses properties to format data, print labels, and verify data types. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The only potentially notable aspect is the use of warnings.warn() when data type validation fails, which is standard practice for non-critical warnings. No external network or system modification functions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation for managing plot annotations with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, suspicious data flows, or obfuscation. It is a standard, safe utility class for visualization purposes.",
