  "purpose": "The code defines an Annotation class used to manage and format statistical annotation data for plots.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; relies on input parameters and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data, no network operations, no file access, and no system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from initialization parameters to formatted outputs; no external or untrusted data sources are processed in a harmful way.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. Use of warnings.warn is benign here.",
  "analysis": "The class manages data and formatting for annotations, with no indications of malicious intent. It uses standard Python features, type annotations, and the warnings module for benign notifications. No hardcoded credentials, network activities, or system modifications are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility class for plot annotations with no malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely within the context of data formatting and display.",
