{
  "purpose": "The code defines an Annotation class used for managing annotations in statistical plots, formatting data, and printing labels.",
  "sources": "Reads class attributes such as structs, data, formatter, and method parameters like sep.",
  "sinks": "Uses print for output, warnings.warn for warnings, and accesses data attributes; no untrusted input handling or external network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data (possibly untrusted) flows from initialization (data, formatter) to properties and print output, but there's no indication of unsafe handling or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages data and formatting for plot annotations. It uses warnings and print statements for user communication. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or harmful operations. Usage of warnings.warn and print are standard for informational messages. No external data sources, or dangerous operations, or obfuscation were found.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of an annotation utility with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It manages data formatting and output within expected bounds.",
