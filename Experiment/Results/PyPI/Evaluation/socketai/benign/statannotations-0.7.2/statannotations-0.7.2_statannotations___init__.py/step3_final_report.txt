  "analysis": "The code declares __all__ for public symbols and imports __version__ from a local module. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, network activity, or suspicious constructs. The code is minimal and standard for Python package modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
