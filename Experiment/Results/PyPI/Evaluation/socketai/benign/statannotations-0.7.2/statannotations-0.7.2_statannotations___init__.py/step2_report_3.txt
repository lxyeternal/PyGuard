  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is minimal, consisting of an `__all__` declaration and an import of `__version__` from a local module.\n   - No data flows, sinks, or external interactions are present.\n   - No anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are observed.\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard for a Python package's initialization module.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly interpret the code's purpose and structure.\n   - No logical flaws or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The assessments of security risk, malware, and obfuscation are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 or 1.0, which is reasonable given the straightforward nature.\n     - `obfuscated`: 0, correct since there's no obfuscation.\n     - `malware`: 0, consistent with the benign analysis.\n     - `securityRisk`: 0, appropriate for such minimal, non-malicious code.\n   - No adjustments needed; scores align well with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is correct.\n   - The code is purely declarative and import-based, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - No malicious behavior is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All assessments are cautious and based on observable code.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about hidden behavior or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - The overall analysis aligns with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Given the minimal code, the risk is essentially nonexistent.\n- The import of `__version__` from a local module is standard practice and does not pose any security threat.\n- The use of `__all__` is typical for defining module exports.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
