  "purpose": "Defines module exports including version, stats, and Annotator components",
  "sources": "Importing __version__ from a local module",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations",
  "flows": "The import of __version__ into the namespace; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code declares __all__ for module exports and imports a version string from a local module. There are no external data inputs, no execution of dynamic code, and no indication of malicious intent. The structure is straightforward and standard for Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign, performing standard module export declarations and version import with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
