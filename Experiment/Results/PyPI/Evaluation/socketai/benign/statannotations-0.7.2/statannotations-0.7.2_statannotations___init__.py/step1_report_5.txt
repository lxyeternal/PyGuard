{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define public API components and import a version identifier from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ from the local _version module.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or exposed.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the local import of __version__ to the __all__ list exposing public symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares an __all__ list for module exports and imports a version string from a local module. It is standard practice for Python packages to manage API exposure and versioning. There is no evidence of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The code structure is straightforward and contains no complex or dynamic code execution that could indicate obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module declaration with a version import, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
