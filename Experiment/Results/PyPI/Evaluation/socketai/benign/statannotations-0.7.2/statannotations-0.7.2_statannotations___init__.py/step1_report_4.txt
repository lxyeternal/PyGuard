  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares exported symbols and imports a version string from a local module. It does not process or handle untrusted data, nor does it perform any system calls or network activities. The import is from a local module, which is common in Python packages for versioning. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard package setup code for defining module exports and importing version info. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks detected.",
