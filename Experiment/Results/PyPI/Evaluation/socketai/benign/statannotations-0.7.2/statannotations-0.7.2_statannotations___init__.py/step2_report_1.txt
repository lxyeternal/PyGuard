  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n**Code Review:**\n```python\n__all__ = [\"__version__\", \"stats\", \"Annotator\"]\nfrom ._version import __version__\n```\nThis is a minimal, standard module initialization pattern. It declares public API symbols and imports a version string from a local module. There are no dynamic code executions, no external data handling, no network activity, and no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and typical for Python package modules.\n- No data flows, no external inputs, no outputs, no dynamic code, no secrets.\n- The import of `__version__` from a local module `_version` is standard for version management.\n- The `__all__` list exposes specific symbols, aligning with common practices.\n\n### Issues in the Reports:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with confidence scores of 1.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, malware, or security risks are identified.\n- The reports do not identify any actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- The logic in the reports is sound; they correctly interpret the code as standard module setup.\n\n### Scoring and Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. There is no malware activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the code and the reports, **the scores are appropriate and consistent**. The code is a typical, harmless module declaration.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple, static module setup with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The import and export declarations are standard. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is benign, and the scoring aligns with the actual content. No further action or concern is necessary.",
