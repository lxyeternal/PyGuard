{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to expose module attributes, likely related to versioning and functionality (stats, Annotator).",
  "sources": "Reading the list __all__, importing __version__ from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "The code imports __version__ which could contain version info, but no data flows leading to malicious actions are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no anomalies or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines __all__ for module exports, imports __version__ from a relative module. There are no data inputs, outputs, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no network activity. The minimal structure is typical for a Python package module initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module initializer defining public attributes. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
