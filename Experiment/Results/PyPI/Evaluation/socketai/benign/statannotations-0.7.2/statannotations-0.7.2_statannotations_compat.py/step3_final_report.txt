  "purpose": "Provides compatibility wrappers and data handling utilities for seaborn plotting functions across different API versions, parsing groups/pairs, and transforming data for visualization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (x, y, hue, data, order, plot_params), internal seaborn classes and functions, density estimation support (KDE).",
  "sinks": "Processed data stored in internal plotter objects, no external system or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into internal plotter classes, which perform data parsing, validation, and transformation for plotting; no external data exfiltration or command execution occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of seaborn's internal classes (e.g., _CategoricalPlotter, _BoxPlotter) is unconventional but standard for compatibility; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages version-dependent imports, validates and parses plot groupings, and transforms data for plotting, including density KDE support. It does not execute external commands, access secrets, or perform network operations. The reliance on seaborn internal classes is a known practice for compatibility layers but could pose risks if seaborn is compromised. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured compatibility utility for seaborn plotting functions. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk 0.1 are appropriate and justified.",
