{
  "purpose": "This code provides plotting classes (_Plotter and _SeabornPlotter) for visualizing statistical data using Matplotlib and seaborn, including handling plot transformations, data structures, and plot-specific logic.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (numpy, matplotlib, statannotations), configuration and class initializations, and data retrieval methods such as get_group_data() from plotter objects.",
  "sinks": "Transformation functions (get_transform_func), data extraction in _get_value_pos methods, and plotting functions that could potentially process untrusted data or manipulate plot properties.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (like data, pairs, hue, etc.) through checks and data structure creation, then to plotting routines and transformation functions. For example, get_group_data() feeds data into structures; data is transformed via get_transform_func; plotting components utilize this data for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no suspicious or malicious code segments, nor any indication of data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden network activity. Usage of standard libraries and plotting functions appears benign. The code relies on external, well-known libraries for plotting and data management, with no obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of plot handling for statistical annotations. It manages data transformations, plotting, and annotation placement with careful checks and transformations. No suspicious behavior such as network calls, data theft, or backdoors is evident. The code's logic focuses on plotting and data structure management, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical plotting utility module for statistical data visualization. It contains no malicious code, no evidence of malware, and no security risks beyond standard plotting logic. It is safe and designed solely for visual data representation.",
