  "purpose": "Utility functions for data validation, error handling, and data processing in a plotting or data analysis context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (`x`, `data`, `pairs`, `hue`, `order`, `hue_order`, etc.), data extraction from pandas DataFrames or lists.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified that lead to data leaks, network communication, or system modification.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and checked against data; no untrusted data flows into dangerous system calls or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code mainly consists of validation and helper functions, with no malicious intent or side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines validation functions for data consistency, presence, and order, as well as error handling and utility methods. There are no operations that perform system modifications, network communication, or data exfiltration. The functions operate on input data and parameters, raising errors if inconsistencies are detected. No malicious or sabotage behavior is evident. The use of exceptions and data checks appears to be for robustness rather than malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of validation and utility functions intended for use in data visualization or analysis workflows. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The overall security risk is very low, with no indication of malicious intent or harmful side effects.",
