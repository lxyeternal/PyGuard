  "purpose": "Utility functions for data validation, error handling, and data retrieval in data analysis workflows.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from pandas DataFrames, lists, tuples, and parameters; reading column names, unique values, and data structures.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network, file, or system calls; primarily raises exceptions for validation failures.",
  "flows": "Source data is validated through functions that check membership, order, and consistency; errors are raised if validation fails.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; straightforward validation logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard data validation utilities, including checks for data presence, order, and consistency across pandas DataFrames and lists. It raises detailed exceptions on validation failures. No network activity, file operations, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present. The functions operate solely on data structures, with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The code's purpose is to ensure data integrity before visualization or analysis, and it does not perform any malicious actions or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of validation utilities with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for supply chain use, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
