{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions and error handling for data validation, parameter checking, and data integrity in a data analysis or visualization context, likely related to plotting or data annotation.",
  "sources": "Input data via function parameters such as `data`, `x`, `pair`, `hue`, `hue_order`, and `text_format`.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input directly leading to security vulnerabilities. No network, file, or system command operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through validation functions that check presence, validity, and consistency of data values; no dangerous data flow paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive parameter validation and data checks but does not exhibit any suspicious or unusual code behavior, obfuscation, or hidden logic. All code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of validation and utility functions designed to ensure data integrity and correctness before further processing. It performs checks for data presence, value validity, and consistency across data structures. There are no network operations, system calls, or code execution that could indicate malicious intent. The functions handle exceptions cleanly, and all operations are typical for data validation. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be well-structured, purpose-driven, and secure in its current form.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of validation utilities for data integrity and correctness, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard application code intended for parameter and data validation. No malicious or sabotage intent is detectable.",
