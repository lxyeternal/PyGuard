  "purpose": "Utility functions for data validation, error handling, and data processing in a visualization or data analysis context.",
  "sources": "Data inputs from pandas DataFrame columns, list/tuple inputs, function parameters such as 'x', 'pairs', 'hue', 'order', 'hue_order', and other user-provided parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe use of user inputs if they influence data selection or processing, but no direct sinks such as network operations, file writing, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (dataframes, lists, parameters) -> validation functions -> raising errors or returning processed data. No external data flow or untrusted command execution observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns such as obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Functions perform standard data validation and checks, with no evident malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides validation functions to ensure data consistency and correctness for plotting or data manipulation tasks. It includes error handling, value checking, and data integrity validation. The code does not perform network operations, file access, or any system-level commands that could be malicious. All functions are standard, well-documented, and serve typical data validation purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of data validation utilities intended for use within a larger data analysis or visualization library. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code segment. It appears safe and legitimate.",
