  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Data Flow:** Describes classes for formatting p-values, with configuration and validation.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Reads parameters; outputs formatted strings.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no external network/file operations, straightforward formatting.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard formatting utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar in scope and detail to Report 1, emphasizing configuration management and formatting.\n- No suspicious behavior, no external interactions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on formatting for visualization, with validation and configuration.\n- No external system interactions or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Describes typical formatting for statistical annotations.\n- No signs of malicious activity, external data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, emphasizing safe formatting practices.\n- No suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Behavior & Purpose:** All reports describe code that solely handles formatting and validation of statistical p-values and annotations. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or system compromise.\n- **External Interactions:** No network, file system, or system modifications are present.\n- **Obfuscation & Anomalies:** No obfuscated code, suspicious dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors.\n- **Supply Chain Risks:** The code depends on known external libraries (`statannotations`) and internal validation, with no signs of tampering or malicious dependencies.\n\n### Final Risk Scores:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Overall Security Risk:** 0 (safe, standard utility for statistical formatting)\n\n### Justification:\nGiven the detailed review, the code is a benign, well-structured utility for formatting statistical annotations. All indications point toward a safe, legitimate component with no malicious or security-compromising features.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Estimated Malware Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Estimated Security Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's functionality.",
