{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for formatting statistical p-value annotations, including configurable formatting styles and thresholds, primarily used for data visualization purposes in statistical analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (statannotations.format_annotations, statannotations.stats.StatResult, statannotations.utils), and internal class attributes and methods that process formatting parameters and statistical results.",
  "sinks": "None identified. The code does not read untrusted input directly or write untrusted data to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code primarily processes data internally for formatting purposes without external data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no unusual logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for formatting statistical p-values and annotations. It manages formatting parameters, thresholds, and presentation styles. All functions operate within a safe context—no user input is directly handled, no external network or file operations are present. The methods include parameter validation, property setters/getters, and simple formatting logic. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected. The imports are from standard and external libraries for statistical annotation purposes and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of formatting logic for statistical annotations with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain compromise, or security risks. It is safe and intended for use in statistical data visualization. The code is well-structured and does not contain suspicious patterns or activities.",
