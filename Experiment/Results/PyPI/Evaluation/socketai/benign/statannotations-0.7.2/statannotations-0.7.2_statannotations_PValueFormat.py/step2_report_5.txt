  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is for formatting p-value annotations, with no malicious behaviors or security risks identified.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code solely handles formatting, validation, and configuration management. No external network, file, or system access is evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1. These are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues. The code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the absence of malicious behavior, external communication, or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's purpose. The print statements are for user guidance, not malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1. These are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign utility for formatting statistical annotations, with no external system interaction.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code performs internal data processing and string formatting only.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1. These are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is for formatting statistical annotations, with no external data handling or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The detailed reasoning confirms the absence of malicious patterns or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1. These are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a safe utility for formatting statistical annotations, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is thorough, noting the absence of external data handling, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1. These are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is solely for formatting statistical annotations, validation, and configuration management.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified given the absence of malicious code, dynamic execution, or external communication.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly note the code is clear and not obfuscated.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the assessments. The code is a standard, safe utility for statistical annotation formatting, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's functionality.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, legitimate, and free from malicious or obfuscated components. The current scoring is appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
