{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for formatting p-value annotations and statistical results, primarily for visualization or reporting purposes in statistical analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from method parameters, class attributes, and imported functions such as 'pval_annotation_text' and 'check_valid_text_format'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs formatted strings for display or logging; no data is written to files, network, or system resources.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through class methods to generate formatted annotation texts, with no external untrusted data sources involved; internal logic converts data into display strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. No obfuscated code, malicious network connections, or system modifications are observed. The only notable behavior is standard data formatting and validation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical formatting and validation tasks for statistical data; it imports external formatting functions but does not execute code from external sources dynamically. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors are detected. All operations are related to formatting and configuration management. There are no obfuscated patterns, hidden code, or malicious data handling procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The source code appears to be a legitimate formatting utility for statistical annotations with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on standard class attributes and imported functions for formatting and validation, with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
