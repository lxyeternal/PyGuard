  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: presence of issues, logical flaws, score appropriateness, and potential security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines classes for formatting p-values, with validation, thresholds, and formatting options. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic. The use of dynamic attribute setting is standard for configuration classes.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's nature. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on formatting statistical p-values, thresholds, and legend printing. No malicious activity or obfuscation observed.\n- **Assessment:** The print statements for legend display are benign. The code performs validation and formatting without external system interactions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on formatting classes for statistical annotations, with validation and formatting logic. No external or malicious operations.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a utility for visualization formatting, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's evaluation is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with focus on formatting statistical p-values. No suspicious behavior or external threats.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard formatting utility, with no malicious or obfuscated code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment is correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a benign formatting utility for statistical annotations, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** No external or malicious behaviors detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which is consistent with the code analysis.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected in any report.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code (configuration and formatting utility), and the absence of external system interaction, the security risk remains very low.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to potential misconfiguration if parameters are set maliciously, but overall very safe.\n\n**Note:** Since the code is purely formatting and validation logic with no external system access, these scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate; the code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are reasonable and should remain as is.",
