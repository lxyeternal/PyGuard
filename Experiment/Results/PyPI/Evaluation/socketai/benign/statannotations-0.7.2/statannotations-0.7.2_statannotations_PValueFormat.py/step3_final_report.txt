{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and methods for formatting statistical p-values and annotations, including configuration, validation, and presentation logic for different formats such as 'star', 'full', and 'simple'.",
  "sources": "Parameters for formatting and thresholds, validation functions, and input result objects containing p-values and test names.",
  "sinks": "Generated formatted strings for display or reporting purposes; no external data sinks or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and validation functions serve as sources; formatted annotation strings are the outputs; data flows through configuration setters and formatting methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution detected. The code is straightforward and relies on standard libraries and internal validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility for formatting statistical annotations, with configuration management, validation, and string formatting. It does not perform external network access, file operations, or system modifications. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The functions and classes serve purely for formatting and validation purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The use of external libraries is standard, and the code structure is clear and well-documented. Given these observations, the code is benign and safe for supply chain use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious utility for statistical annotation formatting. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis and should remain at malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1.",
  "confidence": 1,
