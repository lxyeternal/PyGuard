  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security issues, malware, obfuscation, and the consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a formatting utility for statistical p-values, with validation and configuration management. No external network, file, or system modifications are observed. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code review. The code is purely for formatting and validation, with no suspicious behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a formatting utility with validation, thresholds, and legend printing. No external or malicious activity is detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. The print statements are benign, serving informational purposes.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a formatting class for statistical annotations, with parameter validation and safe string formatting. No external system interaction or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard utility, and the review is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on formatting statistical p-values, with no suspicious or malicious patterns. No external data handling or system modifications.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is safe and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with no anomalies, external threats, or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident in any of the code snippets or descriptions.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors are present.\n\n- **Malware risk:** The code performs purely formatting, validation, and string generation. No network, file, or system modifications are observed.\n\n- **Security risk:** The code is a utility module with no external data handling or external dependencies that could be exploited.\n\n- **Scores adjustment:** All scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are appropriately zero. The confidence is high (1), given the thorough analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n| Metric            | Score  | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0       | No malicious code, no dynamic execution, no external threats |\n| Obfuscated        | 0       | Clear, readable code, no obfuscation techniques used        |\n| Security Risk     | 0       | No vulnerabilities, no external data leaks or system modifications |\n\n**Overall, the supply chain security risk for this code is negligible.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a safe, well-structured utility for statistical annotation formatting with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned by the reports are accurate and justified.",
