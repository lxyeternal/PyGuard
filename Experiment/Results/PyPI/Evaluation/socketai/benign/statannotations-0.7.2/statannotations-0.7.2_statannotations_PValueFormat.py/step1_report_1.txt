{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes and functions for formatting p-value annotations in statistical results, with customizable parameters and thresholds.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters (e.g., 'result', 'parameters') and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write data to external sources or perform any network operations, file writes, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., 'result') flows through formatting functions to produce annotation strings; configuration parameters influence formatting behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code primarily focuses on formatting and validation; no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured, focusing on statistical annotation formatting with validation and configuration management. No external network or system access is evident. No signs of malware, code injection, or data leakage. The functions serve purely formatting purposes with standard practices and explicit validation. The only minor concern could be the use of dynamic attribute setting and validation, but this is standard for configuration classes and not malicious. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for formatting statistical p-values and annotations, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs validation and formatting based on user parameters without external harmful actions.",
