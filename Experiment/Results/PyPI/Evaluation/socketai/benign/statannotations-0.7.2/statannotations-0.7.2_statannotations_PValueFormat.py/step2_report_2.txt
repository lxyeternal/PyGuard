  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core points: presence of issues, logical flaws, scoring appropriateness, and potential security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation. The code is purely for formatting statistical p-values.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both set to 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a standard formatting utility, with no signs of security risks.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the lack of external system interaction, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, justified by the code's benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies the code as a safe utility for statistical annotation formatting.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a safe formatting utility with no external interactions or malicious behaviors.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, consistent with the findings.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is thorough and aligns with the code's functionality.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—benign code for formatting statistical annotations, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, matching the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** The report's reasoning is consistent and justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reinforces that the code is a safe, standard implementation for formatting, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Both 0, justified.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward, safe utility for formatting statistical p-values and annotations. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The risk and malware scores are all set to 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores based on the collective analysis:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThe reports' scores are consistent with the code's behavior and the detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured utility for statistical annotation formatting with no security concerns. The provided scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
