{
  "purpose": "This code provides classes and functions for formatting statistical p-value annotations in visualizations, supporting various formatting styles and thresholds.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration parameters (via the config method), formatting strings, thresholds, and statistical result objects (StatResult).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external outputs are present; the code primarily processes and formats data internally without external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Input configuration and statistical results flow through formatting functions, with conditional formatting based on internal state and user parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard Python constructs and safe string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines formatter classes for statistical p-value annotations, with methods for configuration, threshold management, and data formatting. It validates parameters, manages internal states, and formats statistical p-values for visualization purposes. There are no external system calls, network operations, or file manipulations. The code adheres to expected behavior for a visualization annotation utility, with standard safety checks and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for formatting statistical annotations, with no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured and does not contain any suspicious or harmful operations.",
