  "purpose": "Utility for managing group positions, labels, and offsets in plotting contexts such as seaborn.",
  "sources": "Input sequences (group_names, hue_names), internal pandas DataFrame (_data).",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures, warnings; no external data or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into position calculations, stored in DataFrame, used for plotting and lookup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs position calculations, label generation, and group lookups. It uses standard Python, numpy, pandas, and itertools. No network, file, or external system interactions are present. No obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or hardcoded secrets are detected. Warnings are used for non-critical positional issues, which is standard. The logic appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility for managing group positions in data visualization. There are no indicators of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.",
