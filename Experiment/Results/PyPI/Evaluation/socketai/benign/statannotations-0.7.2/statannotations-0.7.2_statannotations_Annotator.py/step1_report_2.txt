{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python class for annotating plots with statistical test results, p-values, and custom annotations, mainly for use with seaborn plots.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from plot data (via seaborn/Matplotlib), annotation parameters, p-values, and comparison data structures.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs annotations and plot modifications; no data leaks or sensitive data exfiltration are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from statistical test functions, user-provided p-values, or custom annotations into plot annotations and labels; no external network or file interactions are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscation; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected. The code uses warnings, but solely for user notification.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of a plot annotation utility for statistical significance testing, with functions for configuration, applying tests, setting p-values, and plotting annotations. It interacts only with plotting objects, data structures, and user parameters. No external network connections, file manipulations, or system-level modifications are present. The import statements are all from standard and third-party scientific libraries, with no indication of malicious dependencies or obfuscated code. The code does not contain any backdoors, system commands, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Its functions perform typical statistical plotting tasks, with appropriate checks and warnings, and no suspicious behavior is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for statistical plotting and annotation, with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data theft. The usage of dependencies is consistent with scientific plotting tasks, and no obfuscation or hidden logic is present.",
