  "purpose": "A plotting utility class for adding statistical annotations to seaborn/matplotlib plots, supporting custom text, p-value formatting, and statistical testing results.",
  "sources": "Input data from plotting parameters, user-provided data, and configuration settings within the plotting and annotation process.",
  "sinks": "Modifies plot elements such as annotations, lines, and axes; no external data exfiltration or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through statistical tests or custom annotations into plot modifications, with no external system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; standard libraries used, no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured plotting utility for seaborn/matplotlib, focused on statistical annotations. It performs validation, plotting, and annotation tasks without external network or file operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The logic is straightforward, relying on standard libraries, and no suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe visualization utility with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are consistent and justified.",
