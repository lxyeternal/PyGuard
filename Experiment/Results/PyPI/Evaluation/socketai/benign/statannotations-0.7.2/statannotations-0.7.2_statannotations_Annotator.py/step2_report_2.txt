  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, data flow, potential vulnerabilities, and the overall security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes the Annotator class for adding statistical annotations to seaborn plots, relying on standard plotting and statistical libraries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows within the plotting context; no external data leaks or system modifications.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external system interactions. The code performs expected plotting and statistical annotation tasks.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate utility, no malicious behavior, no security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar description; code for annotating seaborn plots with statistical results.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external network or file operations; only plot modifications.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation detected. Uses standard libraries; no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate plotting utility; no security concerns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; code for statistical annotation.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Modifies plot annotations and axes; no external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation; standard plotting and statistical testing.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid visualization utility, no security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar description; class for adding statistical annotations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Only plot modifications; no external system interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe plotting utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, a plotting annotation utility.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data confined within plotting functions; no external communication.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe and standard plotting utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Purpose:** All reports describe a plotting utility for statistical annotations, primarily for seaborn/matplotlib plots.\n- **Data Flow & Behavior:** All data flows are within the plotting context, with no external network, file, or system command execution.\n- **Malicious Indicators:** None detected. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports have malware, obfuscated, and risk scores set to 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**These scores are reasonable and should not be adjusted.**\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured plotting utility for statistical annotations with no security concerns.",
