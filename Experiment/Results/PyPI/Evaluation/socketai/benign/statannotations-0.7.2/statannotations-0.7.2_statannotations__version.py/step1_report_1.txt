{
  "purpose": "The code defines the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data leaks or untrusted data outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only assigns a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is a straightforward version assignment with no unusual elements.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single assignment statement setting '__version__' to '0.7.2'. This is a common practice in Python packages to specify the version number. There are no input sources, no data flows, and no suspicious behavior or obfuscated code present. The simplicity indicates it is unlikely to contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a benign version declaration, typical in Python packages, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
