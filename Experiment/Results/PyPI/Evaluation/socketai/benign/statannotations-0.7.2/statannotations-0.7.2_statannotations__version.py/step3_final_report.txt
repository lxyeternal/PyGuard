  "purpose": "Assign a version string to __version__ indicating the package version.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a direct assignment of a string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow, input, or output involved.",
  "flows": "None; straightforward assignment without data flow or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal, standard, and free of obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a version string to __version__, a common pattern in Python packages. No input sources, data flows, or dynamic behaviors are present. The code does not perform any network activity, data handling, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, with confidence 1, reflecting certainty based on the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security issues. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's content.",
