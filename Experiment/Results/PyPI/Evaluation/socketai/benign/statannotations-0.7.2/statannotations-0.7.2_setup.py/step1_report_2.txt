{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package called 'statannotations', facilitating package distribution and dependency management.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string from '_version.py', reads the README.md for long description, and reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "The code processes dependencies for installation; no direct untrusted data sink or data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "Version info from '_version.py' and dependencies from 'requirements.txt' flow into the setup() function for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code performs standard setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The code reads static files ('README.md', '_version.py', 'requirements.txt') to gather metadata and dependencies for packaging. It uses regex to extract version info, which is a common and safe pattern. The 'remove_dev_only' function filters dependencies, which is a normal operation. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activities are present. All functions and operations are standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads static files, processes dependencies, and invokes setup() accordingly. There are no indications of malicious or maliciously injected code.",
