{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'statannotations' Python package, including reading metadata, dependencies, and version information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file for long description, the version string from '_version.py', and the requirements.txt file for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None of the sources are directly linked to untrusted data sinks that could lead to data leakage or malicious actions. No system commands or external calls are made.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input files (README.md, _version.py, requirements.txt) into variables, then into the setup() function for package configuration. No user input or network data is involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are detected. The code performs standard package setup routines with file reads and regex parsing. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior found.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files for package metadata and dependencies, processes the version string with regex, filters dependencies, and invokes setup() with collected data. All operations are straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts. No signs of malicious code, such as dynamic code execution, network activity, or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely reads required files and prepares the package configuration without any suspicious or malicious actions.",
