  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging, reading static files for metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md, _version.py, and requirements.txt files; static data extraction.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; data flows from static files into variables for setup.",
  "flows": "File reads (README.md, _version.py, requirements.txt) into variables used in setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical package setup routines: reading static files, extracting version info via regex, filtering dependencies, and calling setup(). No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The dependency filtering is benign, and no secrets or credentials are hardcoded. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate a safe package build process.",
