{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'statannotations' Python package, including reading dependencies, version info, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'statannotations/_version.py' for version string, reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, and reading files for package setup.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that process untrusted data; all data sources are from local files or static content.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous operations; the setup process is straightforward file reading and package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code snippets identified. The use of regex to parse version info is standard, not obfuscated. No dynamic code execution or network operations present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs static file reads for package setup: obtaining the long description, version string, and dependencies. It filters dependencies to exclude certain dev-only packages. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. There are no indications of malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code’s structure and content align with common setup.py practices. No obfuscation, malware, or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It performs no malicious actions, contains no malware, and poses no security threats. All operations involve reading local files and configuring package metadata.",
