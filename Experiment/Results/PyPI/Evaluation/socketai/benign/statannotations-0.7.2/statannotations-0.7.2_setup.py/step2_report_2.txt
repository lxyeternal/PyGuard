  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard `setup.py`-like script for packaging a Python project.\n- It reads static files (`README.md`, `_version.py`, `requirements.txt`) to gather metadata.\n- It uses regex to extract the version string, which is common practice.\n- The `remove_dev_only()` function filters dependencies, excluding \"statsmodels\" and \"packaging\" if present.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected.\n- The code operates solely on local files, with straightforward data flow.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue Presence & Validity**\n\n**Do the reports correctly identify the absence of malicious or suspicious behavior?**\n\n**Yes.** All reports correctly conclude that the code is standard, safe, and performs typical package setup routines.\n\n---\n\n### **Error or Flaw Identification**\n\n**Are there any errors or flaws in the reports?**\n\n- No. All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Scores Evaluation**\n\n**Malware Score:**\n\n- All reports assign `malware` = 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The code does not contain any malicious payloads, dynamic code execution, or network activity.\n\n**Security Risk Score:**\n\n- Most reports assign `securityRisk` = 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable.\n- Slight variation (0.1) in report 2 might be due to cautiousness, but given the code's simplicity, 0 is more appropriate.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n\n- All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\n- No changes needed; scores are consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1.\n- Given the code's straightforward nature, a higher score would be unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n\n- All reports avoid speculative claims; they base their conclusions on static analysis.\n- No unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Consistency of Scores**\n\n- All scores align with the code's characteristics.\n- No discrepancies observed.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Personal Assessment**\n\n**Malware Score:** **0**  \n**Obfuscated Score:** **0**  \n**Risk Score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The code performs only static file reads, regex parsing, and package setup.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The dependency filtering is benign.\n- The code is typical for Python package setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. The code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation, and the risk is negligible.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores:  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's behavior and the analysis provided.",
