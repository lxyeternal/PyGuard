  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Standard setup script reading static files for metadata.\n- Sinks & Flows: No untrusted data sinks; straightforward data flow.\n- Anomalies: None detected; code performs typical package setup routines.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: No signs of malicious behavior; code is safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Same as above, with emphasis on dependency filtering.\n- Sinks & Flows: No data leakage or external data processing.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious activity; dependency filtering is benign.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Standard setup code; no malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the slight risk score might be overestimated given the benign nature, but perhaps reflects a cautious stance. Still, justified as minimal.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Similar setup, emphasizing static file reads.\n- Sinks & Flows: No untrusted data sinks.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious behavior; regex parsing is standard.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Safe, conventional setup script.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Standard package setup operations.\n- Sinks & Flows: No untrusted data processing.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies; straightforward code.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: No malicious activity detected.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Same as others; no deviation.\n- Sinks & Flows: No untrusted data or network activity.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Standard, safe setup script.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code reads static files, extracts version info, filters dependencies, and calls setup() — all standard operations. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, straightforward, and uses common patterns (file reads, regex). No obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the above, a risk score of 0 or very close to 0 is appropriate. The second report's 0.1 might be slightly high, but it's acceptable if the scoring system accounts for cautious defaults.\n\n### Overall Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior.\n- No changes needed; all assessments are reasonable.\n\n### Final Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or 0.1 for conservative caution)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
