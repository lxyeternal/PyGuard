  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'statannotations', including reading version info, dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sources": [
    "Reading README.md for long_description",
    "Reading _version.py to extract version string",
    "Reading requirements.txt for dependencies"
  ],
  "sinks": [
    "setup() function where package installation details are specified",
    "Reading and processing dependencies from external files"
  ],
  "flows": [
    "Read README.md -> assign to long_description",
    "Read _version.py -> extract version string",
    "Read requirements.txt -> process dependencies -> pass to install_requires",
    "Call setup() with collected data"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets",
    "No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code",
    "Dependency filtering via remove_dev_only appears benign",
    "No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors present"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading project metadata, extracting version info via regex, filtering dependencies, and invoking setup(). All file reads are from local files, and no untrusted data is processed at runtime. The code follows conventional patterns without any suspicious constructs. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is evident, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent. The code is well-structured and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup configuration script for a Python package with no indications of malicious activity or security risks. It safely handles version extraction and dependency management without external data injection or covert operations.",
