  "purpose": "This code is for setting up and configuring the 'statannotations' Python package, including reading version info, dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, reads the version string from '_version.py', and reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt'.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reads input data (README.md, version file, requirements.txt) without processing untrusted data; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs standard setup operations. No suspicious or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary setup functions, reads static files for package metadata, extracts version info with regex, filters dependencies, and calls setup() with this info. All file operations are straightforward and safe. No untrusted input handling or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply prepares package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
