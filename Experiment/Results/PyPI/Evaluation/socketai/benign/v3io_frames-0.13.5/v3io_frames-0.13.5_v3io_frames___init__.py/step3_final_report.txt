  "purpose": "Client setup and session management for connecting to Iguazio's Frames service via gRPC or HTTP, handling environment variables and credentials securely.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for credentials and session info, URL parsing, function parameters for configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; primarily configuration and network client instantiation.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables and parameters to session creation and client instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; standard practices used.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard client configuration, session management, and validation of URLs and credentials. It relies on environment variables for sensitive data, which is common but should be managed securely. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or insecure behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard client setup module for connecting to Iguazio's platform. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, considering environment variable handling. The malware and obfuscated scores are 0, reflecting the code's clarity and safety.",
