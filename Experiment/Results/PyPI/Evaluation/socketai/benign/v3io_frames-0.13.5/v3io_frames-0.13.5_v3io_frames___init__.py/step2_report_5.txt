  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is primarily a client setup utility for connecting to the Iguazio platform's Frames service.\n- It handles environment variables, URL parsing, session creation, and client instantiation.\n- No data processing, network activity, or data leaks are present in this code snippet.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected.\n- The code relies on standard practices for configuration and connection setup.\n- The use of broad imports (`from .errors import *`) is noted but not inherently malicious; it could obscure specific imports but is common in package modules.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Legitimate client setup for data streaming.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns; standard environment variable handling.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues. The high confidence (0.9) aligns with the analysis.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar client configuration with session management.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior; standard handling.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity detected.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Client setup with environment variables and validation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code; proper validation.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; no issues.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Connection to the platform, session management.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity; standard practices.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Valid; the code is safe.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Client connection setup, similar to others.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior; safe handling.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Behavior:** None of the reports identify any malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code is purely configuration and connection logic.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** The risk score of 0.2 across reports reflects a low but non-zero concern, mainly due to handling of environment variables and credentials. This is standard and acceptable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Remains at **0.2**—appropriate given the context of environment variable handling and configuration.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\n**Overall, the code is legitimate, with no malicious or obfuscated patterns. The security risk is minimal and related to standard environment variable handling.**",
