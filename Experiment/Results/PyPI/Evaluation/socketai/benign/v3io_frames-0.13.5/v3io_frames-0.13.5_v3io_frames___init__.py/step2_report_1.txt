  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code sets up a client connection to the Iguazio platform, handling environment variables and parameters securely, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious network activity. Use of environment variables is standard for configuration.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable given the code's purpose.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment appears accurate; the code is legitimate.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on session setup and configuration, with standard practices.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code or suspicious activity. Environment variables are used appropriately.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on configuration and session setup, with validation of protocols and credentials.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. Standard handling of environment variables.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar client setup with environment variables, validation, and session management.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe client initialization module.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Client connection setup with environment variables, no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, standard practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** The code is legitimate.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which aligns with the code's functionality—configuration and connection setup, not data processing or execution of untrusted code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 across all reports seems appropriate given the handling of sensitive credentials via environment variables, which is standard but should be managed securely.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — standard configuration code, minor risk due to environment variable handling.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a legitimate client setup module with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The risk score could be slightly lowered to 0.1 if we consider the reliance on environment variables as a minor security concern, but 0.2 remains acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (or possibly 0.1 for more conservative estimate)  \n\nThis detailed review confirms the code's benign nature and appropriate scoring.",
