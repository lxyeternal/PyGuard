{
  "purpose": "The code defines a client for interacting with Iguazio's Frames service, enabling data streaming and session management via gRPC or HTTP protocols.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('V3IO_SESSION', 'V3IO_API', 'V3IO_ACCESS_KEY', 'V3IO_USERNAME', 'V3IO_PASSWORD') and function parameters (address, token, user, password, session_id).",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted inputs are used to initialize session objects, but no direct data leaks or harmful actions are performed in the code itself.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and function parameters serve as sources that influence session configuration; these are used to create Session objects which then configure network clients.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behavior, such as obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious network activity, is evident. Use of environment variables for session info is standard; no hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs setup and configuration for network communication with Iguazio's platform, handling authentication via tokens or username/password, and environment variables. It validates protocols and constructs session objects securely. No malicious behavior or malicious code patterns are found. The use of environment variables is standard for configuration; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity is evident. The code relies on external modules and environment data without performing any secret exfiltration or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a client configuration utility for Iguazio's platform. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It responsibly manages credentials and session data, with no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
