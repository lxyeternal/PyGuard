      "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The dependency sourcing practices are standard, and no suspicious patterns are present. The security risk and malware scores should remain at 0, with a very low risk score (~0.1) justified by the static nature of the script. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent."

The low risk score of 0.2 is appropriate, considering environment variable handling. The malware and obfuscated scores are 0, reflecting the code's clarity and safety."
