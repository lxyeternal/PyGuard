  "purpose": "Defines data type classes with matching logic for serialization and validation, mapping Python types to protobuf types.",
  "sources": "Type matching methods and the dtype_of function iterating over class subclasses.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "Input values are checked against type classes; dtype_of returns the matching type class.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of data type classes with matching logic, used for serialization or validation. It employs standard Python and numpy features, with no external data sources, network calls, or file I/O. The dtype_of function performs a linear search over a small set of classes, which is acceptable and not security-relevant. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The match methods correctly handle special cases, such as booleans, to avoid misclassification. The code's purpose appears benign and utility-oriented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility module for data type handling with no security concerns. All reports' assessments are accurate; the code does not contain malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
