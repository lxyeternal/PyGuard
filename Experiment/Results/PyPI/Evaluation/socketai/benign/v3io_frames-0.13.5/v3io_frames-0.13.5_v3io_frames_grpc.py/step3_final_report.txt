{
  "purpose": "This code implements a gRPC client for data operations including read, write, delete, execute, and version checking, facilitating communication with a remote server for data management tasks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as session info, backend, table, query, filters, commands, and arguments used to construct protobuf requests; server responses containing data frames or status messages.",
  "sinks": "Data is transmitted over network via gRPC requests; responses are processed into pandas DataFrames or raw frames. No evidence of data exfiltration or malicious sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> protobuf request objects -> gRPC server -> responses -> data deserialization into pandas DataFrames or raw frames; version checks and retries are standard control flows.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity observed. Retry and version check mechanisms are standard, with no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured gRPC client with standard error handling, retries, and version compatibility checks. It uses common libraries and patterns without obfuscation or malicious constructs. Data flows are typical for such clients, with no suspicious data leaks or backdoors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's characteristics and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of a gRPC client for data operations. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned scores are appropriate, indicating a safe component with minimal security risk.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
