  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as auto-generated gRPC boilerplate for protobuf services related to 'Frames'.\n- The server methods are placeholders raising 'NotImplementedError', indicating no business logic is present.\n- There are typographical errors in 'WriteRespose' instead of 'WriteResponse', which is typical of generated code but not malicious.\n- No signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are present.\n- The code does not process untrusted data in a way that would cause security issues; it merely serializes/deserializes protobuf messages.\n- No evidence of malware, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n\n**Specific points per report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Clarifies the code is auto-generated scaffolding.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0\n- Noted typo ('WriteRespose') could cause runtime errors but is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** No security concern; just a typo.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar overview; emphasizes unimplemented methods.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero, but justified by the typo and placeholder nature)\n- No malicious behavior; standard boilerplate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Similar, emphasizes no untrusted data sinks.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0.1\n- Minor typo; no security implications.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard generated code, no malicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same general overview.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0.1\n- Typo present but benign.\n- **Conclusion:** No security issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar; notes unimplemented methods and standard patterns.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Risk: 0.2 (slightly higher, possibly due to the placeholder nature)\n- No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, boilerplate code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, and the code is typical auto-generated scaffolding. **Set to 0.0.**\n\n**Obfuscated score:** No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and generated from protobuf definitions. **Set to 0.0.**\n\n**Risk score:** Since the code is purely scaffolding with no logic, no data handling vulnerabilities, and no malicious intent, the risk is minimal. The slight increase in some reports (up to 0.2) is due to placeholder nature and minor typos, not actual security risk.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a conservative, minimal risk for placeholder code with minor typos)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, auto-generated gRPC service scaffold with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor typographical errors are typical of generated code and do not impact security. The overall security risk is negligible.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is benign.",
