  "purpose": "Auto-generated gRPC client and server scaffolding for protobuf-defined 'Frames' service.",
  "sources": "Protobuf message classes and method definitions, primarily in the import statements and method signatures.",
  "sinks": "Serialization/deserialization functions for protobuf messages; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Serialization of request objects before network transmission; deserialization of responses upon receipt; no data processing or external data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in 'WriteRespose' instead of 'WriteResponse' across multiple classes; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated gRPC scaffold with placeholder methods raising NotImplementedError. The typo is a minor code-generation artifact and does not indicate malicious intent. No data leaks, external system effects, or suspicious behaviors are present. The high obfuscation score in some reports is unwarranted; the code is straightforward and generated from protobuf definitions. The minimal security risk and malware scores are appropriate, given the benign, boilerplate nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, auto-generated gRPC scaffolding with minor typographical errors. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is negligible, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
