{
  "purpose": "The code defines gRPC client and server classes for protobuf-defined services related to 'Frames' operations.",
  "sources": "Imports of grpc library and protobuf message classes from frames_pb2 module.",
  "sinks": "None of the functions process untrusted data directly; request serializers/deserializers handle data serialization. No data leaks or external system effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Client-side: methods serialize requests and send to server; server-side: methods deserialize requests and prepare responses. No untrusted data flow is evident within the code itself.",
  "anomalies": "Typographical error in 'Write' response deserializer ('WriteRespose' instead of 'WriteResponse'). All methods raise 'NotImplementedError' with unimplemented method messages, indicating placeholder code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of auto-generated gRPC service classes and method handlers for protobuf services. All server methods are placeholders that raise 'NotImplementedError', and client stubs serialize and deserialize data for RPC calls. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are present. The typo in 'WriteRespose' might cause runtime errors but is not malicious. No external or secret data handling, malicious code injections, or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be an auto-generated scaffold for gRPC services with placeholder methods, without any malicious intent or security risks. The only issue is a typo that could cause runtime errors but does not relate to security concerns.",
