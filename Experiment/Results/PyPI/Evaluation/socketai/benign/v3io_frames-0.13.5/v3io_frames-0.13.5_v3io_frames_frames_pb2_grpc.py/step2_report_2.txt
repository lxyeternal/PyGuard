  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and the reasoning provided.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports identify that the code is auto-generated gRPC boilerplate for a 'Frames' service.\n- The server methods are placeholders raising `NotImplementedError`.\n- There are typographical errors in 'WriteRespose' instead of 'WriteResponse', which are likely code generation typos.\n- No evidence of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present.\n- The code handles protobuf serialization/deserialization and network communication in a standard way.\n- No data leaks, external system effects, or untrusted data flows are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The typo in 'WriteRespose' appears consistently across the code snippets. All server methods are unimplemented, which is typical for scaffolding but not malicious.\n\n- **Are there any errors or flaws?**  \n  The main flaw is the typo in 'WriteRespose', which could cause runtime errors if the method is invoked. This is likely an auto-generation typo, not malicious.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. Security risk scores are low (0 to 0.2), consistent with the code being boilerplate. The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Points:\n- **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Risk Scores Higher than 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign a risk above 0.2. Given the code is placeholder scaffolding with no logic, higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all recognize the code as generated boilerplate.\n\n- **Typographical errors ('WriteRespose')**:  \n  These are consistent across reports and are typical in generated code. They do not indicate malicious intent but could cause runtime errors if not corrected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be 0, as code is straightforward and generated.\n- **Risk Score:** Should be very low, around 0.0 to 0.1, since it's boilerplate code with no security issues.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0 (or at most 0.1 if considering the typo as a minor issue)\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll reports are consistent with the code being benign, auto-generated scaffolding for gRPC services. The only minor concern is the typo in 'WriteRespose', which should be corrected but does not impact security.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nThis code does not pose any security threat. It is standard generated code with a minor typo that should be fixed for runtime correctness but does not indicate malicious activity.",
