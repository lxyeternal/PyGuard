  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and consistency of the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a client API wrapper for a data frames service, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Justification:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The request objects are constructed from trusted parameters, and no suspicious behavior is observed.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with no signs of malicious activity. The focus is on standard client behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, consistent with the benign analysis.\n- **Justification:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The code constructs requests based on user inputs but does not execute or exfiltrate data.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles user inputs like 'query', 'filter', 'command', and 'args', which could be potential vectors for injection or misuse, but the code itself only constructs requests.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, considering potential misuse if backend validation is weak.\n- **Analysis:** The code accepts potentially untrusted parameters but does not execute them directly; it relies on backend validation. No signs of code injection or malicious payloads are present within this fragment.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. The potential for misuse exists but is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with no signs of malicious code. The code primarily prepares requests.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, aligned with standard client behavior.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior detected; the code handles inputs safely within its scope.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** The code acts as a client interface, with no malicious payloads or obfuscation. The only concern could be external parameters like 'session' and 'address', but no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** The code is a standard client wrapper, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code's analysis.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but all low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the potential for misuse if backend validation is weak, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n### Final estimation:\n\n**Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware in the code snippets.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk:** 0.1 — very low, given the nature of the code, but with a slight caveat regarding untrusted inputs.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' scores are reasonable and align with the detailed analysis. No adjustments are necessary. The code appears to be a standard, well-structured client SDK with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
