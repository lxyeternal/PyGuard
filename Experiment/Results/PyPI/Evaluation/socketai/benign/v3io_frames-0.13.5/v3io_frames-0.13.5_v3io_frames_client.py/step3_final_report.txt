{
  "purpose": "This code is a client SDK for a data frames service, constructing protobuf requests and managing connection parameters without executing untrusted code or network operations.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as 'backend', 'table', 'query', 'filter', 'command', 'args', 'session', and 'address' used to build request objects.",
  "sinks": "Request objects constructed from untrusted inputs; no direct data exfiltration or code execution observed within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into request construction methods, which are then sent via internal network calls (not shown). No untrusted data is executed or transmitted directly within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a client interface, converting parameters into protobuf request objects for data operations. It performs validation on inputs like 'backend' and 'table' but does not execute or transmit untrusted data directly. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present. The low malware and obfuscation scores (0) are justified, and the risk score (0.2) appropriately reflects minimal inherent security concern given its role as a request builder. The code's transparency and lack of malicious features support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured client SDK with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating a low security risk and no malware or obfuscation present.",
