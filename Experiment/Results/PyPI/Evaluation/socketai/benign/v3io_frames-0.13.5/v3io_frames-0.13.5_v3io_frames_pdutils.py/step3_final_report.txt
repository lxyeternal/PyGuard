  "purpose": "Utility functions for concatenating pandas DataFrames, aligning categorical data, and managing indices, primarily for data processing workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads input DataFrames, accesses DataFrame columns, index attributes, and pandas category data.",
  "sinks": "Modifies DataFrame structures in memory; no external data transmission or untrusted code execution detected.",
  "flows": "Reads DataFrames -> processes categories and indices -> constructs combined DataFrame -> sets index and labels attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Assignment to a non-standard attribute 'labels' on DataFrame, and deletion of 'index' column, but these are benign pandas operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard pandas DataFrame manipulations: concatenation, category alignment, index handling, and attribute setting. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The 'labels' attribute is a custom addition but not malicious. Warnings are suppressed during attribute assignment, which is common in data workflows. No suspicious patterns or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pandas utility module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports appears overly cautious; a score of 0 is more appropriate given the benign nature.",
