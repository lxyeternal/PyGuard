  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and ensure the scoring and reasoning are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurately describes a client for streaming frames data via HTTP, with data flowing through protobuf serialization/deserialization, network requests, and dataframes. No suspicious or malicious data flows are indicated.\n\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the use of `verify=False`, which is insecure but not malicious.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately identifies the code as a standard client with no malicious behavior. The security concern is configuration-related, not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, due to insecure SSL verification). These are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the API interaction and protobuf handling. No malicious activity or code injection is indicated.\n\n- **Anomalies:** Same insecure `verify=False` usage, but no malicious intent.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is a legitimate client, with the SSL verification issue being a security concern but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Describes a typical API client, with network requests and data serialization. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Anomalies:** Same insecure SSL verification, but no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies the code as standard, with the SSL verification issue being a security concern but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The reasoning is solid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to previous reports, standard client for data streaming, with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Anomalies:** Same insecure SSL verification, but no malicious intent.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly concludes the code is legitimate, with the SSL issue being a configuration concern.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3 (slightly higher, but still within reason considering the insecure SSL setting).\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The assessment is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Again, a typical client implementation with data flow through network requests and protobuf serialization. No malicious activity or backdoors are evident.\n\n- **Anomalies:** Same insecure SSL verification, but not malicious.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is legitimate, with the SSL verification being a security concern but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify actual malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code. All focus on standard API client behavior with insecure SSL verification, which is a configuration/security concern but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** All malware scores are 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code clarity. Risk scores are low (0.2-0.3), reflecting security concerns about SSL verification but not indicating high risk or malicious intent.\n\n- **Potential Discrepancies:** The scores are consistent with the reports' findings. The only common concern is `verify=False`, which is a security risk but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** (security concern due to insecure SSL verification, but not malicious)\n\nThis aligns with the overall analysis: the code is a standard, legitimate client library with a configuration security issue, but no malicious or harmful intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as a standard API client with a security misconfiguration rather than malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
