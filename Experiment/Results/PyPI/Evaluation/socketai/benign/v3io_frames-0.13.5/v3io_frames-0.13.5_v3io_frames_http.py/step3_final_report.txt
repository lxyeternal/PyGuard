  "purpose": "Client for frames stream API, handling data via network requests, protobuf serialization, and dataframes.",
  "sources": "Network responses, request parameters, protobuf deserialization.",
  "sinks": "Network calls, protobuf parsing, data processing functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and network responses flow through serialization/deserialization and dataframes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'verify=False' in requests, which disables SSL verification, representing a security misconfiguration but not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client for data streaming, with typical network handling, protobuf serialization, and error management. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The only security concern is the disabling of SSL verification, which exposes the client to man-in-the-middle attacks but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior. Obfuscation score is 0, as the code is straightforward. The security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting the insecure SSL configuration but not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard client library with a known security configuration issue (disabling SSL verification). There is no evidence of malware, sabotage, or obfuscation. The primary concern is the insecure SSL setting, which should be addressed but does not imply malicious intent.",
