  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard client for frames stream API; sources include network responses and parameters.\n- **Sinks:** Network calls, protobuf deserialization, data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No credentials; disables SSL verification (`verify=False`), which is insecure but not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Typical API client; no malicious behavior detected. The insecure SSL is a configuration issue, not an attack.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malware; security risk is low (0.2). Malware score: 0, Obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above; inputs are parameters and responses.\n- **Sinks:** HTTP requests, protobuf parsing.\n- **Anomalies:** Same insecure SSL (`verify=False`), no secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Standard client code; no malicious activity. SSL verification disabled is a security concern but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware, safe for use; malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Client for data management over HTTP.\n- **Sinks:** Network requests, serialization/deserialization.\n- **Anomalies:** `verify=False` disables SSL verification.\n- **Analysis:** Typical API client; no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware, security concern only in SSL verification; malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above; network responses and parameters.\n- **Sinks:** Network, protobuf, JSON.\n- **Anomalies:** `verify=False` again.\n- **Analysis:** Standard client code; no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, with a configuration security concern. Malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Data streaming client; parameters and responses.\n- **Sinks:** POST requests, protobuf, JSON.\n- **Anomalies:** `verify=False`.\n- **Analysis:** Typical data client; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware, just insecure SSL verification. Malware score: 0, obfuscated: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate standard client code with no malicious behavior. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risks:** The only common concern is the use of `verify=False`, which disables SSL verification, exposing to man-in-the-middle attacks. This is a security misconfiguration, not malicious code.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code is a typical, legitimate API client library.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n- The security risk stems from insecure SSL verification, which should be addressed but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n### Suggested scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.3 (security configuration issue, not malicious)\n\n**In conclusion, I would assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (due to insecure SSL verification, which is a known security concern but not malicious)\n\nThis analysis confirms the code is safe from a supply chain or malicious perspective, with the primary concern being a configuration security issue rather than code-based maliciousness.",
