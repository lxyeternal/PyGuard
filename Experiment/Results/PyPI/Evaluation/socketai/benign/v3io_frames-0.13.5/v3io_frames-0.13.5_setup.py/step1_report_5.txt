{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package called 'v3io_frames', used for packaging and distribution of the library.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'v3io_frames/__init__.py' for version, 'requirements.txt' and 'dev-requirements.txt' for dependencies, and 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink points that could lead to data leaks or code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "File contents are read into variables and passed into setup() configuration without execution of untrusted code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code. The code simply reads static files and sets up package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import setup() from setuptools or distutils, then defines functions to extract version info and dependencies from files. It reads version info from a specific file, dependencies from requirements files, and package description from README. The setup() call uses these values to configure the package. All operations are static file reads with no code execution or external inputs that could be malicious. There are no indications of malicious or maliciously crafted code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
