  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the v3io_frames Python library, including dependency management and metadata definitions.",
  "sources": "Reads the version info from v3io_frames/__init__.py, loads dependencies from requirements files, reads README.md for long description.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data from dependency files and version file, but they are static files and not user input; no direct sinks handling untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and dependencies from files, passes data to setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: reading version info, dependencies, and documentation. It handles dependency strings that may include git URLs with egg tags, which is common for dependencies hosted on GitHub. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or remote control. It does not execute untrusted code; all file reads are from local, controlled files. No suspicious network activity or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with no malicious intent. It properly manages dependencies and metadata without any suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
