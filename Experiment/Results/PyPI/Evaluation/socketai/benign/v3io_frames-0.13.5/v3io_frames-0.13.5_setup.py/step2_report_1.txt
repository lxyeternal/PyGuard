  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, considering the code, the context, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a standard Python setup script.\n- Reads version info from `v3io_frames/__init__.py`.\n- Loads dependencies from `requirements.txt` and `dev-requirements.txt`.\n- Reads `README.md` for long description.\n- Uses standard setup functions (`setuptools` or `distutils`).\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or obfuscated code.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code performs straightforward file reads and package setup; no issues are present in the code itself.\n\n### Flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The dependency parsing correctly ignores comments and blank lines.\n- Version extraction from `__init__.py` relies on a specific line containing `'__version__'`, which is standard practice.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. Given the code's nature, this is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 in the first report, but the others rate it as 0. This is reasonable since the script is static and controlled, with no malicious activity.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The only slight concern could be dependencies specified via git URLs with `#egg=` tags, which could, in theory, point to malicious repositories. However, this is a common practice for dependency management and does not indicate malicious intent by itself.\n- The code does not execute untrusted code; it merely reads static files.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment: the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- The scoring aligns with the code's nature: no malware, no obfuscation, minimal security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering dependency URLs, but the current reports set it at 0)\n\nGiven all this, I agree with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very minimal, mostly due to dependency sourcing practices, but not malicious)\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign setup script with no security concerns.**",
