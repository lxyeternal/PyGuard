  "purpose": "Set up configuration and dependencies for the Python package 'v3io_frames' including version extraction, dependencies loading, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading files: 'v3io_frames/__init__.py', 'requirements.txt', 'dev-requirements.txt', and 'README.md'. No untrusted input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function passing dependencies and metadata; no sink functions handling untrusted data in an unsafe manner.",
  "flows": "File reading (sources) → Processing dependencies and metadata → Passing to setup() as parameters. No untrusted data flow leading to insecure behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures observed. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors detected. The code performs standard package setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The script loads package version info from '__init__.py', dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and 'dev-requirements.txt', and package description from 'README.md'. It then calls setup() with these parameters, which is typical for Python package configuration. No code injection, malicious behaviors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. No external inputs are processed in a way that could lead to code execution or data leakage. All file reads are static and controlled.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard package setup tasks with no malicious intent or security risks. It safely loads metadata and dependencies without handling untrusted input or executing suspicious code.",
