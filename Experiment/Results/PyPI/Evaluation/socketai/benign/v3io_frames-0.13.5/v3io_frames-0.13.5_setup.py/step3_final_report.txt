  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging 'v3io_frames', extracting version info, dependencies, and description from static files.",
  "sources": "Reads version from '__init__.py', dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and 'dev-requirements.txt', description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows; static file reads only.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and passes data to setup(), with no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward package setup operations, including version extraction, dependency loading, and metadata assignment. It handles dependencies with git URLs using '#egg=' tags, which is common practice. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling is present. The version extraction relies on a specific line in '__init__.py', which is standard but could fail if malformed, though this does not impact security. Overall, the script is a benign, well-structured setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign Python setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The dependency sourcing practices are standard, and no suspicious patterns are present. The security risk and malware scores should remain at 0, with a very low risk score (~0.1) justified by the static nature of the script. All reports' assessments are accurate and consistent.",
