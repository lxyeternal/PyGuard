  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - Each class has a descriptive docstring explaining its purpose.\n   - The code includes a list `__all__` to specify exported classes.\n   - The licensing header is standard and does not contain any suspicious or obfuscated content.\n   - There are no external data inputs, outputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or any runtime logic.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n   - The code does not handle untrusted data, perform any operations, or contain any suspicious constructs.\n   - The exception classes are purely structural, serving as markers for error handling in a larger system.\n\n3. **Assessment of Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious elements.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, indicating high certainty based on the analysis.\n   - The malware scores are 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the straightforward, clear class definitions.\n   - The security risk scores are 0, as expected given the benign nature.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are reasonable and justified.\n   - No reason to adjust them upward; the code is a standard exception class module.\n\n5. **Potential Risks or Concerns:**\n   - Since the code is only defining exception classes, there is no attack surface or vulnerability.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here; the code is safe.\n\n6. **Overall Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a typical, well-structured set of custom exception definitions.\n   - No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The current scoring and analysis are accurate and appropriate.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The scores should remain as they are: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.\n- No further action needed; the code is safe and legitimate.\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the detailed review, the code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or suspicious elements. The current scores and analysis are justified and accurate.",
