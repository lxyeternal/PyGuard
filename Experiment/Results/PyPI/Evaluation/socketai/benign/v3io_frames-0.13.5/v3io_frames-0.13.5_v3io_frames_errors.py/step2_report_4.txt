  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - No external input, data processing, or dynamic behavior is present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are detected.\n   - The code appears purely structural and standard for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The summaries are thorough and align with the code content.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0, aligning with the reports.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n   - This is justified, as there is no malicious activity or code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They base their conclusions on the actual static analysis of the code.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable adjustments are needed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements are present.\n- The reports are accurate, comprehensive, and appropriately score the code.\n\n**My Final Estimation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
