{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a data or API processing context.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their associated docstrings, with no external data input sources.",
  "sinks": "None, as the code does not handle untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data or untrusted input flows through the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions for custom exceptions with descriptive docstrings. There are no external inputs, outputs, or data processing, and no use of dynamic or malicious constructs. The classes inherit from Python's built-in Exception class and serve as error markers. The code adheres to standard practices for exception definition. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling without any malicious or suspicious elements. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger software system and does not pose any security threat.",
