  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the v3io_frames context",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; no user input or environment variables used",
  "sinks": "No output, data leak, or system effects; no data transmission or logging to external systems observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines exception classes without any runtime logic",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors present",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with associated docstrings. It is purely structural, intended for use in larger systems for error handling. There are no imports, external calls, or logic that could be malicious. No obfuscation, suspicious variables, or code injection points are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for a Python library; no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and non-malicious.",
