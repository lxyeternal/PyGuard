  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code content verification:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class.\n   - No external data handling, input/output operations, network communication, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated/malicious constructs are present.\n   - The licensing comments are standard and do not pose security concerns.\n   - The classes serve as error markers with descriptive docstrings, typical for error handling modules.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n   - The code is clean, well-structured, and adheres to Python conventions.\n   - No signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Risk: 0 or 0.5\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n   - Since no malicious or suspicious behavior is detected, scores of 0 are justified.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - No justification is needed for higher scores, as the code does not introduce any security risks.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across reports.\n   - This is correct; the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly state that the code is purely structural, with no malicious intent or suspicious patterns.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is accurate.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content and the detailed analysis.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes. It does not pose any security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concerns. The reports' evaluations are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
