  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error types related to v3io_frames operations.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources are read; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted data as the code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code constructs, or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no dynamic execution, input handling, or network communication. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be part of a larger package to handle errors systematically. All classes inherit from Exception, and the structure is standard for defining custom errors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It does not perform any operations that could compromise security or contain obfuscated/malicious code.",
