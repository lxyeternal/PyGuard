  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`.\n   - All classes have descriptive docstrings indicating their purpose.\n   - The code includes a list `__all__` specifying exported class names.\n   - There are no external inputs, outputs, network operations, dynamic code execution, or data processing.\n   - The licensing comments are standard and do not introduce security concerns.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs.\n   - No malicious behaviors such as code injection, remote code execution, or data exfiltration.\n   - The code appears to be purely structural, intended for error handling within a larger system.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Potential Flaws or Misjudgments:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - No adjustments needed for scores.\n   - The reasoning in each report correctly dismisses any security concerns.\n\n5. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The code is a standard, benign module defining exception classes.\n   - No evidence of malicious intent or security risk.\n   - The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- Given the code's simplicity and standard pattern, there is no reason to assign higher scores.\n- The reports are thorough and justified in their conclusions.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a legitimate, non-malicious, and non-obfuscated set of exception class definitions. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
