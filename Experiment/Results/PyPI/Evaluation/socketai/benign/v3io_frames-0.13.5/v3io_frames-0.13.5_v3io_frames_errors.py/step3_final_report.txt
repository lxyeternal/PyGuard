{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for error handling in a larger system, providing specific error types for various failure scenarios.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only from the class definitions and the module's static structure; no external data or untrusted input is processed.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code only declares exception classes.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely establishes class hierarchies for error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, with standard class definitions and no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from Python's Exception, with descriptive docstrings and an __all__ list. It contains no external input handling, network operations, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. The code is a standard pattern for error handling modules. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are consistent with the code's content and purpose, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The existing reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
