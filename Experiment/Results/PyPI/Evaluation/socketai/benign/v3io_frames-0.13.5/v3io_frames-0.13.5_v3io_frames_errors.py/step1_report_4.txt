  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to v3io_frames operations",
  "sources": "None; this code does not read external input or data",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data outputs or sensitive data leaks",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink exists",
  "anomalies": "The code solely consists of class definitions for exceptions with no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from built-in Exception classes, with descriptive docstrings. It includes only standard class declarations and a list of exported class names. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks present.",
