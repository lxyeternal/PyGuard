  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to v3io_frames operations.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input or data; it only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data is processed or leaked.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with descriptive docstrings. It contains no external data handling, network operations, dynamic code execution, or any behavior that could indicate malicious intent. There are no suspicious variables, obfuscated parts, or unusual language features. The licensing comments at the top are standard and do not pose security issues. Overall, this is a straightforward module for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
