  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is straightforward class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - No external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hardcoded secrets.\n   - The code adheres to standard practices for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with confidence levels of 1.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No inconsistencies or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the straightforward code.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the analysis.\n   - The high confidence levels (1) are justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No issues warrant a risk score above 0.5 since there's no malicious activity, vulnerability, or suspicious behavior.\n   - The code is purely structural and intended for error handling.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports.\n   - No malicious behavior is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as benign.\n   - No unwarranted concerns are raised.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - They accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions.\n- No security issues, obfuscation, or malware are present.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\nThe code is entirely benign, serving as part of a larger system's error handling mechanism.
