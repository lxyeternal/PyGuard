{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'query' from the current package, likely for internal use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local package (__init__.py or similar).",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows present in the snippet; import statement alone does not create data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement from the same package, which is a common practice in modular Python code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hardcoded credentials. The snippet is too minimal to indicate any malicious intent or security risks. No external data sources or sinks are involved. Without additional context or code, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement with no indication of malicious activity or security issues. It does not perform any harmful actions and is typical for modular Python code.",
