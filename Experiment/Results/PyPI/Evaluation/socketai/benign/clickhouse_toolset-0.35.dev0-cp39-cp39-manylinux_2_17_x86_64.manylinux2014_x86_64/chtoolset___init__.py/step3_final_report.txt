  "purpose": "Minimal import statement of a local module 'query' within a Python package.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from . import query' reads the local module 'query' from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "The source (import statement) loads the 'query' module; no data flows or execution paths to external systems are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import, standard in Python packages. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration. The minimal nature and lack of suspicious patterns support a benign assessment. All reports correctly identify the benign intent, with high confidence scores and zero malware/security risk scores. No anomalies or obfuscation are present. The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious or insecure.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is harmless, representing a standard import statement with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
