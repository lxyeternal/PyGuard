{
  "purpose": "Import the 'query' module from the same package directory, likely for further processing or functionality.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is a source, bringing in external code into this module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present, as this is a single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a simple relative import, which is standard and not suspicious by itself. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a relative module named 'query'. It does not perform any operations, data processing, or network activity. Given the minimal and standard nature of this code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The import could be used in further code, but with this snippet alone, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. It is standard practice in Python projects.",
