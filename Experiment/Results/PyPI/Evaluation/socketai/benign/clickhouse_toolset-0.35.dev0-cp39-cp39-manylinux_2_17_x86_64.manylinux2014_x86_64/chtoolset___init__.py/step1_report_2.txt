  "anomalies": "Single import statement with relative import; no apparent anomalies or suspicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement from the current package. It does not process input, execute functions, or handle data. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The import appears standard for Python packages and does not involve any network activity or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple relative import of a module named 'query' and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical package structure statement with no suspicious activity.",
