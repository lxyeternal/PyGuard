  "purpose": "Import functions related to query processing, formatting, caching, and analysis from the internal module 'chtoolset._query'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing multiple functions from 'chtoolset._query'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only imports functions without executing or passing data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; import statement does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard import syntax, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from an internal module, with functions related to database query handling. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The functions' names suggest legitimate query processing tasks. The code does not perform any execution or data transmission. The import of internal modules is common and not inherently malicious. The high confidence scores reflect the benign nature of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
