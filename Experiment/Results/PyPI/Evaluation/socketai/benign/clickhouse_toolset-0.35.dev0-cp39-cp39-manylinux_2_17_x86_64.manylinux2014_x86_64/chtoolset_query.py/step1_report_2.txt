{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions and variables from the 'chtoolset._query' module, likely to perform database query manipulations, formatting, and analysis.",
  "sources": "The import statement retrieves functions and variables from the 'chtoolset._query' module; no external data input is shown in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "None evident in this code snippet; it only imports functions and variables, no untrusted data handling or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is applicable here as no data processing or handling is demonstrated in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "This code solely performs an import of multiple functions and variables from a module. It appears to be part of a larger codebase. The functions imported suggest database query handling, formatting, and analysis functionalities. There are no indications of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious activity within this snippet. No external inputs, network operations, or data outputs are present that could be exploited or used maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward import statement that by itself shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a larger codebase where these imported functions are used elsewhere. Based on this snippet alone, there are no security concerns.",
