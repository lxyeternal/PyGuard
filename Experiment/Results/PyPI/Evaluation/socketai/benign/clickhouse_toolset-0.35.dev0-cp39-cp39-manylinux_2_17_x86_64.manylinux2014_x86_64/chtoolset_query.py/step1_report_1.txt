  "purpose": "Import specific functions from the 'chtoolset._query' module, likely for database query manipulation or analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing functions from the 'chtoolset._query' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks are evident in this snippet; the imported functions may be used elsewhere to process data.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are present within this snippet; it only imports functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard import statement with no unusual syntax, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The imported functions' names suggest database query processing tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple functions from a module named 'chtoolset._query'. The underscore prefix indicates that '_query' may be a private or internal module. The function names suggest operations related to SQL query formatting, table management, query analysis, and caching. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data exfiltration in these import statements. Without further context or usage, no malicious behavior or security issues are detectable in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement for functions related to query processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code fragment. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger codebase intended for database query manipulation.",
