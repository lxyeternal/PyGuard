{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions from the 'chtoolset._query' module, likely for query manipulation and analysis.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'chtoolset._query' module, which could include both safe functions and potentially sensitive operations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted data. It is purely an import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable from the provided snippet since it only imports functions; there are no source-to-sink flows demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The import syntax is standard; no obfuscation or unusual patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of functions from a specific internal module, likely related to query processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. Since the code only imports functions and does not execute or manipulate data directly, it presents minimal risk. No evidence of obfuscation or suspicious patterns is observed. The functions imported seem related to query handling, which by itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet is a standard import statement with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger codebase that handles database queries, with no malicious behavior evident in this isolated snippet.",
