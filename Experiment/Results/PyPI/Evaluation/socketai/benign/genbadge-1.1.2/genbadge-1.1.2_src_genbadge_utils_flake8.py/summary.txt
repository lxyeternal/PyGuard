  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for report parsing and badge creation, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The current malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The risk score, currently at 0.2 in some reports, could be lowered to 0.1 given the absence of active malicious code, but remains acceptable. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for supply chain use."
