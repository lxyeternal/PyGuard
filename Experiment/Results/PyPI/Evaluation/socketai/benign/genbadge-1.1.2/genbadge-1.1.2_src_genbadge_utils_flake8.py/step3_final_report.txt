  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing flake8 reports and generating badges based on report severity.",
  "sources": "Reads report files or streams, regex matching lines for severity counts, optional dependency imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Reads input -> parses report lines -> updates severity counts -> generates badge with severity info.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out HTML parsing code involving BeautifulSoup, but inactive and harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, handling dependencies safely, parsing report data with regex, and generating badges. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The commented-out HTML parser is inert and does not affect execution. The fallback class raises ImportError intentionally for missing dependencies, which is benign. The overall structure and logic are standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for report parsing and badge creation, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The current malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The risk score, currently at 0.2 in some reports, could be lowered to 0.1 given the absence of active malicious code, but remains acceptable. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for supply chain use.",
