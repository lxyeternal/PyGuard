  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for dependency management with no malicious or obfuscated components. The low security risk score is justified, primarily reflecting the inherent risks in executing package installations based on external inputs, which is standard for such scripts. Overall, the assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."
