{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for installing Python project requirements using different configuration files and environments, including support for conda and pip, and includes utility functions for file and folder removal.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg) and environment variables, and uses session methods for package installation and file removal functions.",
  "sinks": "Installation functions call session.install and session.conda_install, which execute package installations. File removal functions os.remove and shutil.rmtree are used for deleting files and directories.",
  "flows": "Configuration reading (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg) -> determine requirements and conda/pip installation -> session.install/session.conda_install or file deletion functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious variable names. All functions serve typical build/deployment purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily facilitates dependency installation and file management for Python projects, including optional conda support and version constraints. It reads configuration files, interprets requirements, and installs packages accordingly. The code contains no network calls, data exfiltration, or system manipulation beyond file deletion, which is standard for setup scripts. No malicious behaviors such as backdoors or hidden code are present. The usage of standard libraries and practices appears benign. No anomalies or indicators of supply chain attacks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical dependency management and utility script for Python project setup, with no malicious intent or malicious behaviors detected. It performs standard operations related to package installation and file removal without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
