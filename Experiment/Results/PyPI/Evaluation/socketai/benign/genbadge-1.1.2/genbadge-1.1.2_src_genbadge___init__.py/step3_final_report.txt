{
  "purpose": "Initialize package versioning and expose public API symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements for version info and Badge class, reading from _version.py or setuptools_scm.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file operations beyond imports.",
  "flows": "Version info source (file or git) to __version__; Badge class imported for use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard version management and import pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical __init__.py for a Python package, handling version retrieval via _version.py or setuptools_scm, and exposing symbols. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or security issues are present. Reports are empty, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The code's logic is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package initialization code with no detected security risks or malicious intent. The empty reports do not indicate any issues. Scores should be set to zero across malware, obfuscation, and risk categories.",
