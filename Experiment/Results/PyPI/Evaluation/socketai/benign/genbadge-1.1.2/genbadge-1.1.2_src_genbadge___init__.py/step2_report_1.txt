  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if reported issues are present in the code**\n\nAll reports are empty responses with no details. Therefore, I cannot identify any specific issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior based on the provided reports.\n\n**Step 2: Review the code for potential issues**\n\nThe code appears to be a standard `__init__.py` file for a Python package, handling versioning and imports:\n\n- It imports `Badge` from `.utils_badge`.\n- It attempts to import `version` from `_version.py`, generated during build.\n- If that fails, it uses `setuptools_scm` to get the version from Git.\n- It defines `__all__` with relevant symbols.\n\nNothing suspicious or malicious stands out in this code. It looks like typical package setup code.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the scores and claims**\n\nSince no reports contain details, I cannot evaluate or justify any risk, malware, or obfuscation scores. All scores should remain at zero unless new evidence appears.\n\n**Step 4: Critical assessment**\n\n- The code does not perform any network activity, file manipulation beyond imports, or execute any suspicious logic.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code is present.\n- The versioning logic is standard and safe.\n\n**Step 5: Final judgment**\n\nGiven the lack of information and the code's straightforward nature, I conclude:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no evident security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The reports are empty; no issues can be identified.\n- The code is standard, safe, and does not contain vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- Scores should remain at zero across all categories.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nMonitor future reports for any detailed issues. For now, no action needed.",
