{
  "purpose": "The script checks if the current Python runtime version matches a specified expected version provided as a command-line argument.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "The script outputs messages to standard output and raises exceptions which could be exploited if manipulated, but primarily it processes the version check logic.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv[1] is parsed into a tuple of integers; based on the version info from sys.version_info, the script performs comparisons and outputs a success message if versions match or raises errors if they do not.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward version comparison with no hidden or unusual behavior. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The script takes a single argument representing an expected version string, parses it into a tuple, and compares it against the current Python interpreter version. It raises descriptive errors if parsing fails or if versions do not match. The logic is standard and intended for environment validation. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or sabotage. The output is solely informational, indicating a match or mismatch.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version check utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply verifies runtime version compatibility and reports success or failure. There are no anomalies or suspicious operations present.",
