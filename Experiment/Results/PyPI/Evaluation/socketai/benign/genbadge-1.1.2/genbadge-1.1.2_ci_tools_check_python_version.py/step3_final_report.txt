  "purpose": "A utility script to validate that the current Python interpreter version matches a specified version string provided as a command-line argument.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), specifically the version string input.",
  "sinks": "Uses exception raising and printing; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input argument (version string) is parsed into a tuple, then compared to sys.version_info; mismatches trigger exceptions, success results in a print statement.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward version validation logic with proper exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, transparent version validation utility. It reads a version string argument, parses it into integers, and compares each component to the current Python version. It raises exceptions if parsing fails or if any version component does not match, otherwise prints a success message. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. The logic is correct, and the code uses standard libraries only. The minimal security risk arises from raising exceptions based on user input, which is typical for validation scripts. No external data flows, network activity, or code injection are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward version validation utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report slightly overstates the negligible risk involved in exception handling based on user input. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use.",
