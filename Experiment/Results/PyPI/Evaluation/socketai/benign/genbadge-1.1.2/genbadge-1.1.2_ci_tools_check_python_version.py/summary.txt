  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward version validation utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report slightly overstates the negligible risk involved in exception handling based on user input. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use."
