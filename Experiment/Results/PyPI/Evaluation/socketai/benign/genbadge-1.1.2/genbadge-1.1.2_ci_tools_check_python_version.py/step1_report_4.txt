{
  "purpose": "The script verifies that the current Python interpreter version matches an expected version provided as an argument.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line argument (sys.argv[1]) for the expected version string, and sys.version_info for the current Python version.",
  "sinks": "Outputs success or raises exceptions based on version checks; no data leaks or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument is parsed and checked against sys.version_info to confirm version match; flow is straightforward and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The version check is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code only reads input from command-line arguments and system version info, both trusted sources. It performs parsing, validation, and comparison operations without executing external code, dynamic eval, or network activity. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. Its sole purpose is to confirm the Python interpreter version matches a specified version, with proper exception handling. No security risks or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version verification script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs straightforward input validation and comparison, with no suspicious or harmful behavior.",
