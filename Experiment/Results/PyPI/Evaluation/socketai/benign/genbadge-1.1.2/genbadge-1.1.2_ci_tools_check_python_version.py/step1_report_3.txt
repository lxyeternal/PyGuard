  "purpose": "The script verifies if the current Python interpreter's version matches an expected version specified as a command-line argument.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; reads sys.version_info for current Python version",
  "sinks": "Uses the expected version string for comparison; raises exceptions and prints output based on conditions",
  "flows": "Command-line input (sys.argv) influences validation logic; version info (sys.version_info) used for comparisons",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior present. Uses standard libraries only.",
  "analysis": "The code processes a single command-line argument intended to specify a Python version, parses it into a tuple, and compares it with the current runtime version. It raises exceptions if input parsing fails or if version components do not match. The logic is straightforward and solely related to version checking. No external data, network activity, or system modifications are present. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a version check utility without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It employs standard Python features for input validation and output reporting. No malware or security risks identified.",
