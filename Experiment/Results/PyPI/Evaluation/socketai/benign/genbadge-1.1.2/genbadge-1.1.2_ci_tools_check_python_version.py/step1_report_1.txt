  "purpose": "The script validates if the current Python interpreter version matches an expected version provided as a command-line argument.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) for the expected version string.",
  "sinks": "Outputs a success message to standard output; raises exceptions on errors.",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv is parsed, validated, and used to compare against sys.version_info. No data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by checking the number of command-line arguments. It parses the version string into a tuple of integers, handling exceptions if parsing fails. It then compares the provided version components against the current Python version, raising assertions if mismatched. If all checks pass, it prints a success message. The logic is straightforward and does not include any malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign version validation utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs input validation and simple comparison logic to ensure Python version consistency.",
