{
  "purpose": "The script verifies that the current Python interpreter version matches a specified version provided as a command-line argument.",
  "sources": "The code reads the command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "The script raises exceptions and prints output; no external data sinks are involved",
  "flows": "Input from sys.argv is parsed and used for version comparison; control flow depends on argument validation and version checks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious instructions observed",
  "analysis": "The script accepts a version string argument, parses it into a tuple of integers, and compares it against the current sys.version_info. It raises errors if arguments are missing, improperly formatted, or if the version does not match. The code contains straightforward version validation logic with no external network calls, no data leaks, and no dynamic code execution. The code’s purpose appears to be a simple version check utility without malicious intent or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version verification script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected validation functions and provides informative error messages. No malware or security threats are present.",
