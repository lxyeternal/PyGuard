  "purpose": "Configure package setup, manage versioning via setuptools_scm, and invoke setup() with minimal configuration.",
  "sources": "Version requirement checks, get_version() from setuptools_scm, URL construction using version info.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication beyond URL construction, which is deterministic.",
  "flows": "Version info retrieved -> URL constructed -> setup() invoked with minimal args.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward build script with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: verifying dependencies, retrieving version info from setuptools_scm, constructing a download URL, and calling setup() with minimal arguments. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The version handling and URL construction are deterministic and typical for Python package configuration. Minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified by the dynamic URL but does not indicate actual vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, safe setup configuration with no malicious intent or security issues. All assessments correctly identify the benign nature. The slight security risk score of 0.1 is acceptable and can be considered negligible. Overall, the code is secure, non-obfuscated, and free of malicious behavior.",
