  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code is a set of straightforward variable assignments:\n     ```python\n     __version__ = version = '1.1.2'\n     __version_tuple__ = version_tuple = (1, 1, 2)\n     ```\n   - These are static, hardcoded values representing the package version.\n   - The comments indicate the code is auto-generated by setuptools_scm and customized, with explicit instructions not to modify or track in version control.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, external interactions, or dynamic behaviors.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or code execution.\n   - No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.\n   - The comments and structure are typical for version metadata files.\n   - No obfuscation, code injection, or hidden behavior is evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious activity.\n   - The reasoning that this is standard version declaration code is sound.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws**:\n   - The reports are thorough and correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n   - The comments and code align with typical practices for version metadata.\n\n5. **Any Recommendations for Score Adjustments?**\n   - Since the code is static, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, the scores seem appropriate.\n   - The risk score of 0 is justified.\n   - Malware risk remains at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - Obfuscation is correctly marked as 0.\n\n6. **Overall Justification**:\n   - The code is purely informational, serving as version metadata.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- The code is safe, benign, and standard for package versioning.\n- The scores are appropriate; no changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.",
