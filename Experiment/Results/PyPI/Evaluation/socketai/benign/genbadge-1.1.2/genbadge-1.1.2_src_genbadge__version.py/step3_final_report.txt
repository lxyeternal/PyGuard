{
  "purpose": "The code defines version information variables for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, serving as metadata.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments (__version__, __version_tuple__) with no external data input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignments do not involve source-to-sink data paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with comments indicating auto-generation, and contains no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static version declaration with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or malicious patterns. Comments confirm auto-generation, and the structure is typical for package metadata. No data flows, sinks, or anomalies are present. The code does not perform any operations beyond variable assignments, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are accurate and justified based on the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and serves as version metadata. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
