  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - The code consists solely of variable assignments:\n     ```python\n     __version__ = version = '1.1.2'\n     __version_tuple__ = version_tuple = (1, 1, 2)\n     ```\n   - Comments indicate that the code is auto-generated by `setuptools_scm` and customized, with instructions not to change or track in version control.\n   - There are no functions, data inputs, outputs, external interactions, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, data processing, or security-sensitive operations.\n\n2. **Assessment of Each Report:**\n   - All reports agree that this is standard version declaration code, generated by a packaging tool, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of sinks, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis that there is no malicious activity.\n\n3. **Potential Flaws or Issues:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no flaws or logical errors are evident.\n   - The comments about the code being auto-generated are correct and do not imply obfuscation or malicious intent.\n   - The code's purpose is purely informational, serving as version metadata.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified; no malicious code is present.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The security risk score of 0 is justified; no security risks are introduced by this code.\n\n5. **Final Recommendations:**\n   - The scores assigned in each report are reasonable and consistent.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a simple, standard version declaration snippet generated by `setuptools_scm`.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that this code is benign and typical for package versioning metadata.",
