  "purpose": "Define package version information generated by setuptools_scm",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version and version_tuple variables",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs are used",
  "flows": "None; simple variable assignments without data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns version information to variables with static string and tuple values. It includes a comment about its origin and instructions not to modify or track in version control. There are no external data inputs, no code execution, and no dynamic or obfuscated behavior. The structure is straightforward and typical for version declaration files.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version declaration snippet with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
