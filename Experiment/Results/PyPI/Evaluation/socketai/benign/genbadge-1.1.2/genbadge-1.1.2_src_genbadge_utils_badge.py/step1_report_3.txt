{
  "purpose": "The code generates SVG badges, either locally or from Shields.io, for display purposes, with support for custom text and colors.",
  "sources": "Input data includes badge text (left_txt, right_txt), color, and optional paths or streams for saving the SVG. Data is also fetched from package resources (template SVG).",
  "sinks": "SVG string output, file writing, and HTTP request response handling (requests.get).",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into SVG template replacements or URL encoding; HTTP responses from requests flow into return values; file paths and streams are written to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of requests for external HTTP request is controlled within a function, with URL encoding applied. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. External resource access is limited to badge images, and the package resource usage is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation for badge generation, utilizing local templates, external shields.io for badge images, and writing output to files or streams. External HTTP requests are limited to badge images, with proper URL encoding to prevent injection. File system interactions include directory creation and writing SVG content. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are evident. The external request usage is benign in context, and no hidden or obfuscated code is present. The code handles dependencies securely, and resource access appears standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate badge generator with no malicious intent. It does use external HTTP requests for badge images, but this is expected for dynamic badge creation. There are no indicators of malware, data theft, or sabotage. The overall security risk is low.",
