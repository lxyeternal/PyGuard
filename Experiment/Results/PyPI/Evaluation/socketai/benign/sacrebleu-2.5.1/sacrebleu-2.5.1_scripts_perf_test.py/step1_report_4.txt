{
  "purpose": "The script performs performance testing of the SacreBLEU metric implementation by computing scores on system output files against reference files, measuring execution time, and printing statistical summaries.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from specified system output files and reference files located in the 'data/wmt17-submitted-data/txt/' directory.",
  "sinks": "Print statements output timing and performance metrics to stdout; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reads file contents into memory, processes data using sacrebleu metrics, then outputs timing and statistical results.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code performs standard benchmarking procedures without hidden or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and sacrebleu libraries, reads predefined files containing translation outputs and references, and measures BLEU and CHRF metrics. It caches references for efficiency, computes scores, and outputs timing statistics. There are no signs of malicious activities such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward performance testing script for evaluation metrics. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malware indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a benchmarking utility for sacrebleu metric performance measurement. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms. It is a safe, standard evaluation script with no security concerns.",
