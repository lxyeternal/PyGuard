{
  "purpose": "The script measures the performance of various BLEU and CHRF metrics on system output files against reference translations, outputting timing statistics.",
  "sources": "Reads system output files from specified paths and reference translation files.",
  "sinks": "No significant sinks; no untrusted data is written or executed beyond reading files.",
  "flows": "Reads input files -> Processes data with metric objects -> Prints timing information; no untrusted data passed to external commands or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. Usage of file paths appears standard; no obfuscated or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code loads system and reference files, initializes multiple metric objects with different parameters, and measures their performance. File reading is straightforward without input validation or sanitization concerns. Metrics are instantiated and used locally; no external network connections or data exfiltration observed. The code employs standard libraries and methods; no malicious patterns such as system manipulation, code injection, or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign performance testing script for evaluating translation metrics. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code operates within expected bounds for such a utility.",
