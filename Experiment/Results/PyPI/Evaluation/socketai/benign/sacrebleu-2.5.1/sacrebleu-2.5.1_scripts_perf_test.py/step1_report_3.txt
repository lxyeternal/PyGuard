{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to evaluate translation system outputs using metrics like BLEU and CHRF on specific datasets.",
  "sources": "Reads system output files and reference files from disk, loads modules, and retrieves sacrebleu version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input in a way that could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "Reads data from files -> Processes data with metrics classes -> Outputs scores and durations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code loads standard modules and third-party sacrebleu library. It reads data files into lists, performs metric calculations in loops, and prints timing info. The usage of sacrebleu classes and functions appears straightforward and does not involve malicious behavior. No indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. All operations involve local file reading and in-memory computations. No code injection, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard evaluation script for translation metrics without malicious intent. It safely reads data, processes it, and outputs performance metrics. There are no signs of malware or security risks in the provided code.",
