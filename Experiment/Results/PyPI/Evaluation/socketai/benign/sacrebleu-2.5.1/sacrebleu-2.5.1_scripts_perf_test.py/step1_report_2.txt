{
  "purpose": "The script performs evaluation of machine translation outputs using various BLEU and CHRF metrics, measuring their performance and timing.",
  "sources": "Reads translation system outputs and reference translations from specified files.",
  "sinks": "Outputs timing and scoring results to stdout; no untrusted data is written to files or network.",
  "flows": "Reads file contents -> computes metrics -> prints results; no untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets. Uses standard libraries for timing and statistics. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code loads multiple translation output files and reference files, computes several BLEU and CHRF metrics with different options, and measures execution time for each system. It utilizes standard libraries and the sacrebleu package for metric calculation. No external network communication, no hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code performs straightforward evaluation tasks without suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate evaluation script for translation metrics with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads input files, calculates metrics, and outputs results.",
