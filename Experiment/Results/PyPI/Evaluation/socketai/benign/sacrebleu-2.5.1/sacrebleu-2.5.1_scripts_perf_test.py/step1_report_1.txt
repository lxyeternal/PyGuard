{
  "purpose": "The script performs performance evaluation of translation system outputs using metrics like BLEU and CHRF, reading input data from specified files and computing scores multiple times.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from files specified in 'sys_files' and 'ref_files'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities; no network or file modifications based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads files (sources) and processes the data through metric computations (sinks). There are no untrusted data flows leading to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no code obfuscation, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports open-source libraries, reads input files, and performs metric calculations for BLEU and CHRF scores. It measures performance timing for each metric computation. All file paths are hardcoded, but they are static resource references rather than dynamic or user-controlled inputs. No external network activity, code injection, or suspicious data handling is present. The code appears to be a straightforward performance evaluation script without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign performance testing utility for language translation evaluation metrics. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior and poses no security risks. No anomalies or suspicious activities are observed.",
