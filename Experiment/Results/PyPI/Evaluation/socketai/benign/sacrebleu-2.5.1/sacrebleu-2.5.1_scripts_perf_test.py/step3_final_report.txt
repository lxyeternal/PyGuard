  "purpose": "Performance evaluation of translation metrics (BLEU, CHRF) using static files, with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reading static files containing system outputs and references.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication involved.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> computing metrics -> outputting scores and timing statistics.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward file reading and metric calculation.",
  "analysis": "The code reads local files containing translation outputs and references, performs metric calculations (BLEU, CHRF), measures execution times, and outputs statistical summaries. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted input beyond static file reading. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The code is standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward performance benchmarking utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior. The only adjustment needed is to set the security risk score in Report 3 from 0.1 to 0, as no actual security concern exists.",
