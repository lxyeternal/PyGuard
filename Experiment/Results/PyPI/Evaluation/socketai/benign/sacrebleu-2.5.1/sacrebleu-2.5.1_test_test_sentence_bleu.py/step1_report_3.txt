{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test cases for the sacrebleu Python library, specifically testing the BLEU score calculation methods with various parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads predefined strings REF, SYS, REF_0, SYS_0, and parameters supplied to the test functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted input or data; the code does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "The test functions call sacrebleu methods with fixed inputs; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code appears straightforward and typical of a test suite.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pytest and sacrebleu modules, defines test data, and uses parameterized tests to verify the BLEU score calculations. It employs standard testing practices without dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns. No external data inputs or outputs are handled beyond library function calls. The sacrebleu library is a known open-source package for BLEU score evaluation, and no suspicious behavior is evident in the test code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard test suite for sacrebleu's BLEU score functions, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It operates solely on fixed data and library functions, making it safe.",
