{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the sacrebleu library, specifically testing BLEU score calculations with various smoothing and tokenization methods.",
  "sources": "Input data such as SYS, REF, REF_0, SYS_0, and test case parameters; also imports from pytest and sacrebleu libraries.",
  "sinks": "Score calculations and assertions; no untrusted data sinks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (REF, SYS, test parameters) are fed into sacrebleu functions and class methods to compute BLEU scores, which are then compared with expected values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network connections. Test code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily test functions verifying the sacrebleu library's BLEU score calculations under different configurations. It uses parameterized tests with fixed input data and expected outputs. The code imports known libraries for testing and BLEU scoring, with no suspicious or malicious logic detected. There are no input sources that could be exploited maliciously, and the sinks are only for in-memory calculations and assertions. No anomalous behavior, external communications, or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless test suite for the sacrebleu library with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely performs in-memory calculations and assertions on fixed input data.",
