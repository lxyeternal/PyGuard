{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the sacrebleu library, verifying BLEU score calculations with various parameters and fixed input data.",
  "sources": "Fixed input strings REF, SYS, REF_0, SYS_0 used in score calculations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or outputs; all computations are in-memory.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed by sacrebleu's BLEU functions to produce scores; no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard testing practices with fixed, controlled data. It imports well-known libraries (pytest, sacrebleu) and performs straightforward assertions on expected BLEU scores. No external system interactions, network calls, or malicious patterns are present. The code structure is clear, and the purpose is solely to validate library functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for sacrebleu, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, reflecting its safe and controlled nature.",
