{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the BLEU score calculation functions from the sacrebleu library with various parameters.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'pytest' testing framework and 'sacrebleu' library; reads test case parameters and expected results; inputs are test strings REF, SYS, and test case parameters.",
  "sinks": "None of the code appears to process untrusted data for effects such as system commands, network access, or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Test parameters are fed into sacrebleu's functions, which perform BLEU score computations without external data flows or untrusted sources affecting system state.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code constructs are present; the code appears to be straightforward testing code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines test data, and employs parameterized pytest functions to test BLEU score calculations. It uses fixed reference and system strings, with expected BLEU scores for validation. There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious data handling. The use of sacrebleu's functions is consistent with normal testing practices. No hidden backdoors, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for sacrebleu's BLEU scoring functions, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs controlled computations and assertions within a testing environment.",
