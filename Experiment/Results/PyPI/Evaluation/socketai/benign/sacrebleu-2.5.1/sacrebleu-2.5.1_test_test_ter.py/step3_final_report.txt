  "purpose": "A Python test suite using pytest to evaluate sacrebleu's TER metric with static test cases, including perfect matches, no overlap, empty strings, and shifted sequences.",
  "sources": "Static test data within the code, imported libraries (pytest, sacrebleu)",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or data leaks; purely in-memory tests",
  "flows": "Input test cases flow into sacrebleu's TER metric functions, with results compared against expected scores",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, static test data and no suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit testing script for sacrebleu's TER metric, with no external dependencies or malicious behavior. It uses static data, performs simple assertions, and contains no obfuscation or security-sensitive operations. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The code does not perform any network activity, data leaks, or system modifications. The scores are consistent with the code's functionality and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test suite for sacrebleu's TER metric, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores of 0 across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
