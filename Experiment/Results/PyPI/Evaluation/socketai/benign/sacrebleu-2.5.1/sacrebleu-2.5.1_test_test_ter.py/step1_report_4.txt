{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the translation error rate (TER) metric implementation using the sacrebleu library with various test cases.",
  "sources": "Code reads hardcoded test cases defined within the script; no external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted input or output sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded test cases through the sacrebleu metric calculations to assertions in the test functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code uses standard testing and library functions; no obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing and sacrebleu libraries, defines multiple test cases, and executes tests on sacrebleu's TER metric implementation. All data are hardcoded within the script. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, or network activities. The structure is typical for unit testing with pytest. No suspicious or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward unit test for sacrebleu's TER metric, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only contains benign testing code and library usage.",
