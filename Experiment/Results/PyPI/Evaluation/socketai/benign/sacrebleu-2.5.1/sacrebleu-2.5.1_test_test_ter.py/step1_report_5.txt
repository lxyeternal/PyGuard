{
  "purpose": "The code defines test cases using pytest for evaluating translation quality metrics (specifically TER) with the sacrebleu library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input hypotheses and reference translations from predefined lists within the test cases.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network operations; no untrusted data outputs or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input hypotheses and references are passed into sacrebleu's TER metric for scoring; no data flow outside this scope.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code uses standard pytest structure, standard library imports, and sacrebleu metrics.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only well-known libraries (pytest and sacrebleu). It defines several test cases for evaluating translation metrics, including edge cases like empty strings and typical translation scenarios. The test function uses sacrebleu's TER metric to compute scores based on the hypotheses and references. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is purely for testing purposes with no external data transmissions or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of test cases for the sacrebleu library's TER metric, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe, with no anomalous or suspicious behavior observed.",
