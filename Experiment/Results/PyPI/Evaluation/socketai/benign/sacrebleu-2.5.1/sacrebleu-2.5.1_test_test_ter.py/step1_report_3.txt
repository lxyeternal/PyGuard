{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform testing of the sacrebleu library's TER (Translation Edit Rate) metric implementation using pytest, by running multiple test cases to verify correctness.",
  "sources": "Code reads static data from test_cases array, imports pytest and sacrebleu libraries, and accesses their functions and classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted, and no external systems or data leaks are involved.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing libraries to defining test data, then executing tests that calculate metric scores based on static input data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures are present. The code is straightforward, with no hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only well-known libraries (pytest and sacrebleu) used for testing and metric calculation. Test data is static and hardcoded within the script, with no external input or environment variables involved. The test function performs a calculation of BLEU TER scores and asserts correctness, with no evidence of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behavior. There are no suspicious network calls, file manipulations, or secret handling. The code appears to be a standard test suite for verifying sacrebleu's functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test script for a common open-source NLP library, with no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
