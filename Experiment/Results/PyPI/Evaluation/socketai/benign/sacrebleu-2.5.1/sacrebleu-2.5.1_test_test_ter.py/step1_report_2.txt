{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of test cases for evaluating translation quality using the sacrebleu library and pytest framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads static test data from the 'test_cases' list; imports external libraries 'pytest' and 'sacrebleu'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks that could lead to data leaks or security issues are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static test case definitions into the test function, with no external or untrusted data sources or outputs involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The code uses standard testing libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports well-known libraries (pytest and sacrebleu) for testing and BLEU score computation, respectively. It defines test cases with static data, including special cases like empty strings and shifted sequences. The test function applies sacrebleu's TER metric to the hypotheses and references, asserting correctness based on expected scores. There are no signs of malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be a benign, standard unit testing script for translation evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal test suite for evaluating machine translation quality metrics with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
