{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for evaluating translation quality using sacrebleu's TER metric.",
  "sources": "Imports pytest, sacrebleu, and defines constants and test cases.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "The test cases are fed into sacrebleu's TER metric for evaluation without any external data flow outside the testing framework.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The test data appears to be sample data for validation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports testing libraries and a translation evaluation library. It defines test cases with reference and hypothesis sentences, then runs a parameterized test that computes the TER score. The code is straightforward, designed for testing translation metrics. There are no signs of code injection, data leaks, or malicious activities. It does not perform network operations, system modifications, or access sensitive data. The structure and content are consistent with standard testing code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for a translation evaluation metric with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard unit testing for a Python library and contains no suspicious behavior.",
