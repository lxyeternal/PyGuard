{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest-based unit tests for the sacrebleu library, verifying the correctness of the chrF scoring functions with static, hardcoded test cases.",
  "sources": "The code reads static test data from hardcoded variables within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code does not process external inputs or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the static test cases (sources) through the sacrebleu scoring functions, with assertions verifying expected scores; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static test suite for sacrebleu's chrF metrics, with no external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It solely verifies that the library functions produce expected scores on predefined inputs. No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident. The code's purpose is benign, and the analysis confirms that it poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the detailed analysis.",
