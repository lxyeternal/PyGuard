{
  "purpose": "The code performs statistical testing on machine translation system outputs using bootstrap and randomization tests to evaluate significance of BLEU scores against reference translations.",
  "sources": "Reads pickled data from './test/wmt17_en_de_systems.pkl.bz2'; loads environment variables; uses imported modules and functions; reads input data and references for metrics.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flow leads to untrusted network, file, or environment data manipulation that would be malicious; no output sinks indicate data leaks or command execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from pickled file into memory, then through statistical tests and assertions, with p-values stored in dictionaries; no untrusted data appears to be executed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets (except a seed for reproducibility), or obfuscated code; environment variable used for seed is standard for reproducibility and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code loads translation system results and reference data, performs statistical significance tests (bootstrap and randomization) on BLEU scores, and validates the p-values against expected values. No code injection, network communication, or system manipulation is present. Usage of environment variables is for seed setting in tests, typical for reproducibility. The data reading uses standard Python libraries, and the test assertions are straightforward. No backdoors, malicious data handling, or suspicious logic are detected. Overall, the script is a structured, domain-specific testing code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, focused on statistical evaluation of translation system outputs. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor concern could be reliance on environment variables for seed setting, which is a common testing practice and not inherently malicious.",
