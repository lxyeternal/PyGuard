{
  "purpose": "The code loads a pickled dataset of translation system outputs, performs statistical significance testing (bootstrap and approximate randomization) on BLEU scores, and validates the p-values against known benchmarks.",
  "sources": "Reading data from a local bz2 compressed pickle file; environment variable SACREBLEU_SEED for reproducibility.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network transmission, file writing, or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from file -> statistical tests are performed -> p-values are compared against benchmarks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable for seed setting, which is standard but could be misused if manipulated; no obfuscation or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, loading data from a local file, performing statistical significance tests on BLEU scores, and validating results. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected. The environment variable for seed is used solely for reproducibility, which is common in testing scripts. The data flow is limited to file I/O and in-memory calculations. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate statistical evaluation script with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score is justified by the use of environment variables for reproducibility, which is standard practice. Overall, the code is safe, transparent, and appropriate for its purpose.",
