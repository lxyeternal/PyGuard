{
  "purpose": "The script performs statistical significance testing (bootstrap and randomization tests) on machine translation system outputs using BLEU scores, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads pickled data from a bz2 compressed file; sets environment variables; imports from third-party libraries for BLEU and statistical tests.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes untrusted data to sensitive locations or communicates externally; the environment variable setting is benign in this context.",
  "flows": "Loads data from file -> performs statistical tests -> stores p-values in global dictionaries -> runs assertions to verify p-value accuracy.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated functions, or hardcoded secrets; uses standard libraries and established open-source packages without suspicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads data from a pickled bz2 file, and performs bootstrap and approximate randomization tests on translation quality metrics. It sets an environment variable for reproducibility and stores p-values for later validation. The code uses well-known open-source libraries, adheres to expected data flow for statistical testing, and includes no hidden or suspicious code. The assertions verify expected p-value ranges, which are consistent with the purpose. There are no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage, and no suspicious network activity or file operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard implementation of statistical significance testing for machine translation evaluation metrics, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It strictly adheres to legitimate data processing and testing routines.",
