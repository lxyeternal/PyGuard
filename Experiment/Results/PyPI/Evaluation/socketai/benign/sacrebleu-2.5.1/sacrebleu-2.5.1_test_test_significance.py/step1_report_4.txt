{
  "purpose": "This code performs statistical evaluation of machine translation systems using bootstrap and randomization tests on BLEU scores, including reading data from a pickle file and running pytest tests for p-value validation.",
  "sources": "Reads a pickle file ('./test/wmt17_en_de_systems.pkl.bz2') for system data; imports environment variables and external libraries (sacrebleu, pytest).",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data is written or transmitted, and environment variables are only used for setting a seed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the pickle file into variables used for testing; p-values are calculated and compared against expected values in tests, but no untrusted input reaches sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets are detected; all code appears to be standard data processing and testing routines. Environment variable 'SACREBLEU_SEED' is set but used only for reproducibility.",
  "analysis": "The script loads data from a local compressed pickle file, calculates p-values for system comparisons using bootstrap and randomization tests, and validates these against expected values via pytest. There are no signs of malicious payloads, network activity, or secret exfiltration. The code uses standard libraries and practices for statistical testing. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for statistical evaluation of translation systems. It reads local data, performs statistical analysis, and verifies results without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The environment variable setting is benign and only used for reproducibility. Overall security risk is minimal.",
