{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform statistical significance testing (bootstrap and approximate randomization tests) on machine translation system outputs using BLEU scores, loading data from pickled files, and validating p-values against known benchmarks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a pickle file './test/wmt17_en_de_systems.pkl.bz2' via bz2 and pickle modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations. No external data is written or transmitted. No user inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the pickle file into in-memory variables, then through statistical test functions, with results stored in dictionaries for validation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. Use of environment variables is limited to setting a seed for reproducibility.",
  "analysis": "The code loads data from a compressed pickle file, uses established statistical libraries to compute significance tests on translation outputs, and validates results against known benchmark p-values. It only performs statistical analysis and file I/O, with no network activity, code injection, or malicious operations observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard statistical evaluation tool for translation system outputs, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs data loading, statistical calculations, and validation without suspicious or harmful actions.",
