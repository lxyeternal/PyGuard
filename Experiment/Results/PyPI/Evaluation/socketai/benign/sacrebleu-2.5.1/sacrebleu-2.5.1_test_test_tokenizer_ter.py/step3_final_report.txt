{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the 'TercomTokenizer' class, verifying its behavior with various input configurations.",
  "sources": "Static test data defined within the test cases; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code performs assertions on tokenizer outputs without external data handling.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed directly to the tokenizer; outputs are compared to expected results within the test framework.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; the code is straightforward testing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of parameterized unit tests using pytest, with predefined input-output pairs. There are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code structure is standard for testing a tokenizer class, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The test cases cover various configurations and language inputs, but all are static and benign. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of unit tests for the 'TercomTokenizer' class, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
