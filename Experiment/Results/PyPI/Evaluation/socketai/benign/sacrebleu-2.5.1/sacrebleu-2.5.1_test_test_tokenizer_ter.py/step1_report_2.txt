{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test cases for the TercomTokenizer class from the sacrebleu library, verifying its behavior under different configurations.",
  "sources": "Code reads static test input strings defined in the test cases.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks are present; the code primarily performs assertions.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed directly to the tokenizer instances; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks outside the test assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious payloads, or obfuscated code are detected. The code uses standard testing patterns with no suspicious patterns or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pytest framework and a tokenizer class, then defines several test cases with static input strings. Each test function initializes the tokenizer with specific configurations and asserts expected output. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or system modifications. The code appears to be standard test code for a library component. No suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe set of unit tests for a tokenizer class. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The overall security risk score is negligible.",
