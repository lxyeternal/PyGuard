{
  "purpose": "This code is a test suite for the sacrebleu Python package, which calculates BLEU scores for machine translation evaluation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static test data from predefined lists and imports modules such as collections, pytest, and sacrebleu.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that handle untrusted input or data; all data used are hardcoded or controlled within the test environment.",
  "flows": "The test functions process static input data to produce BLEU scores; there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code primarily consists of test cases and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite using pytest for the sacrebleu package, containing predefined test cases and no dynamic input handling or network interactions. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic detected. The package's purpose appears solely to evaluate BLEU scores, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for BLEU score evaluation with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It uses controlled, static test data and standard testing libraries, indicating no supply chain security risks.",
