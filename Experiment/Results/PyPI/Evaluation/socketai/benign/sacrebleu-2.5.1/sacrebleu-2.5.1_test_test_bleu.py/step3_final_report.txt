  "purpose": "A static test suite for sacrebleu library, verifying BLEU score calculations with predefined, controlled data.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded test data within the code, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "In-memory computations, no external data sinks or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static test inputs through BLEU calculation functions to output scores; no untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests using fixed datasets and standard library functions. There are no external data inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The scores and assertions are based on controlled, static data, indicating a benign and safe testing environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign test suite with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score can be confidently set to 0 for consistency.",
  "confidence": 1,
