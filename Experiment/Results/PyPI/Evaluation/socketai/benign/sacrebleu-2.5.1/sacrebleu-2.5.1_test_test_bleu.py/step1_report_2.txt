{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a set of unit tests for the 'sacrebleu' Python library, which is used for evaluating BLEU scores in machine translation tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from predefined test cases within the script, including hypothesis and reference texts, and imports from external modules such as 'sacrebleu' and 'pytest'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted or external data that could lead to security issues. The code primarily performs in-memory computations and assertions.",
  "flows": "The code processes test inputs through the sacrebleu library functions, computes BLEU scores, and asserts correctness. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; it only tests known inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. The code does not include any network operations, file I/O, or environment variable usage. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the sacrebleu library, validating BLEU score calculations across various scenarios, including edge cases. It uses standard testing frameworks and external libraries without any suspicious patterns or malicious logic. The code is static, self-contained, and focused solely on computational verification. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious activity is detectable.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, standard testing script for the sacrebleu library. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and performs in-memory computations exclusively. The likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.",
