{
  "purpose": "The code implements a set of tests for the sacrebleu Python library, specifically for BLEU score calculations used in machine translation evaluation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from test case variables, such as hypotheses and references, and from the sacrebleu library functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted or external data; the code primarily performs calculations and assertions within a testing framework.",
  "flows": "Input hypotheses and references flow into sacrebleu's BLEU score functions for evaluation; the code then asserts expected results. No data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code consists of standard testing procedures with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of pytest-based unit tests for the sacrebleu library, testing BLEU score computations under various conditions. It imports standard libraries, defines test cases with expected results, and uses parameterized tests for coverage. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. There are no inputs from external sources other than test data, and no outputs or network communications are observed. The code appears purely to validate the correctness of BLEU scoring functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for the sacrebleu library, with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security risks. It performs internal calculations and assertions only, with no suspicious activities detected.",
