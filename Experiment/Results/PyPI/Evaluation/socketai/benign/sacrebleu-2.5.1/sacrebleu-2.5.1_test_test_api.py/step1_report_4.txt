  "purpose": "Unit testing functions related to dataset handling and file I/O for the sacrebleu translation evaluation library.",
  "sources": "File reads from get_source_file and get_reference_files, dataset keys from DATASETS.",
  "sinks": "File read operations and dataset key access, which are standard I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Test functions call dataset-related functions, read files, and compare content.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs unit tests using pytest to verify dataset retrieval and file content correctness. It reads files to verify source and reference sentences, checks available datasets, language pairs, and test sets against expected values. There are no dynamic code executions, external network calls, or sensitive data handling. The functions tested appear to interact with dataset files and in-memory dataset structures, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for dataset access functions, with no indications of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to serve its purpose in verifying dataset retrieval functionalities.",
