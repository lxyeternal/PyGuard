{
  "purpose": "This code implements statistical significance testing (approximate randomization and bootstrap) for evaluating system outputs against baselines in machine translation tasks, using various metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables for seed values, accesses system hypotheses, reference data, and metric computations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that would lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code; no network, file, or system command executions are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable for seed -> RNG for bootstrap and AR tests -> Metric computations -> Result objects containing scores and p-values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments detected. Use of environment variables for seed could be exploited to influence randomness but is standard practice. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical significance testing by precomputing baseline metrics, performing bootstrap and approximate randomization tests, and optionally estimating confidence intervals. It uses numpy RNG with seed control, manages multiprocessing on non-Windows systems, and logs information. No external network calls, system modifications, or malicious logic are present. The code's logic aligns with standard statistical testing methods and does not contain suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured implementation of statistical significance tests for MT evaluation, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It uses environment variables and multiprocessing responsibly. No malware indicators or malicious code anomalies are found.",
