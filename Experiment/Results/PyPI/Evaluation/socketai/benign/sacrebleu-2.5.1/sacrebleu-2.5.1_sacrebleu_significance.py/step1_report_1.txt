{
  "purpose": "The code implements statistical significance testing for machine translation evaluation metrics, supporting paired bootstrap and approximate randomization tests, including parallel execution.",
  "sources": "Environment variables ('SACREBLEU_SEED') for seeding RNG, data input through function parameters (hypotheses, references, metrics), and internal method calls for data extraction and score computation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output channels (e.g., network, file writes, external command execution) identified; results are stored in memory and returned.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input hypotheses and references to metric computations, which generate statistics and scores; these are used in bootstrap and randomization procedures to compute p-values and confidence intervals.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution found. The code uses environment variables for RNG seed but does not rely on external or suspicious inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on statistical evaluation of translation metrics, using numpy for data manipulation and multiprocessing for parallel processing. Environment variables influence RNG seed, which is standard for reproducibility. The functions perform bootstrap and randomization tests, with no evidence of malicious behavior such as network access, system manipulation, or data exfiltration. No suspicious or malicious code segments, backdoors, or hidden functionalities are detected. The code structure adheres to typical evaluation workflows, with appropriate use of safe library functions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a secure implementation of statistical significance testing for MT metrics. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The use of environment variables for RNG seeding is standard practice for reproducibility and poses no security risk. Overall, the code is safe and aligns with common evaluation routines.",
