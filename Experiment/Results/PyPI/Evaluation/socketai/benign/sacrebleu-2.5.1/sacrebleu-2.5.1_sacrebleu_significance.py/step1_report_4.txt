{
  "purpose": "This code implements statistical significance testing methods (approximate randomization and paired bootstrap) for machine translation evaluation metrics. It manages multiple systems, computes metrics, and performs parallelized hypothesis testing.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SACREBLEU_SEED', input hypotheses, reference sequences, and metric data structures.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage via logging (sacrelogger), but no untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or external system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input hypotheses and reference data flow into metric computations, which are then used in statistical tests (AR and bootstrap). The seed environment variable influences random number generators for reproducibility, and results are stored in Result objects. There are no suspicious or external data flows outside expected statistical testing procedures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior detected. The code uses standard libraries, logging, numpy, multiprocessing, and custom metric classes. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The seed is obtained from environment variables but used solely for RNG seeding, which is normal for statistical reproducibility.",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical significance testing using bootstrap and approximate randomization methods, leveraging numpy for randomization and calculations. It includes precomputing baseline statistics, parallel execution with multiprocessing (with OS compatibility considerations), and logging for progress tracking. No external network or file access beyond logging is detected. The environment variable influences RNG seed, ensuring reproducibility. All functions and classes serve legitimate statistical testing purposes. The code appears to be a standard implementation of significance testing for machine translation metrics with no signs of malicious or sabotage intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate statistical testing module for MT evaluation metrics, with no malicious behavior or security risks observed. It manages data securely within the scope of statistical analysis and parallel execution, and there are no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
