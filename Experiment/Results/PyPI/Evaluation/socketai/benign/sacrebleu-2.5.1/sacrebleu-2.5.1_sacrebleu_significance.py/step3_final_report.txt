  "purpose": "The code implements statistical significance testing (bootstrap and approximate randomization) for machine translation metrics, supporting parallel execution and reproducibility via environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SACREBLEU_SEED' for RNG seed, hypotheses, references, and metric computations.",
  "sinks": "Results stored in memory; no external network, file, or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "Input hypotheses/references -> metric computations -> bootstrap/randomization procedures -> results in memory.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or external dependencies; uses standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate statistical tests with standard libraries, manages RNG seed via environment variables, and supports multiprocessing with OS considerations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The environment variable for seed control is common for reproducibility, and parallel processing is responsibly implemented. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of statistical significance testing for MT evaluation metrics. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage mechanisms. Its use of environment variables for seeding is standard practice and does not pose security risks.",
