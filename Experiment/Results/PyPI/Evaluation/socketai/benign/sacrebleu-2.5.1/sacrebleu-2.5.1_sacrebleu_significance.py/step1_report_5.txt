{
  "purpose": "The code implements statistical significance testing methods (approximate randomization and bootstrap) for evaluating machine translation systems, including parallel processing support.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (SACREBLEU_SEED) for seed values, input hypotheses, reference data, and system metrics.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network, file writing, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Seed from environment variables -> RNG for bootstrap and permutation tests -> computation of scores and p-values -> results stored in Result objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code relies on standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs statistical evaluation of system outputs using bootstrap and approximate randomization tests. It utilizes environment variables for seed control, which could influence reproducibility but does not imply malicious intent. The multiprocessing implementation is standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution. The functions focus solely on statistical testing, and there are no network, file, or privacy-violating operations. The structure and content appear typical for a scientific evaluation tool, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a statistical evaluation framework for MT systems, implementing standard techniques without any malicious or suspicious features. There are no indications of malware, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage.",
