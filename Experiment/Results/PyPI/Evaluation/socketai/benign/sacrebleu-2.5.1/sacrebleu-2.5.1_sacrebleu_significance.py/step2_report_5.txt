  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described functionality with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code implements statistical significance testing (bootstrap and approximate randomization) for MT evaluation metrics.\n- It uses environment variables ('SACREBLEU_SEED') for RNG seed control, which is standard for reproducibility.\n- No external network, file, or system commands are executed.\n- Parallel processing is handled via multiprocessing, with OS-specific fallbacks.\n- No obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- Results are stored in memory and returned; no data exfiltration or external communication occurs.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose & Data flow:** Correctly describes the purpose—statistical significance testing for MT metrics, with data flowing from hypotheses/references into metric computations, then into bootstrap/randomization procedures.\n\n**Anomalies & Security:** No suspicious code or external dependencies. Environment variable for seed is standard.\n\n**Conclusion & Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious behavior) — justified.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — very low, as no real security concern.  \n- Confidence: 0.9 — appropriate given the thorough analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose & Data flow:** Correctly describes the implementation of significance testing, seed control, and data flow.\n\n**Anomalies & Security:** No suspicious code. Use of environment variable for seed is standard.\n\n**Conclusion & Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — low, standard statistical code.  \n- Confidence: 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, well-justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose & Data flow:** Correctly states the purpose and data flow. The code reads environment variables, uses numpy RNG, and performs statistical tests.\n\n**Anomalies & Security:** No suspicious behavior. The use of environment variables for seed is normal.\n\n**Conclusion & Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — minimal security risk, mostly standard practice.  \n- Confidence: 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose & Data flow:** Correctly describes the statistical testing functions, data flow, and use of environment variables.\n\n**Anomalies & Security:** No malicious behavior detected. The code uses standard libraries, and the seed is used solely for RNG.\n\n**Conclusion & Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malware.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — low, typical for such code.  \n- Confidence: 0.9 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose & Data flow:** Correctly summarizes the purpose, seed control, and data flow.\n\n**Anomalies & Security:** No suspicious code, no external network or file operations.\n\n**Conclusion & Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — low, standard practice.  \n- Confidence: 0.95 — very high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0; no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk score:** The code involves RNG seeding and multiprocessing, but these are standard practices in statistical evaluation code. The reports assign 0.1, which seems reasonable given the context. A slightly higher score (e.g., 0.2) could be argued if considering potential seed manipulation, but given the code, 0.1 is justified.  \n- **Confidence scores:** Appropriately high, reflecting thorough analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — standard statistical code, minimal security concern.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — consistent with detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. No security risks or malicious behaviors are evident in the code.",
