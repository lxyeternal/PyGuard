  "purpose": "Store and validate SAR application metadata properties.",
  "sources": "Input dictionary 'app_metadata' during object initialization.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data leading to vulnerabilities; data is stored and validated locally.",
  "flows": "Input dictionary -> object properties -> validation checks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to manage SAR metadata, with straightforward attribute assignment from a dictionary and validation logic to ensure required properties are present and mutually exclusive fields are not both set. There are no external data sources, network calls, or file operations. The validation logic is standard and does not include unsafe practices. No indications of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data container with validation logic for application metadata. No malicious intent or security risks identified.",
