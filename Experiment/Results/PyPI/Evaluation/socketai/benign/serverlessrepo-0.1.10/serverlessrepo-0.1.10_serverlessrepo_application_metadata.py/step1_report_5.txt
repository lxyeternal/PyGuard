  "purpose": "Store and validate SAR application metadata properties in a structured manner.",
  "sources": "Input dictionary 'app_metadata' provided during initialization.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code performs data validation and storage in object attributes.",
  "flows": "Input 'app_metadata' -> object attributes; validation checks properties for missing or conflicting data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed. The code performs straightforward data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for storing application metadata with clearly defined properties. It reads data from a provided dictionary during instantiation and offers a validation method to ensure required properties are set and mutually exclusive fields are handled correctly. The validation raises errors for missing required fields and conflicting license/readme information. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external data leaks, or suspicious code patterns. It appears to be a standard data container and validator, with no indicators of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign metadata storage class with validation, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for its purpose without any suspicious or malicious code components.",
