{
  "purpose": "To store and validate SAR application metadata properties.",
  "sources": "Input data from the 'app_metadata' dictionary provided during object initialization.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is transmitted externally or used in insecure operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'app_metadata' dictionary into class attributes; validation checks for missing or conflicting properties.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for storing SAR metadata, with straightforward initialization from a dictionary and validation logic for required properties. It imports an exception class for validation errors but does not perform any network, file, or system operations. No suspicious code paths, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The validation method only checks for missing properties and mutually exclusive license/readme fields, which are legitimate validation steps.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data container with validation logic, without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform external data transmission, system modifications, or other potentially malicious actions.",
