  "purpose": "Store and validate SAR application metadata properties.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via the constructor as a dictionary 'app_metadata'. No other input sources are present.",
  "targets": "No sinks or untrusted data destinations are present. The code mainly processes data in memory.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'app_metadata' into object attributes. Validation checks are performed on these attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The class stores metadata properties with straightforward getter assignments. Validation enforces required properties and mutually exclusive fields. No code injection, external data transmission, or malicious behavior is observed. The class functions solely as a data container with validation logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data container and validator for application metadata, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
