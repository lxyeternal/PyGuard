{
  "purpose": "Helper functions for parsing, handling, and manipulating AWS SAM templates in YAML or JSON format.",
  "sources": "Reading input template string in parse_template; accessing template_dict in get_app_metadata and strip_app_metadata.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; functions primarily parse and modify data structures without writing untrusted data to external systems.",
  "flows": "parse_template reads input string -> attempts JSON or YAML parsing -> returns dictionary; get_app_metadata accesses nested dict values; strip_app_metadata modifies dict in-memory.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deep copy to modify template; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no code injection points or suspicious network activity; intrinsic function parsing is standard; no obfuscated code or obfuscation patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for parsing and modifying AWS SAM templates, supporting both JSON and YAML formats. It includes mechanisms for handling CloudFormation intrinsic functions and structured YAML dumping. The functions operate on data structures in-memory, with no external calls or side effects. The regex pattern for application ID extraction appears standard and safe. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code does not perform any network communication, file system modifications, or privilege escalation. The use of deep copies indicates safe manipulation of templates without affecting original data. Overall, the code appears well-structured, legitimate, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of safe utility functions for parsing and handling AWS SAM templates. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It operates solely on data parsing and manipulation without external or suspicious activities.",
