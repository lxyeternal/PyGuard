  "purpose": "Helper functions for parsing, handling, and extracting data from CloudFormation/SAM templates in YAML or JSON format.",
  "sources": "Input: template_str parameter in parse_template; template_dict parameter in get_app_metadata and strip_app_metadata; text parameter in parse_application_id.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code primarily handles data parsing and extraction without performing any destructive or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into dictionaries, application metadata is retrieved from specific sections, and application IDs are extracted via regex. No data flows to untrusted external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with standard parsing routines. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident. Intrinsics handling is typical for YAML parsing, with no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for parsing YAML/JSON templates, extracting application metadata, and stripping specific sections. It uses standard libraries and safe parsing methods. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data flows are present. The regex pattern for application IDs appears standard, and there is no evidence of malicious data exfiltration, code injection, or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module designed for safe parsing and handling of CloudFormation/SAM templates. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
