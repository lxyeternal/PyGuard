  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The functions handle parsing YAML/JSON, extracting metadata, and application IDs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data is transmitted externally; parsing is in-memory.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; regex is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code performs safe parsing, with no malicious behavior or backdoors. Use of safe libraries and no external effects suggest minimal security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2 (slightly above zero, but justified given the parsing context).\n\n**Assessment:** Sound, no issues. The slight security risk score accounts for potential parsing errors or misuse, but overall minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions for parsing templates.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication; in-memory operations.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of deep copy is safe; no secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard code for template handling. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Assessment:** Well justified, no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with standard parsing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external effects.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate utility code, safe, no malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct, minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions, with potential concern over regex and YAML constructor.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external side effects.\n- **Anomalies:** No secrets or obfuscation; YAML intrinsics handled safely.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Functions are safe; no malicious behavior or malicious data flow.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar utility functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transmission.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; regex and parsing are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct, no concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** No. All reports agree that the code is standard, safe, and free of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports are zero, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports, correct given the straightforward nature.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2) in some reports, justified by the potential for parsing errors or misuse, but not indicative of actual security threats.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0.0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** — minimal, justified by the use of parsing libraries and regex, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a safe, standard utility module for parsing and manipulating AWS SAM templates. No signs of supply chain compromise, malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The scores across reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.",
