  "purpose": "Helper functions for parsing and dumping SAM templates, extracting application metadata, and application IDs.",
  "sources": "Input parameter in parse_template (template_str), template_dict in get_app_metadata and strip_app_metadata, text in parse_application_id.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no sinks for untrusted data leading to effects or leaks are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from parse_template, get_app_metadata, or parse_application_id through processing functions, but no untrusted data is directed to dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious control flows. Functions for parsing and processing templates appear standard. Use of regex is benign and intended for pattern matching.",
  "analysis": "The code implements YAML and JSON parsing with safe handling, custom constructors for CloudFormation intrinsics, and functions to manipulate template metadata. No code injection, unsafe eval, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The pattern matching for application IDs is straightforward and only used for extraction. The functions perform expected operations: parsing templates, retrieving metadata, stripping metadata sections, and extracting application IDs. No backdoors, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code seems consistent with a utility module for template handling without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility for parsing and handling CloudFormation/SAM templates with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It contains standard pattern matching, safe parsing routines, and straightforward data processing. No security risks or malware are evident.",
