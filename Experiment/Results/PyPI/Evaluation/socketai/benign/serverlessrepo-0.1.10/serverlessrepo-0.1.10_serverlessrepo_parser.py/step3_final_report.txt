  "purpose": "Helper functions for parsing AWS SAM templates in YAML or JSON formats, extracting metadata, application IDs, and manipulating template sections.",
  "sources": "Reading input template string, YAML/JSON parsing, regex matching for application IDs.",
  "sinks": "In-memory data structures; no external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input string -> parse_template -> internal data structures -> get_app_metadata / parse_application_id / strip_app_metadata",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs safe parsing libraries (json, yaml.safe_load), custom constructors for intrinsic functions, and regex for extracting application IDs. No network calls, external data handling, or code injection present. Deep copies are used for data safety. The regex pattern is straightforward. No obfuscation techniques are used. The functions serve as utility parsers and manipulators, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for parsing and manipulating AWS SAM templates. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain risks are evident. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and integrity.",
