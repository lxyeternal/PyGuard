  "purpose": "Helper functions for parsing and handling AWS SAM templates, including YAML/JSON parsing, intrinsics processing, and metadata extraction.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'template_str' in parse_template; template_dict in get_app_metadata and strip_app_metadata; 'text' in parse_application_id",
  "sinks": "None observed; code does not write or transmit data untrusted sources, nor does it execute commands based on untrusted data",
  "flows": "parse_template reads input string and parses it into dict; get_app_metadata accesses specific metadata fields; parse_application_id searches for application ID patterns in input text",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Use of regex for application ID pattern is standard and not suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard parsing and manipulation of CloudFormation/SAM templates, handling both JSON and YAML formats. It uses safe parsing methods, avoids executing code from untrusted sources, and carefully manipulates template data structures. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration are present. All functions operate on input data, with no network communication, system modifications, or suspicious code logic. The use of deep copy to manipulate template data is safe and standard. The regex pattern is for pattern matching, not obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for processing AWS SAM templates, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected operations with safe methods and contains no suspicious or malicious code. Overall security risk is minimal.",
