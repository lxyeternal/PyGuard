  "purpose": "Functions to publish or update serverless applications in AWS SAR, managing application metadata, versions, and handling API interactions.",
  "sources": "User input: 'template' parameter, read via parse_template or passed as dict; Application metadata extraction from 'template'; AWS SDK responses and exceptions.",
  "sinks": "AWS SDK boto3 client calls (create_application, update_application, create_application_version); Exception handling functions that generate custom error objects.",
  "flows": "Input 'template' -> parsed or copied into 'template_dict' -> metadata extracted -> request objects created -> AWS API calls (create/update/app version) -> responses processed; Errors caught and wrapped into custom exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code or misleading variable names; no untrusted data flow to dangerous sinks like network calls outside AWS SDK; exception handling appears standard. Usage of regex in error parsing is safe, assuming error message formats are consistent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles application metadata and AWS SDK interactions with proper validation and error handling. No evidence of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network tunneling, or backdoors. Functions use SDK calls for resource creation and updates, and handle specific errors, wrapping them into custom exceptions. No suspicious dynamic execution, obfuscated patterns, or hardcoded secrets are present. The regex usage for error parsing is safe given context. Overall, the code performs legitimate tasks related to application publishing with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for managing AWS Serverless Application Repository resources, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles inputs, interacts with AWS SDK, and manages errors responsibly. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
