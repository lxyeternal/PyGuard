  "purpose": "Functions to publish or update AWS Serverless Application Repository applications, managing templates, metadata, and AWS API interactions.",
  "sources": "Template input (string or dict), AWS API responses, error messages from boto3 client.",
  "sinks": "AWS API calls (create/update application and version), error handling logic.",
  "flows": "Input templates parsed -> request objects constructed -> AWS API invoked -> responses or exceptions processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AWS SDK operations for application publishing, with validation, request construction, and error handling. Regex parsing of error messages is safe in context. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The logic aligns with typical application deployment workflows. Error handling wraps AWS errors into custom exceptions, which is standard practice. No obfuscation or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-specific implementation for managing AWS SAR applications. It exhibits no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and risk score (0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
