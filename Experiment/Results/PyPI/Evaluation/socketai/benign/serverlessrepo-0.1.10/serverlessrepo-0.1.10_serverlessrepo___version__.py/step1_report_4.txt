  "purpose": "Defines metadata for the 'serverlessrepo' Python package, including version, license, description, and author information.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reads present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external calls, or outputs to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this is static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns detected; code is straightforward attribute assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of string attribute assignments that define package metadata. There are no functions, external calls, or data handling operations. No hardcoded credentials, network activities, or obfuscated code are present. The purpose is purely descriptive, serving as package metadata. This is standard practice in Python packages and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign metadata declaration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It provides package information without performing any operations or data handling that could be malicious.",
