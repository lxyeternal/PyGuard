  "purpose": "Package metadata declaration for the 'serverlessrepo' Python library.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments defining package info (__title__, __version__, __license__, __description__, __url__, __author__, __author_email__).",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assigned to variables without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and human-readable.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments containing package metadata. There are no functions, external calls, dynamic behaviors, or data flows. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0, reflecting its harmless nature. The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package metadata file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
