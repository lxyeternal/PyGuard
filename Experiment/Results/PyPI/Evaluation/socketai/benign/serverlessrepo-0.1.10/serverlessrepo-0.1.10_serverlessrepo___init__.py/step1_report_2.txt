{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define and import functions related to managing AWS Serverless Application Repository applications, including publishing, updating metadata, and permission management.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions from local modules (.publish and .permission_helper). No external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or system calls observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports functions and does not execute any logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward module import statements with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements for specific functions from local modules. There is no input handling, no data processing, and no system commands. It serves as a library for other code to call these imported functions. No signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks are present within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, non-malicious module definition and import setup for an AWS-related library. There are no indicators of malware, security issues, or suspicious behavior.",
