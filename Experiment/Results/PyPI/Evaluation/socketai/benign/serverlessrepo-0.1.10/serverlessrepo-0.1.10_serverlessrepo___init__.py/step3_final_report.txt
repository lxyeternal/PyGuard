  "purpose": "Library setup for AWS Serverless Application Repository functions, importing relevant modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.publish and .permission_helper).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static imports without execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for functions related to AWS application publishing and permission management. It does not execute logic, handle data, or perform network operations. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code acts as a benign interface or library setup. The imported functions' behavior cannot be inferred from this snippet, but the code itself is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, straightforward module import setup with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and securityRisk: 0 are justified and appropriate given the simplicity and nature of the code.",
