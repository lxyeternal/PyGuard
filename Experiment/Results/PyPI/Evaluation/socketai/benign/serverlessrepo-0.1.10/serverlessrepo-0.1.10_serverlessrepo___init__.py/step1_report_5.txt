  "purpose": "Library providing functions to publish, update, and manage permissions for AWS Serverless Applications.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from local modules 'publish' and 'permission_helper'. No external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data leakage points present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified; code primarily imports functions and does not execute logic.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. Code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions related to AWS application publishing and permission management from local modules. There are no user inputs, external data sources, or sinks. The structure is clean and typical for a library module. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code does not perform any operations upon import other than bringing in functions, indicating it is a standard library setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard library module for AWS Serverless Application management. No malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and no security risks are detected within this snippet.",
