  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the code to assess the security implications, scoring, and any potential issues.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, each with message templates and an __init__ method that formats these messages.\n   - There are no data processing, external inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The MESSAGE templates are static strings with placeholders, used for error reporting.\n   - No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities is present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward class definitions for exceptions.\n   - They note that the message formatting could involve external input, but clarify that no such input handling occurs within this code snippet.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis, with no logical flaws or misinterpretations.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest score assigned is 0, indicating no risk.\n   - Since the code is purely for exception handling with static message templates, there's no basis for higher risk scores.\n   - No evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities justifies raising the risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing external code, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n   - The message templates are static and do not contain executable code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the potential for message formatting to include untrusted input but clarify that this code does not process such input.\n   - No false positives or speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's content.\n   - The overall assessment is that this code is safe, with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes used for structured error handling. It does not include any dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious behavior. The message templates are static and only formatted with provided keyword arguments during exception instantiation, which is safe. There are no indications of supply chain vulnerabilities or malware.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and security risk.",
