  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in the serverlessrepo library.",
  "sources": "Exception class initializations and message formatting in __init__ methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects with formatted messages, which are static strings or contain error messages.",
  "anomalies": "Use of message templates that could be formatted with external input; however, no direct untrusted input handling or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. Each class has a MESSAGE template used for error descriptions, some of which include placeholders for dynamic data. The __init__ method calls the parent constructor with formatted message strings. There is no evidence of data being read from untrusted sources, nor any code executing external commands or network activity. The messages include URLs for documentation, but these are static links, not code injections or data exfiltration points. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception classes with templated error messages. There is no malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks present. The code does not process external inputs beyond message formatting, which is safe in this context.",
