  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to the serverlessrepo library, mainly for error reporting and debugging.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; the code defines exception classes and their messages, which are used during error handling.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or outputs; exception messages are used for error reporting but do not involve untrusted data processing within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs within this code; it only defines error classes and messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior present. The message templates are standard string format templates for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions, each with a predefined message template. These classes inherit from the base Exception class and are used to handle specific error conditions related to the serverless application repository. There is no dynamic code execution, data handling, or external data sources involved. The MESSAGE attributes are static templates, and the __init__ method formats these templates with provided kwargs during exception instantiation. Overall, the code appears to serve as a structured error handling mechanism without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for defining custom exceptions with formatted messages. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It is a standard implementation for error handling in a Python library, with no indication of supply chain attack vectors or malware.",
