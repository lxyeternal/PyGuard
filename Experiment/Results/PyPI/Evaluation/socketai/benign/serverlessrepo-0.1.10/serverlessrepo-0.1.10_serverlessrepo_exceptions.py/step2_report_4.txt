  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, considering the code and the provided assessments.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with message templates. There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, or external interactions. The code is straightforward and static, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports uniformly conclude that the code is safe, with no anomalies or security risks. They note that the MESSAGE templates include placeholders for error messages but do not process untrusted input directly within this code. This is accurate.  \nNo logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning. The analysis is consistent with the code provided.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.  \n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty about the safety of the code.  \n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the straightforward class definitions.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports correctly identify no malicious behavior, the risk scores should remain at 0. The code is purely for exception handling, with no external data handling or dynamic execution.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They acknowledge that message templates could be formatted with external input but clarify that no such input handling occurs here, and the code itself is safe.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious code present)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is straightforward)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (appropriate, no security risks identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes used for error handling within a Python library. It contains no dynamic code execution, no external data processing, and no signs of malware or obfuscation. The detailed reviews support this conclusion.\n\n**In conclusion, I agree with the assessments provided.** The code is safe, well-structured, and free of security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the code's nature and the analysis provided.",
