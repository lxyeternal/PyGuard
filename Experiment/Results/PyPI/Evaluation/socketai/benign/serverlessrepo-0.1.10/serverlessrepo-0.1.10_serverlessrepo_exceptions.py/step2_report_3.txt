  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and whether any scores need adjustment.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n\n- The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception.\n- Each class contains a MESSAGE attribute, which is a string template.\n- The __init__ method formats the MESSAGE with provided keyword arguments.\n- There are no data inputs, external interactions, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code is purely structural for error handling, with no malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Findings:** The code is straightforward class definitions with string templates; no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully accurate. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no external data or dynamic code execution; just exception classes.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Findings:** Exception classes with message templates; no data processing or external interactions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Findings:** Same as above; purely class definitions for error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Findings:** Consistent with previous; no malicious activity or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **No.** All reports correctly identify that the code is just exception class definitions with no malicious or security-risk behavior.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  **No.** The reports are consistent, accurate, and comprehensive.\n\n- **Scores (malware, obfuscated, risk):**  \n  All are set to 0, which aligns with the code's nature. No changes needed.\n\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  **None.** All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as safe.\n\n- **Malware justification:**  \n  Since no malicious activity is detected, malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations**\n\n- The code is standard for defining custom exceptions, with no external data handling, code execution, or suspicious patterns.\n- The scores are appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.\n- The confidence levels are high, given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Estimated Scores (My Conclusion):**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0** |\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is purely structural, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The exception classes are standard practice in Python libraries.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways consider the context in which such code is used. In this case, the code is safe, and the reports are accurate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
