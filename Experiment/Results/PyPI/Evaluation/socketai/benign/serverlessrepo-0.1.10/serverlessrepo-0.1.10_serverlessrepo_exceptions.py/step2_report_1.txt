  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base class.\n- Each class contains a MESSAGE template string with placeholders.\n- The __init__ method formats the MESSAGE with provided keyword arguments.\n- There are no data processing, external input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and used for structured error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. All reports agree that this is standard exception class definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical errors:** None observed.\n- **Security flaws:** None observed.\n- **Code quality:** The use of `self.MESSAGE.format(**kwargs)` in `Exception.__init__` is acceptable, but it assumes that all necessary placeholders are provided during instantiation. If not, it could raise a `KeyError`, but this is a minor concern and not indicative of malicious intent.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5. Given the code's nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate. It’s purely for error handling, with no external data processing or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential Issues with the Reports:\n- **Assumption-based claims:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static exception class definitions with no malicious behavior. No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the safe use of string formatting.\n- **Formatting placeholders:** While the MESSAGE templates contain placeholders, their use is standard for error messages and does not introduce security risks unless external untrusted input is directly injected without validation. The code itself does not process such input; it merely formats messages during exception instantiation.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for a Python library. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The detailed reports correctly reflect this.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No supply chain attack vectors or malware are evident in this code. It is purely structural error handling code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep the scores as they are—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.",
