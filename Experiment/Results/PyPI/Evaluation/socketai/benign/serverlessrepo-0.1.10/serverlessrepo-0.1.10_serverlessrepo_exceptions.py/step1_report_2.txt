  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the serverlessrepo library, mainly for error handling and messaging.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static class definitions and string templates.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; just exception message formatting.",
  "flows": "Exception initialization with message formatting, which is static and safe.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class definitions with string templates.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with message templates for various error scenarios. There are no data inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling. The MESSAGE templates include placeholders for error messages but do not include dynamic or external data sources that could lead to injection or leakage. No code execution, data processing, or external system interaction is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely defining exception classes with static message templates. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The code appears to be safe and intended solely for structured error handling within a larger application.",
