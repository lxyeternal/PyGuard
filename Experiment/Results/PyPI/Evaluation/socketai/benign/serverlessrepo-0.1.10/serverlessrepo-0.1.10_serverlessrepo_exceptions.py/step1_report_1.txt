  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the serverlessrepo library with formatted error messages.",
  "sources": "None (these are class definitions and string templates).",
  "sinks": "None (no data processing or external input/output actions present).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from source to sink within the code).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward class definitions for exceptions with message templates.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. Each class contains a MESSAGE attribute used for formatted error messages. The __init__ method in the base class formats the message with provided keyword arguments. There are no dynamic code execution, external inputs, or data manipulation beyond string formatting. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be standard for defining custom exceptions in a Python library.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions with message templates; it contains no malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It is a standard pattern for custom exception handling.",
