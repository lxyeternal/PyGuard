  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the serverlessrepo library with message templates.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with MESSAGE string templates, used during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input processing occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exceptions with keyword arguments formatting MESSAGE templates; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static class definitions with straightforward message formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with message templates. The __init__ method formats these messages with provided kwargs, which is standard practice. There is no data processing, external input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The MESSAGE templates include placeholders but are not used in a way that introduces security risks within this code snippet. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exception classes for structured error handling. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The provided reports and scores accurately reflect this assessment.",
