  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of Python exception classes with string message templates.\n- The __init__ method in the base class formats the message with kwargs.\n- No external data, network activity, or code execution is present.\n- The MESSAGE templates are static strings with placeholders, used for error reporting.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- The code is standard for defining custom exceptions in a Python library.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes with message templates.\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct, and the logic of message formatting is straightforward.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None observed.\n- **Data leaks or security risks:** None observed.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only point to consider is that message templates include placeholders for dynamic data, which could, in theory, be exploited if untrusted input is passed during exception instantiation. However, this is standard practice, and the risk is minimal if input is sanitized elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report's reasoning and scores:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Straightforward class definitions, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with static message templates, no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Exception classes with message templates, no external data or code execution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Exception classes, message formatting, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Are any scores unreasonable?\n\n- All reports assign malware=0, which is correct.\n- Security risk=0 is appropriate.\n- Confidence=1 is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be 0, as code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, since no security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\nBased on the analysis, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a standard pattern for exception handling, with no malicious or security concerns.\n\n**Final scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and free of vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. No changes needed.",
