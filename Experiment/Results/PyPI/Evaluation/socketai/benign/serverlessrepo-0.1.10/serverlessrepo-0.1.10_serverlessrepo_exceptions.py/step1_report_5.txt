  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in a serverless application repository library.",
  "sources": "Exception classes and their MESSAGE attributes, __init__ methods, and error message templates.",
  "sinks": "Exception instantiation, formatting of error messages with provided kwargs.",
  "flows": "Error occurs during exception creation; error messages are formatted with input data, then thrown.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no external data handling, no suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exceptions for a serverless application repository library. Each class extends Exception and sets a MESSAGE template. The __init__ method formats this MESSAGE with keyword arguments. There is no dynamic code execution, external input handling, or other suspicious activity. The MESSAGE templates and class structures are straightforward and intended for error handling. No evidence of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leaks is present. The use of formatted strings could theoretically be exploited if user-controlled input is passed into error messages, but this is standard practice and not inherently malicious. Overall, the code serves as a structured exception framework without suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for error handling in a serverless repository context. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The structure and content are typical for such purposes, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. It appears safe and intended solely for error reporting.",
