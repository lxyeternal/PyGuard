{
  "purpose": "Define and validate an application permission policy for SAR with specific principals and actions.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'principals' and 'actions' parameters provided to the class instance.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, but the validate method raises errors if data is invalid; no unsafe operations are performed.",
  "flows": "Principals and actions are assigned during initialization, then validated to ensure correct formats and supported actions; validated data is used to generate a statement.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The use of regex for principal validation is straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing permission policies, validating AWS account IDs or wildcards, and supported actions. It performs validation of inputs, raising exceptions for invalid formats or unsupported actions. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. It adheres to standard coding practices without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward permission policy class with validation and conversion methods. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use, with proper validation checks in place.",
