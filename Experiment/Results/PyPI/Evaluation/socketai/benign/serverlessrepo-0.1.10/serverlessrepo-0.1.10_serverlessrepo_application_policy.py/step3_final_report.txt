{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for managing and validating SAR application policies, specifically principals and actions, ensuring correct formatting and supported values.",
  "sources": "Principals list input, actions list input",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or network operations",
  "flows": "Principals and actions are validated locally; no data flows to external systems",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward validation with regex and set operations",
  "analysis": "The code performs input validation for principals using a regex pattern to match 12-digit AWS IDs or '*', and checks that actions are within a predefined supported list. It raises exceptions for invalid data and converts valid data into a policy statement dictionary. No external calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation are present. The validation logic is standard and secure, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for policy validation. It performs necessary checks without any malicious intent or security flaws. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk.",
