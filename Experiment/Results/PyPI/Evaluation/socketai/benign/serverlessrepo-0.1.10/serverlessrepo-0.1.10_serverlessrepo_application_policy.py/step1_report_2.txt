  "purpose": "Define and validate SAR application permission policies including principals and actions, and convert them to statement dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'principals' and 'actions' provided during initialization, and the regex pattern '_PRINCIPAL_PATTERN'.",
  "sinks": "Validation methods and the 'to_statement' method, which output validated data structures.",
  "flows": "Input 'principals' and 'actions' -> 'validate()' method checks formats and supported actions -> 'to_statement()' generates policy dictionary from validated data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no external network calls or obfuscated code; simple pattern matching; no suspicious logic or external dependencies beyond standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing policy data with validation checks for AWS account IDs and supported actions. It uses regex for principal validation and compares actions against a whitelist. No dynamic code execution, external network access, or data leaks are present. The validation logic is straightforward and intended solely for data correctness. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, secure implementation of policy validation and formatting without malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly performs data validation and formatting, with no external communications or hidden functionalities.",
