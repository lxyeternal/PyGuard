{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for managing application policies related to AWS SAR permissions, including validation and conversion to policy statements.",
  "sources": "Principals and actions provided during class initialization, and the regex pattern for principal validation.",
  "sinks": "The validation method raises exceptions if data is invalid; no data is sent elsewhere or over the network.",
  "flows": "Input data (principals and actions) flow through validation, potentially raising errors if invalid; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected. The regex pattern is straightforward and safe.",
  "analysis": "The class encapsulates policy data, validates input formats (AWS account IDs or '*'), and ensures only supported actions are used. Validation raises custom exceptions on invalid data. No external system calls, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The code appears to be a well-structured, purpose-specific utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard policy management class with input validation and data formatting. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
