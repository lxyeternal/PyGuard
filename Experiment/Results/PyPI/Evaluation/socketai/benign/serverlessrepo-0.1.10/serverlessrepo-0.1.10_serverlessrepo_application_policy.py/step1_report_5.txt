{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for managing and validating application permissions for SAR, including principal and action validation and conversion to policy statements.",
  "sources": "Input data from 'principals' and 'actions' parameters, especially during validation.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sinks; the code primarily validates data and returns a dictionary.",
  "flows": "Principals and actions are validated and processed within the class; no data is transmitted externally or used in dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The code performs standard validation and data structuring.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class to manage application policies with validation for AWS account IDs and supported actions. Validation ensures principals match a pattern or are '*', and actions are among predefined supported actions. No external inputs or outputs are insecurely handled. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious operations are present. The logic is straightforward, aimed at maintaining policy integrity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, focusing on input validation and policy statement creation without any malicious intent or security risks. No malware or malicious behavior identified.",
