{
  "purpose": "Define and validate SAR application permission policies including principals and actions, and convert to a statement format.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters 'principals' and 'actions', regex pattern matching in 'validate' method.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or external interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Input 'principals' flow through validation, matching against regex pattern; 'actions' checked against supported list; final data used in 'to_statement'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing application permission policies, validating input formats, and converting data to a dictionary. Validation ensures 'principals' are 12-digit AWS IDs or '*', and 'actions' are within supported actions. No external network calls, no data exfiltration, or suspicious operations are present. The regex pattern and validation logic are standard and straightforward. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation for handling policy data with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs input validation and data formatting without any suspicious or malicious actions.",
