  "purpose": "To set up a Python package for distribution by specifying metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, executing the contents of '__version__.py' in the 'serverlessrepo' directory.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is written to external systems or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Reading files (README.md and __version__.py) to extract package metadata, then passing this data to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec()' to execute the contents of '__version__.py', which can be risky if the file contains malicious code, but typical in setup scripts. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for package setup, reads package metadata from files, and defines dependencies. The critical point is the use of 'exec()' to evaluate '__version__.py'. If that file is tampered with, it could execute malicious code during setup. Otherwise, the code follows standard setup patterns without suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or malicious network activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with the only minor concern being the use of 'exec()' to evaluate a version file, which could be risky if that file is compromised. No malicious behavior or malware indicators are present.",
