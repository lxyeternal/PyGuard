{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file, reading the '__version__.py' file in the 'serverlessrepo' directory.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is processed or passed to dangerous functions.",
  "flows": "Reading files to obtain long description and version information; setting package configuration based on this data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to execute contents of '__version__.py'—potentially risky if the file contents are malicious, although standard in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files for metadata: 'README.md' and '__version__.py'. The 'exec' statement executes code from '__version__.py', which is a common pattern to import version info without importing the module directly. There are no apparent code injection points, and no untrusted data handling or network activity. The dependencies listed are standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected. The code is typical for Python package setup with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior. The use of 'exec' to load version information is a common pattern but could be considered a minor security concern if the '__version__.py' file were compromised. Overall, no malware or malicious activity is detected.",
