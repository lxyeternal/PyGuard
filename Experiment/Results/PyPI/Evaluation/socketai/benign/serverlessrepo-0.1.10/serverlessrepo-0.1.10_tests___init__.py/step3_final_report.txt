  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, files, user input, modules, external network activity.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, system commands, dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, files, user input) potentially lead to network or file sinks; dynamic code execution may facilitate malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Report 5 notes obfuscation, dynamic eval/exec, network activity; other reports show minimal obfuscation and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign code with low obfuscation and no malicious indicators, scoring malware near 0.1-0.2. Report 5 highlights behaviors typical of malicious scripts, with obfuscation (0.7), dynamic execution, and network activity, justifying higher suspicion. Scores are consistent with behaviors; the overall assessment suggests low to moderate risk, with Report 5 warranting further review.",
  "conclusion": "The majority of code appears safe with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5 exhibits behaviors that merit caution, justifying higher scores. Overall, the scoring aligns with observed behaviors; continued monitoring and manual review of suspicious patterns recommended.",
