  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security issues, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard client library for Google Cloud Video Intelligence API, environment variables influence configuration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flows directly into sensitive areas; environment variables influence endpoint and credentials.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. Use of environment variables and credential handling aligns with best practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, well-structured code, no signs of malware or sabotage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low, reflecting minimal configuration risk).\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable. The code is standard SDK code with no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard client library, environment variables, and request parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct processing of untrusted data; credential info is appended to error details for debugging.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK, secure handling, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. The high confidence aligns with the thorough analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Client setup, environment variables, credentials, request handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard request flow; environment variables influence endpoint selection.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard SDK, no sabotage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score than previous due to the complexity of environment variable handling, but still reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar client SDK, environment variables, credential management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard request flow; no suspicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK, secure handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate, consistent with the previous reports.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—client SDK, environment variables, request parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows; environment variables influence configuration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard SDK code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The code is a standard client SDK with no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, reflecting typical configuration and environment variable handling, which is standard for SDKs.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is transparent, well-structured, and standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Minimal configuration risk; environment variables are used as intended.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are reasonable given the code. There are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or sabotage. The code is a legitimate, secure client library for Google Cloud Video Intelligence API.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that environment variables and credentials are managed securely in deployment environments, but this is standard practice and not indicative of malicious intent.",
