  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard API client setup, environment variables, credential handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data flows; environment variables influence configuration, not data processing.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation. Uses standard practices.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, well-structured client library with no signs of malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low, due to environment variable reliance but no malicious intent).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a standard SDK component with no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard environment variables and credential sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious data flows; credential info added only for debugging.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No backdoors or obfuscation; standard SDK pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent, legitimate SDK code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious activity detected; the code is typical for SDKs.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on environment variables, credential management, endpoint configuration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Environment variables influence endpoint selection and credentials; request flows into API.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or backdoors; standard handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, secure client library.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (slightly higher, but still low, possibly due to environment variable complexity).\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with standard SDK practices. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar pattern, environment variables, credential handling, transport setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data processing outside API requests; environment variables for configuration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, no suspicious network activity, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure, legitimate SDK code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings. No malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—environment variables, credentials, request parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flow; environment variables for configuration only.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate client SDK.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is correct; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, which is consistent; the code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1–0.2), mainly reflecting the use of environment variables and credential handling, which are standard in SDKs but could pose configuration risks if misused.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — The code is transparent and well-structured.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Low, primarily due to environment variable reliance and credential management, which are standard but should be used carefully.\n\n**Note:** The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. There are no indications of sabotage or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard client library for Google Cloud Video Intelligence API. It handles credentials, environment configurations, and API requests securely and transparently. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The low risk score reflects typical SDK configuration complexity but does not indicate any security threat.",
