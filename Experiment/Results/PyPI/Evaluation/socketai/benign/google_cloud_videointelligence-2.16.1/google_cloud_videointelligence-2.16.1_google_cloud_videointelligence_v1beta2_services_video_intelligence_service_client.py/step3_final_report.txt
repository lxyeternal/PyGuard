{
  "purpose": "This code implements a client library for Google Cloud Video Intelligence API, managing credentials, endpoints, and request handling in a standard, secure manner.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for configuration (e.g., API endpoint, credentials), function parameters for request data, environment variables for environment setup.",
  "sinks": "API request construction and transport layers; error handling appends credential info for debugging; no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (environment variables, function parameters) influence endpoint selection, credential sourcing, and request data; flows into API request execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code structure is clear and follows standard SDK patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, well-structured client SDK for Google Cloud Video Intelligence, with environment variables used for configuration, secure credential management, and standard request flows. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling is present. The environment variable handling aligns with best practices, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1) are consistent with the code's nature and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure client library with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score is justified given its standard SDK design and environment handling. All reports are accurate and consistent; no modifications are necessary.",
