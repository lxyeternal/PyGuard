  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, configuring metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from a local file, reads README file, discovers packages via setuptools.find_namespace_packages()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data handling",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local file -> passes metadata to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard practices used; minimal concern about reading version info from a file",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with explicit dependency declarations, package discovery, and metadata configuration. It performs no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The reading of version info from a local file is standard and not malicious. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores and assessments are accurate and justified.",
