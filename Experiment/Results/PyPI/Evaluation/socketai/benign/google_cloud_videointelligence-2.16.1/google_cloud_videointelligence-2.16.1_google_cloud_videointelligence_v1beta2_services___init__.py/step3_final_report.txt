  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies; the code is purely a comment header with standard licensing information.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments containing licensing and copyright notices. There are no functions, variables, data processing, or external interactions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate given the benign and static nature of the code. The content is standard boilerplate, posing no security or malware threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign licensing header with no executable logic or malicious intent. The reports correctly identify its nature and assign appropriate scores. No modifications are necessary, and the overall security assessment is that it poses no threat.",
