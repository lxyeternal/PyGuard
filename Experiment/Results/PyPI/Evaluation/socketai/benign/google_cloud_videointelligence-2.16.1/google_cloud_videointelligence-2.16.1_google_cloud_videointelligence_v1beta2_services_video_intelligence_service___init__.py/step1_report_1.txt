{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports for a video intelligence service client, facilitating import of synchronous and asynchronous client classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.async_client' and '.client', specifically 'VideoIntelligenceServiceAsyncClient' and 'VideoIntelligenceServiceClient'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform any data processing or network communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks are present; the code only defines imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs. It appears to be boilerplate module setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from local modules, defines an __all__ tuple for exports, and includes license and copyright comments. No dynamic code, user input handling, or network operations are present. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module setup for a Python package providing video intelligence client classes. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
