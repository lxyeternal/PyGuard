  "purpose": "Exporting classes for video intelligence service clients for use in other modules",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .async_client and .client",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file operations present",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code only imports and defines exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard module export pattern with licensing comments",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports two classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__. The licensing comments indicate proper licensing and do not contain suspicious or obfuscated content. No data input, no untrusted data handling, no suspicious functions, no network or file system operations. The structure is straightforward and typical for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module defining exports for client classes. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
