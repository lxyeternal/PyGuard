{
  "purpose": "This code defines module metadata and imports two classes related to video intelligence services, exposing them for external use.",
  "sources": "The code does not read or process external input; it primarily imports classes from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply exports imported classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated elements are present. The license headers are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__, serving as a module initializer or API exposure script. There are no dynamic code executions, data processing, or network activities. It appears to be a typical Python package __init__.py file with standard licensing headers.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code. It functions solely as a module initializer for the package.",
