{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that exports classes for interacting with a video intelligence service, likely part of a larger SDK or client library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.async_client' and '.client'. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no functions or code that process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets detected. The structure is straightforward and consistent with standard SDK package files.",
  "analysis": "The code defines licensing information, imports two classes from sibling modules, and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic execution, user input handling, or suspicious behavior. The licensing comments indicate open-source licensing, and the code is typical for a Python package module.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks in this code snippet. It functions as a simple module interface for a video intelligence service client library.",
