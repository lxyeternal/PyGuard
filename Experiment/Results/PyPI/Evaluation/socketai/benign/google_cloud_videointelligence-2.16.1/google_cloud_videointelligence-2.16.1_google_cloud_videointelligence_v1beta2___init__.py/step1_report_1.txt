  "purpose": "This code defines an interface for Google Cloud Video Intelligence API client libraries and related data types, primarily for use in video annotation tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports the package version from google.cloud.videointelligence_v1beta2 and local modules for service clients and data types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output functions that could leak data or perform unsafe actions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the code only defines classes, imports, and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected. The code adheres to standard package definition practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version number from a package, defines service clients and data types for Google Cloud Video Intelligence API, and declares __all__ for exports. It is structured as a typical SDK module with no dynamic execution, no handling of untrusted inputs, and no suspicious patterns. The licensing and copyright comments are standard and do not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard open-source SDK module that defines imports and exports for Google Cloud Video Intelligence API client and data types. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate library component.",
