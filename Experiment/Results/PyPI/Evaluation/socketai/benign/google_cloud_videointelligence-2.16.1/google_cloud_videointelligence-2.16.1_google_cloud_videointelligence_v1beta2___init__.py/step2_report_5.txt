  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the reports and the code to assess the security implications.\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a standard SDK module, primarily consisting of import statements, class definitions, and module exports.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, user input handling, network communication, or any other behavior that could be malicious.\n   - The code does not include any obfuscated constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code appears to be a typical setup module for a client library, with no logical errors or flaws.\n   - The license comments and versioning are standard and do not introduce security concerns.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, transparent nature of the code.\n   - The overall security risk score is 0, aligning with the findings.\n\n4. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n   - The code does not process untrusted input or perform any runtime logic that could be exploited.\n   - The imports are static and come from trusted packages, with no indication of supply chain tampering.\n\n5. **Consistency and Reasonableness:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and justified based on the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n- Given the nature of the code, I agree with the current scores.\n- No changes are necessary; the code is a standard, safe SDK module.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a benign, standard SDK setup module with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
