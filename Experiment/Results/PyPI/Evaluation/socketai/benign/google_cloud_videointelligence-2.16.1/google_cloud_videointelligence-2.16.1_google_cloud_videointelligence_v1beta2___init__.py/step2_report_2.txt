  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Describes a module importing version info, service clients, and data types.\n- Sinks & Flows: No untrusted data sinks or data flows involving untrusted input.\n- Anomalies: None detected; standard package practices.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: The code is a typical SDK module with no runtime logic or data handling, no suspicious patterns.\n- Confidence & Scores: High confidence (1.0), no obfuscation, no malware, no security risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is standard SDK setup with no malicious elements.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Similar to above, importing from Google's SDK and version info.\n- Sinks & Flows: No data output or untrusted data processing.\n- Anomalies: None detected.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: No runtime logic, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns.\n- Scores: Consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid and accurate. No issues identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Importing and exposing API client components.\n- Sinks & Flows: No untrusted data flows.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Static import and export module, no data processing.\n- Scores: Appropriately low risk.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Similar to above, standard import/export setup.\n- Sinks & Flows: No external data processing.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: No executable logic, no suspicious patterns.\n- Scores: Appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose & Sources: Same pattern—importing from Google SDK.\n- Sinks & Flows: No untrusted data flows.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis & Conclusion: Purely static module setup, no malicious activity.\n- Scores: Correct.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\nAll reports consistently identify this code as a standard, benign SDK module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is static, primarily imports and exports, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final notes:** The reports are thorough and accurate. The code is a typical open-source SDK component, and there is no evidence to suggest any security concern.",
