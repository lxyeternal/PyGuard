  "purpose": "This code is a Python module that provides imports and exports for Google Cloud Video Intelligence API client libraries and related data types.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'google.cloud.videointelligence_v1beta2' package, including version info, client classes, and data type classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only imports and defines metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code is standard boilerplate for a client library module.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, license headers, and module-level definitions for exposing classes and constants. It imports version info, client classes, and data type definitions related to Google Cloud Video Intelligence API. The license and copyright notices are standard. There are no data handling, user input, or runtime behaviors that could introduce security risks. The structure and content indicate this is an SDK or library package, not executable code with malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign module for importing and exporting classes and constants related to Google Cloud Video Intelligence API. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
