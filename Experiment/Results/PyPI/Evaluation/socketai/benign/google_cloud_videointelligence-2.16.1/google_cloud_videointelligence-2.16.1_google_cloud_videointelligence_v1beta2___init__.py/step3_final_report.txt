  "purpose": "This code serves as a static setup module for the Google Cloud Video Intelligence SDK, importing version info, service clients, and data types, then defining module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements for version info, service clients, and data types from google.cloud.videointelligence_v1beta2.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static import/export without runtime data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; purely static module setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard license comments, straightforward imports, no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static SDK module with no dynamic execution, no user input, no network calls, and no runtime logic. It only imports and re-exports classes and constants. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The scores of malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign static nature. The high confidence score reflects certainty of its safety. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident based on static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign SDK setup module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
