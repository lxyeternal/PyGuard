  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - The provided code is purely a header or metadata section, consisting of comments with licensing information, copyright, and a version string.\n   - There are no executable statements, input/output operations, data processing, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The `__version__` variable is a straightforward string assignment, typical for version tracking.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No obfuscated code, hidden payloads, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are involved.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or malicious.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports agree that this is a benign, standard header with no security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that the code contains only licensing comments and a version string.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the content.\n\n4. **Potential Issues in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they do not seem to overlook any malicious behavior or hidden threats.\n   - No changes are necessary to the scoring or conclusions.\n\n5. **Overall Evaluation:**\n   - The code snippet is standard boilerplate for open-source projects.\n   - No security concerns, vulnerabilities, or malware are present.\n   - The scoring reflects this accurately.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n- The malware score remains at 0 because there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0 because the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The overall risk score remains at 0, indicating no security threat.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a typical header with licensing and version info.\n- All reports are accurate; no modifications needed.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided analysis and the code's nature.",
