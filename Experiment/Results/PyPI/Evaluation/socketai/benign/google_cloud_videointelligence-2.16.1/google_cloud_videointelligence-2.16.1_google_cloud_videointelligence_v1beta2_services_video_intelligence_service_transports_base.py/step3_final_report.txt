  "purpose": "Abstract transport class for Google Cloud Video Intelligence API, managing credentials, host configuration, and method wrapping with retries.",
  "sources": "Credential loading mechanisms, host string construction, method wrapping for API calls.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; primarily setup code.",
  "flows": "Credential sources flow into credential assignment; method wrapping applies to API methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, boilerplate implementation for a Google Cloud client transport. It handles credential management securely, sets up host configuration, and prepares method wrappers with retries. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. The credential handling follows best practices, and the code does not perform any external data exfiltration or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, standard, and free of malicious or suspicious content. The assigned malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The obfuscated score of 0 is appropriate given the clear, readable code. The security risk score of 0.1 reflects minimal inherent risk due to credential management but does not indicate any malicious intent.",
