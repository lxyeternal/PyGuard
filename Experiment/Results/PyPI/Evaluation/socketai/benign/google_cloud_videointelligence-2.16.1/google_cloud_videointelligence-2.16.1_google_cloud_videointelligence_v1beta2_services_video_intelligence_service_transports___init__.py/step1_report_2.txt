  "purpose": "Define and register transport classes for a Video Intelligence Service API client.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules and the creation of an ordered dictionary for transport registry.",
  "targets": "No explicit sinks, but potential for injection if import paths are manipulated externally or if the registry is used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules, then registry assignment adding transport classes to a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a registry of transport classes for a service client, importing necessary classes from local modules. It uses standard Python collections and type annotations. There are no signs of data leaks, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be part of a larger SDK or client library setup without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a standard setup for transport registration within a client library. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
