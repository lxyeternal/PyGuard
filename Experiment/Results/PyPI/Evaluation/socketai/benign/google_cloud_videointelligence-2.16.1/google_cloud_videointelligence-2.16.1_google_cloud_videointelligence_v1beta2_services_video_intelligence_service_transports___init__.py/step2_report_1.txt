  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is straightforward: imports classes, creates an ordered dictionary to register transport classes, and defines the module's public API.\n- No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The code appears to be part of a client SDK setup, which is standard practice.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, aligning with the lack of vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n**Potential concerns or assumptions:**\n\n- The only minor point is that the registry is static and relies on local class imports. If an attacker could manipulate the module or the import paths, they might inject malicious classes. However, this is outside the scope of the provided code and more about the environment or build process.\n- No evidence suggests that the code itself is malicious or intentionally insecure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured setup for registering transport classes in a client SDK.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and standard for SDK setup.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to suggest any adjustments, it would be only to clarify that the environment must be secure and that the import paths are trustworthy, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The current scores are appropriate.",
