{
  "purpose": "Define and register transport classes for the Video Intelligence Service API, facilitating multiple transport options.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest); static assignments to the _transport_registry dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external outputs; no user input or external data sources present.",
  "flows": "Code imports modules -> assigns transport classes to a registry -> exports identifiers via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes related to different transport mechanisms for a service. It then creates a dictionary to register these transport classes, mapping string identifiers to class objects. No external data inputs, user input, or dynamic code execution is present. The code structure appears standard for setting up a modular transport registry. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward setup for registering transport classes for a client library, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It simply organizes transport options for a service API.",
