  "purpose": "Register transport classes for the Video Intelligence Service SDK, enabling different communication protocols.",
  "sources": "Import statements for transport classes and the creation of a registry dictionary mapping protocol names to classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static code with no external input or output operations.",
  "flows": "The code maps string identifiers to class objects in a static dictionary; no dynamic data flow or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup module for registering transport classes, with standard imports, a static ordered dictionary, and explicit exports. It contains no user input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign, standard SDK pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK setup component for registering transport classes. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
