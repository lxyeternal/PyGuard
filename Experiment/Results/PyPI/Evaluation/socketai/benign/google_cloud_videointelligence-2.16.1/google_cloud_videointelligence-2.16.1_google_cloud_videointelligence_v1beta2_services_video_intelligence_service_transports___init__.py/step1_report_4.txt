  "purpose": "Define and register different transport classes for a Video Intelligence Service client.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules and the creation of a transport registry.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is used or leaked; no external data handling or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Imports and registry setup do not involve data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code primarily imports modules, creates a registry, and defines exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various transport classes and an interceptor from local modules, then creates an ordered dictionary to register these transport types. No user input, network activity, or external data processing occurs. The code is well-structured, adheres to licensing, and appears standard for a client library setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration. The only notable aspect is the straightforward registry of transport classes, which is typical in SDK implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup for registering transport mechanisms in a client library. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, well-structured, and safe.",
