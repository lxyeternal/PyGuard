{
  "purpose": "The code defines a registry for different transport classes for a video intelligence service, including gRPC and REST implementations, and sets up module exports.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "targets": "No sinks or data outputs involving untrusted data or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only sets up class references and an ordered dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secret keys, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code or unusual logic detected. The code is straightforward setup code with imports and a registry.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and functions, then creates a registry dictionary mapping string keys to transport classes. It sets up an ordered dictionary with transport class mappings, then defines the module's public API via __all__. The license comments are standard and do not influence security. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module setup for a client library, establishing transport class mappings without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard in structure.",
