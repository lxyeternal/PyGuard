{
  "purpose": "Define and compile a registry of transport classes for a video intelligence service SDK, including gRPC and REST implementations.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class and variable definitions, and registry population.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only sets up class references and a registry.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only involves static imports and registry setup without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code follows standard SDK design patterns without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific transport classes and creates an ordered dictionary to register these classes under specific keys. No input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. The code's structure is straightforward, aimed at modular transport registration. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard SDK transport registry setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a client library for a video intelligence service.",
