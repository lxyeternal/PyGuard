{
  "purpose": "Extension of Pygments and Sphinx for enhanced syntax highlighting, including highlighting added/removed lines and placeholders with custom HTML tags.",
  "sources": "Token streams, configuration options (hl_text, hl_added, hl_removed), regex matching for placeholders.",
  "sinks": "HTML output with <mark>, <ins>, <del>, and <generic.emph> tags; no external data transmission or system modification.",
  "flows": "Source tokens are filtered and transformed into HTML with custom tags based on line numbers and placeholder matches.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code responsibly extends Pygments and Sphinx for styling purposes, using standard APIs, regex, and token filtering. It does not perform any malicious actions or external communications. The regex and HTML modifications could, in theory, be misused if options are maliciously crafted, but no active threat is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured extension aimed at improving documentation styling. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.",
