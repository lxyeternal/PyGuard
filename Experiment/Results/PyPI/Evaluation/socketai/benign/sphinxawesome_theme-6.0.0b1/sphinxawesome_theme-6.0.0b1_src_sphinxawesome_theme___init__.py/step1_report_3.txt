{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a custom Sphinx theme called 'sphinxawesome_theme', configuring various theme options, registering directives, and connecting event handlers for theme integration and customization during the documentation build process.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries, third-party Sphinx modules, and local modules; the 'version' function to retrieve package version; configuration options like 'app.config.extensions' and 'app.connect' event handlers; reading theme option attributes and paths.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks related to untrusted data, user input, or network communication; configuration paths and event handlers are used for theme setup and customization, not for processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Code initializes version info from package metadata; registers directives; modifies Sphinx builder classes; conditionally adds CSS/JS files based on extensions; connects various event handlers for theme customization; sets static properties for JSON HTML builder.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. The code performs standard setup tasks for a Sphinx theme without involving external data sources or unsafe operations.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily functions to integrate and configure a Sphinx theme. It registers directives, adjusts builder classes, and hooks into Sphinx events for customizing documentation output. The use of 'version' from 'importlib.metadata' is standard; conditional CSS/JS inclusion based on extensions is common in theme setup. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or backdoors was found. The code does not execute untrusted input or perform network operations. The overall structure aligns with typical Sphinx theme configuration patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Sphinx theme setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard configuration and extension hooking for theme customization. The likelihood of malicious behavior is very low.",
