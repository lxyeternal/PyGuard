  "conclusion": "The code is a benign customization script for Sphinx documentation, manipulating the TOC structure internally without any malicious intent or security risks. The use of internal APIs could cause stability issues if Sphinx updates, but this does not constitute a security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to reliance on internal, private attributes."
