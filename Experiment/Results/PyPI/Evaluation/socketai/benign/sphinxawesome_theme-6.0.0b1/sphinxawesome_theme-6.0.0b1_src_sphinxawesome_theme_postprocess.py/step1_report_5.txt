{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to post-process HTML files generated by Sphinx documentation, performing modifications such as making navigation collapsible, adding external link icons, and cleaning comments.",
  "sources": "Reading HTML files from disk (get_html_files), reading individual HTML files (open(html_filename)), reading SVG icons embedded as strings",
  "sinks": "Writing modified HTML back to disk (write to html_filename)",
  "flows": "Read HTML file -> Parse with BeautifulSoup -> Perform in-place modifications -> Write back to disk",
  "anomalies": "Use of inline SVG icons embedded as strings is benign; no hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No dynamic execution or obfuscation present. No external data sources or untrusted input handling observed beyond file I/O, which is typical for static post-processing.",
  "analysis": "The code processes static HTML files, parses and modifies the DOM tree with BeautifulSoup, and saves changes. No input from untrusted sources is directly processed. Modifications include UI enhancements and comment removal, all performed in place. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The SVG icons are embedded static strings, not fetched externally or used maliciously. Functions like 'external_links' append SVG icons, but these are predefined icons, not malicious payloads. No code injection, dynamic code execution, or environment variable misuse observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard post-processing of HTML files for documentation enhancement without any malicious intent or security risks. It is safe, with no evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities based on static analysis.",
