{
  "purpose": "The code post-processes HTML files generated by Sphinx, performing DOM modifications such as making navigation collapsible, adding copy-to-clipboard links, external link icons, removing empty toctree divs, and stripping comments to enhance documentation UI.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML files from disk, parses them with BeautifulSoup, and accesses elements like links, divs, comments, and SVG strings within the code.",
  "sinks": "Modifies DOM elements by adding classes, attributes, event handlers, and SVG icons; writes the modified HTML back to files.",
  "flows": "Reads HTML files -> parses into BeautifulSoup -> performs DOM modifications (adding attributes, event handlers, SVGs, removing comments) -> writes back to disk.",
  "anomalies": "Uses inline JavaScript snippets for clipboard copying and toggling navigation; embeds static SVG icons as strings; no external network activity or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard static HTML post-processing for documentation purposes, involving DOM manipulations such as adding classes, attributes, inline event handlers, SVG icons, and removing comments. It does not include any network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. Inline JavaScript snippets are typical for UI features like copy-to-clipboard and toggling navigation. SVG icons are static strings embedded in the code. The file I/O is limited to reading and overwriting static HTML files. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious payloads are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with common practices for static site enhancements.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities in the code. It functions solely as a UI/UX enhancement tool for static HTML documentation. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate. The assessments across all reports are consistent and accurate.",
