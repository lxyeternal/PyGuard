  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard configuration, environment variables used for configuration, no suspicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clear, straightforward, no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low).  \n  *Justification:* The low risk score seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard, environment variables for IDs and API keys.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of environment variables for sensitive data, but this is common and acceptable.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; external URLs are typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 or 0.1.  \n  *Justification:* The risk score is very low, which is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, environment variables for configuration.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.  \n  *Justification:* Slightly higher risk score is reasonable, but still minimal.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, environment variables, static assets.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard configuration.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n  *Justification:* Slightly higher risk score, possibly due to dotenv.load_dotenv(), but still benign.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Configuration with environment variables, static assets, external links.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.  \n  *Justification:* Appropriate for a configuration script.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting low but not zero risk due to environment variable usage, which is standard practice.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**  \nYes. The code is a typical configuration script with environment variables for sensitive data, static assets, and no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 – 0.2 (minimal, primarily due to environment variable handling, which is standard)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and well-justified. The overall security posture of this code is benign, with no signs of supply chain risk or malicious intent.",
