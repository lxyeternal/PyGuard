  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation with theme options, extensions, and environment integrations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.getenv), imported modules, and static configuration data within the script.",
  "sinks": "Usage of environment variables (UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID, DOCSEARCH_APP_ID, DOCSEARCH_API_KEY, DOCSEARCH_INDEX_NAME) which could be manipulated externally, but are only used for configuration purposes.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read at load time and used for configuring third-party services; no data flows from untrusted sources into critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains static configuration data for the Sphinx documentation builder, including environment variable reads for API keys and IDs. No code injection, malicious data leaks, or suspicious network connections are evident. All imported modules are standard or trusted third-party, and environment variables are used only for configuration settings. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The environment variable usage is typical for configuration management and does not pose security risks in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard configuration file for Sphinx documentation, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. All data sources and sinks are used in a benign manner, primarily for configuration purposes.",
