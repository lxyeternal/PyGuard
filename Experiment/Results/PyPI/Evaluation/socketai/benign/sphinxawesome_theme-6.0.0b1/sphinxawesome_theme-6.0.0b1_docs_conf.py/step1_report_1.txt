  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation, including extensions, theme options, and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variables via os.getenv(), external modules imported (dotenv, sphinx), and static asset files.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables used in html_context and theme options; no direct data sinks for untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> html_context and theme options; no external or untrusted data flow leading to code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for configuration; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation detected. No dynamic code execution or network calls present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily loads configuration settings for Sphinx documentation. It imports environment variables for IDs and keys, which is typical for configuring external services. No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. All modules used are standard or well-known for configuration purposes. No malicious or suspicious behavior observed, and the code structure is clear and straightforward. No signs of obfuscation or malware. The overall behavior aligns with legitimate configuration tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration file for Sphinx with environment variable usage for configuration parameters. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. It appears safe and legitimate for its purpose.",
