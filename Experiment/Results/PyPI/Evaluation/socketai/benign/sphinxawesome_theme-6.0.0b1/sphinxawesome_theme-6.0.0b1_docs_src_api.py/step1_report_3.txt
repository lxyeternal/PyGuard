  "purpose": "A demonstration module for styling documentation generated by sphinx-autoapi, including user prompt and simple addition functions.",
  "sources": "The 'input' function for user prompts.",
  "sinks": "The 'input' function receives user input; no sinks for data leakage or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "User input flows from 'input' function to 'prompt' function return; addition function has straightforward data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code. No unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and consists of utility functions: 'prompt' for user interaction and 'add' for calculation. The 'prompt' function uses 'input' to receive user input, which is standard. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling. No external network calls, file operations, or credential manipulations are present. The structure and formatting are normal, and the code is simple and clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as intended for user interaction and simple arithmetic. No suspicious or malicious code elements are present.",
