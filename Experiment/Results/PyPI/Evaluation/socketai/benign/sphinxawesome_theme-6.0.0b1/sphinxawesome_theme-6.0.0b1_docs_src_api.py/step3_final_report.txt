  "purpose": "Demonstration of style configurations for sphinx-autoapi documentation.",
  "sources": "The function prompt() reads user input via input(), add() performs addition of two integers.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or transmission; input() reads untrusted user data.",
  "flows": "Input() (source) provides data that could be used downstream if processed insecurely, but in this code, no such processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of input() and addition; no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple functions: prompt() for CLI input and add() for addition. No external data sources, network, or file operations. Uses standard Python functions without obfuscation. Input() reads untrusted data, which could be a concern in larger systems, but in this isolated context, it is benign. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The code's purpose is demonstrative, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and serves as a utility or demonstration. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The use of input() does not constitute a security risk in this isolated context. The minor security concern related to untrusted input is acknowledged but does not imply actual vulnerability here.",
