  "purpose": "This module demonstrates style formatting for docs produced by sphinx-autoapi and provides utility functions for prompting user input and adding two integers.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input via the input() function.",
  "sinks": "The input() function, which can accept untrusted user input and potentially lead to data leakage or unexpected behavior if misused.",
  "flows": "User input captured by input() is directly returned or used in string formatting, with no further processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and serves documentation and utility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions: prompt() and add(). prompt() reads input from the user, which could be untrusted, but it only returns the input after stripping whitespace and does not perform any unsafe operations. add() simply returns the sum of two integers, with no external effects or security issues. There are no obfuscated parts, no code injection attempts, and no suspicious external communications or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for user prompting and arithmetic. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
