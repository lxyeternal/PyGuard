{
  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for prompting user input and adding two integers, primarily for demonstration purposes in documentation styles.",
  "sources": "User input via the input() function in prompt()",
  "sinks": "Input data from the user; no other external data sinks are present",
  "flows": "User input from input() flows into the return statement in prompt(), and static parameters in add()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements observed. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: prompt() and add(). prompt() reads user input via input(), which is a standard method. It optionally uses a default value if no input is provided. add() performs simple addition of two integers. No external data is read from or written to files, network, or environment variables. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code is detected. The use of input() is typical for command-line interfaces, and there is no indication of malicious intent or data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be intended solely for demonstration and user interaction, with no suspicious or harmful code present.",
