{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for prompting user input and adding two integers, likely for documentation or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the user via the input() function.",
  "sinks": "The input() function captures user input which could be used maliciously if this code is integrated into a larger system, but in isolation, it does not perform any harmful actions.",
  "flows": "User input is taken from the prompt() function and could flow into the return value; no other data flows to external systems or files.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The functions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a prompt() function that captures user input with a message and an optional default, returning the user's input or default if no input is provided. The add() function simply sums two integers and has no side effects. The only potential concern is the use of input() which, if misused in a broader context, could be exploited for malicious input handling, but in this isolated snippet, it is standard. No malicious or suspicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply provides basic input prompting and addition functionalities, suitable for documentation or demo purposes.",
