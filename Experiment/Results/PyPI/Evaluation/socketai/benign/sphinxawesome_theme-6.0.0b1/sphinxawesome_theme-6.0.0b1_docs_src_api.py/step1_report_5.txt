{
  "purpose": "This module demonstrates style formatting for docs produced by sphinx-autoapi, including user prompt and addition functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input via the input() function.",
  "sinks": "The input() function reads untrusted user input, which could be used maliciously if misused elsewhere.",
  "flows": "User input from input() flows into the return statement in prompt() function, with no further processing or external transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code uses standard Python functions and patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a prompt() function that gathers user input with optional default value, and an add() function for arithmetic addition. No external data sources, network connections, or system modifications are evident. The use of input() is standard for CLI applications; it does not transmit or leak data on its own. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be benign, straightforward, and intended solely for demonstration or utility purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of doc style formatting with standard input handling. There is no malware or malicious behavior detected. It presents no security risks in its current form.",
