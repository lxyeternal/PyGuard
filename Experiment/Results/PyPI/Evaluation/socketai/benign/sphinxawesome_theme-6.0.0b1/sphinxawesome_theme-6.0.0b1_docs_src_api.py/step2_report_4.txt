  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Two functions:\n  - `prompt()`: prompts user input with optional default, uses `input()`.\n  - `add()`: adds two integers.\n- No external data sources, no file/network operations.\n- No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.\n- Standard CLI interaction.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and observations:\n\n- **Presence of issues:**  \n  The code matches the description. No anomalies, no suspicious behaviors, no signs of obfuscation or malware. The `input()` function is used straightforwardly, which is typical for CLI utilities.\n\n- **Malware, obfuscated, security risk scores:**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0 or very close to zero. This aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n- **Potential concerns:**  \n  The only minor point is that `input()` reads untrusted user input, which could be exploited if integrated into a larger system, but in this isolated context, it is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, straightforward.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, slightly less confident (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct, no change needed.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, full confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- **Assessment:** Similar, notes that `input()` accepts untrusted input but is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- **Assessment:** Slightly more cautious, assigns `securityRisk=0.1` due to user input.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable, given the potential for untrusted input.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- **Are the scores consistent?**  \n  Yes. All reports appropriately rate malware and obfuscation as zero, given the code. The only variation is in the security risk score, which is justified by the use of `input()` accepting untrusted data.\n\n- **Are the justifications valid?**  \n  Yes. The code is simple, with no malicious intent, and the minor security concern is about untrusted input, which is standard for CLI utilities.\n\n- **Should any scores be adjusted?**  \n  No. The scores align well with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (due to untrusted input, but no actual vulnerability present)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- The code is benign, straightforward, and matches the descriptions.\n- The scores given are reasonable and consistent.\n- No further changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Overall estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.1   |\n\nThese reflect the code's simplicity and the minor security consideration regarding user input.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe code is a simple demonstration utility with no security risks or malicious behavior. The slight security risk score is justified but does not indicate any actual vulnerability.",
