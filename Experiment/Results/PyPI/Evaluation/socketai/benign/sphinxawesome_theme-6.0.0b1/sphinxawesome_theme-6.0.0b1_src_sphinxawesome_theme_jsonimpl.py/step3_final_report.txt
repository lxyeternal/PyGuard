  "purpose": "Provides custom JSON serialization for non-serializable objects by replacing them with empty strings.",
  "sources": "The 'default' method in AwesomeJSONEncoder, invoked during json.dumps and json.dump when encountering non-serializable objects.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input objects are passed to dump/dumps functions, which invoke the encoder's default method for non-serializable objects, replacing them with empty strings.",
  "anomalies": "The default() method unconditionally returns an empty string for any non-serializable object, which can mask data issues but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom JSON encoder that replaces all non-serializable objects with empty strings, potentially hiding errors. No external dependencies, network activity, or credential handling are present. The behavior is consistent and straightforward, with no malicious intent. The silent masking could lead to data integrity issues but does not constitute malicious activity. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1-0.2) are appropriate and justified. The code is benign but has a design flaw that could obscure data problems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility with a potentially risky design choice of silent data masking. No signs of malware or malicious activity are present. The current security risk is low but should be documented to avoid confusion. The scores are consistent with the analysis.",
