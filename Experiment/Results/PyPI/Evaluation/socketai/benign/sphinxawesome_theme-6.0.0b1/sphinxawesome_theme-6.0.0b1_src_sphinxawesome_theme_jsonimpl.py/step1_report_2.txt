{
  "purpose": "Provide custom JSON serialization and deserialization functions with a specific encoder that outputs empty strings for non-serializable objects.",
  "sources": "Input data for JSON serialization/deserialization functions (obj, file, *args, **kwargs).",
  "targets": "The code does not have any explicit sinks that handle untrusted data for malicious actions such as network transmission or file modification.",
  "flows": "Input data passed to dumps/load functions is processed by the custom encoder, with output written to file or returned as string; no external or untrusted sink manipulates data in a harmful way.",
  "anomalies": "The custom encoder's default method returns an empty string for non-serializable objects, which could lead to silent data loss or masking of issues, but not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom JSON serialization functions with a custom encoder that overrides the default method to return empty strings for objects that cannot be serialized normally. No external data handling, network communication, or system modification is present. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The silent fallback in the encoder might obscure errors but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for custom JSON serialization with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. Its main concern is potential silent data loss when encountering unserializable objects, but it does not pose security threats.",
