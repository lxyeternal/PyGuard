{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for analyzing Python type annotations, specifically checking for Union and Optional types, and verifying subclass compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations (__args__, get_origin, and type objects), and class/type information from the objects passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-critical actions; functions mainly perform type introspection.",
  "flows": "Input type annotations or objects flow through functions like _is_union, is_optional, and issubclassable to determine type properties or subclassability.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present; the code is standard for type analysis. The variable _compiled is unused but not suspicious. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for inspecting type annotations. It checks for Union types, whether a type is Optional, and if an object can be used with issubclass. It uses get_origin and __args__ to analyze types, and handles Python version differences by conditionally adding types.UnionType. No malicious behavior or malicious intent is evident; functions are purely introspective and safe. The code is straightforward, with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for type introspection, and contains no malware, security risks, or obfuscation. It functions solely to analyze Python type annotations and subclass compatibility.",
