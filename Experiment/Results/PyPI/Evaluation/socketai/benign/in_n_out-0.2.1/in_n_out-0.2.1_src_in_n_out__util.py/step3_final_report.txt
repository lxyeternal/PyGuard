{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for inspecting Python type annotations, specifically checking for Union and Optional types, and verifying if objects are class-issubclassable.",
  "sources": "The functions read type annotations (__args__, get_origin), class types (type, hasattr), and the variable _compiled (unused).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects; the code performs static analysis only.",
  "flows": "Type annotations are inspected via get_origin and __args__, with flows leading to boolean returns indicating type properties; no external data flows or system interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "The variable _compiled is defined but unused; no obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs safe, standard type introspection using Python's typing and types modules. It handles version differences for UnionType, checks if a type is a Union or Optional, and verifies if an object can be used with issubclass. No untrusted data processing, network, or file operations are involved. The functions are straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The variable _compiled is unused but benign. All evidence supports that the code is a benign utility for static type analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility for type inspection with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
