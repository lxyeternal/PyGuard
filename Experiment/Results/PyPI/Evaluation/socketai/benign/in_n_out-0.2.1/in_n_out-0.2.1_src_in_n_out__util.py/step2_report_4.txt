  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Utility functions for inspecting Python type annotations:\n  - `_is_union(type_)`: Checks if a type is a Union.\n  - `is_optional(type_)`: Checks if a type is Optional.\n  - `_split_union(type_)`: Splits a Union type into constituent types and indicates if NoneType is present.\n  - `issubclassable(obj)`: Checks if an object can be used as the second argument in `issubclass()`.\n\n**Security implications:**\n- The code performs static type analysis, inspecting type annotations and class relationships.\n- No data processing, network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution.\n- No handling of untrusted input that could lead to security issues.\n- No obfuscation, malicious logic, or backdoors.\n\n**Review of the reports:**\n- All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, safe, and solely for type introspection.\n- They correctly identify the absence of any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports consistently assign malware scores of 0 and security risk scores of 0.\n- The purpose, sources, sinks, and flows are all consistent with a static utility module.\n\n**Scores and justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, justified by the lack of any malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and uses standard idioms.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since the code does not perform any security-sensitive operations or handle untrusted data.\n\n**Potential discrepancies or points to challenge:**\n- The only minor point is the variable `_compiled`, which is unused. However, its presence does not introduce any risk; it's likely a placeholder or leftover.\n- The use of `cast` and `hasattr` is standard for version compatibility and does not pose security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The overall assessment aligns with the code's nature: a benign, standard utility for type analysis.\n- No changes needed to the scores or reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code performs static type inspection without any malicious or security-sensitive operations. All evidence points to benign utility functions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, non-obfuscated, and free from malware. No further action or scoring adjustments are necessary.",
