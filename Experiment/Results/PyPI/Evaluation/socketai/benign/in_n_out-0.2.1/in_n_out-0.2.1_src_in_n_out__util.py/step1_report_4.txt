{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for analyzing Python type annotations, specifically for detecting Union and Optional types, and checking issubclassability of objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads module attributes like `types.UnionType`, type objects, and the `__args__` attribute of type annotations.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any obvious sinks that could lead to data leaks or security breaches. No network, file, or sensitive data operations are present.",
  "flows": "The functions process type annotations and type objects to determine type characteristics without passing untrusted data to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no signs of obfuscation. The code is straightforward and purely for type inspection.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to detect if a type is a Union or Optional, using `get_origin()` and checking `__args__`. It also has a utility to test if an object is class-issubclassable. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are processed. There are no operations that could be exploited for malicious purposes or data exfiltration. The use of `hasattr()` and type checking is standard practice, and the code doesn't perform any network or file operations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign utility module for type inspection, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely for internal type analysis and does not pose any security threat.",
