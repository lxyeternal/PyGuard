{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling and analyzing Python type annotations, specifically for identifying Union and Optional types and checking subclassability.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations and type attributes such as `__args__`, `__origin__`, and attributes from the `types` module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the functions mainly process type information and perform safe checks like `issubclass` within try-except blocks.",
  "flows": "Type information is retrieved from annotations and attributes, then processed to determine if types are unions or optional; `issubclass` is used in a try-except to check subclassability.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. The code uses standard Python type introspection techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by setting up a Union types set and conditionally adding `types.UnionType` for compatibility with different Python versions. Functions `_is_union` and `_split_union` analyze whether a type is a Union or Optional type based on its origin and `__args__`. The `is_optional` function checks if a type is Optional by splitting it. The `issubclassable` function safely checks if an object can be used as a subclass argument, handling exceptions gracefully. All functions operate within the scope of type introspection and are consistent with normal Python typing practices. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility module for handling Python type annotations and does not contain malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe introspection with no signs of malicious activity.",
