  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for analyzing Python type annotations, specifically identifying Union and Optional types, and checking subclassability of objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads class types, type annotations, and the attributes of type objects such as __args__ and __origin__.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects, such as network transmission or file access.",
  "flows": "The functions process type objects, check their origins, and determine properties like optionality or subclassability without involving untrusted input or executing code that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and safe; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The import of 'types' and manipulation of __args__ and __origin__ are typical for type analysis.",
  "analysis": "The script defines utility functions to analyze Python type annotations, including detecting Union types, Optional types, and whether an object can be used as a subclass. It handles version-specific differences in Python's typing system, such as the presence of 'UnionType'. The code uses 'get_origin' to identify Union types and inspects '__args__' for NoneType to determine optionality. The issubclassable function attempts issubclass calls safely, catching TypeError to avoid exceptions. All operations are safe and typical for static type analysis, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focused solely on type annotation analysis, with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be utility code for type inspection, safe and free from malware.",
