{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for inspecting Python type annotations, specifically to check for Union types, Optionals, and issubclassability.",
  "sources": "The code reads attribute access on type objects (__args__, __origin__, hasattr) and calls functions like get_origin, getattr, issubclass.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no system calls, network access, or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "The functions process type objects internally; no flow from external input to sensitive functions or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the code is straightforward and does not contain any obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines helper functions for type introspection, primarily to identify Union and Optional types. It uses standard Python library functions and idioms. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects. The usage of 'cast' and 'hasattr' is standard for handling different Python versions. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or system modifications are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for type inspection with no malicious intent. It performs safe operations, mainly introspection, and does not interact with untrusted data or external systems.",
