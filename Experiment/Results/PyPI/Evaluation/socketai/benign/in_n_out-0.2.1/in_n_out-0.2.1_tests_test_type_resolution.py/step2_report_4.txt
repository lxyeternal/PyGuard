  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a set of tests for a type resolution library, verifying various scenarios such as unresolved annotations, partial functions, wrappers, and forward references.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious code detected. All functions and tests are standard, with no external data leaks, network activity, or code injection.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. No issues or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on unit tests for type hint resolution, including partial functions, wrappers, and unresolved annotations.\n- **Findings:** No malicious or suspicious patterns. Uses standard testing practices.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, tests for type hint resolution, including handling of forward references and partial functions.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity or malicious code. The code is purely for type analysis.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is sound. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions and tests for resolving Python type hints, focusing on static analysis.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, code injection, or external data handling.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a benign utility and test suite.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Test suite for type resolution, including unresolved and wrapped functions.\n- **Findings:** No malicious or suspicious behavior. Uses standard libraries.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (slightly higher due to mention of unresolved types, but still benign)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score due to unresolved annotations, but nothing malicious. The code remains safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, and the code is strictly for testing and utility purposes.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low; all reports support that the code is benign.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a collection of tests and utility functions for a type hint resolution library.\n- No external data, network activity, or malicious code is present.\n- Use of standard testing patterns, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution based on untrusted input.\n- Slightly elevated risk score in one report due to unresolved annotations, but this is typical in static analysis and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (No signs of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (Clear, readable code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1** (Minimal, primarily due to unresolved references which are common in type hints, not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a safe, well-structured test suite for a type resolution library, with no malicious or security concerns.",
