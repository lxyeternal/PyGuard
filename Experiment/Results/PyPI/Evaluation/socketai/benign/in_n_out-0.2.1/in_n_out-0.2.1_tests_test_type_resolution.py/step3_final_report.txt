{
  "purpose": "The code is a collection of unit tests for a type resolution library (`in_n_out`) that handles Python type hints, including forward references, partial functions, wrappers, and unresolved annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function annotations, type hints, and local namespace dictionaries used during signature resolution.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects; the code performs static analysis without executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Type hints and annotations are processed through functions like `resolve_type_hints`, `_resolve_sig_or_inform`, and `type_resolved_signature`, with data flowing from function definitions into resolution functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code uses standard libraries and patterns for static type analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of test functions verifying the behavior of a type hint resolution library. It involves handling forward references, partial functions, wrappers, and unresolved annotations. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved. The functions and tests are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The library functions are used as intended for static analysis, and no suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured test suite for a static type resolution library. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no obfuscation. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is zero.",
