{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a collection of test functions for a type resolution library related to Python annotations and function signatures.",
  "sources": "Reads include imported modules, function definitions, and calls to the library functions for resolution and testing.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data, perform network operations, or handle external inputs. It mainly invokes internal library functions with controlled parameters.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through function calls such as resolve_type_hints, type_resolved_signature, and _resolve_sig_or_inform, primarily resolving type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs. Use of standard testing patterns and functions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a set of tests for a type resolution library, utilizing controlled function signatures and type hints. No code injection, network calls, or sensitive data handling observed. Functions use local namespace injections and partial applications but are within expected testing scope. No obfuscation or malicious code detected. All operations are typical for a test suite verifying type resolution functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for a type hint resolution library with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It operates solely within a controlled testing environment, with no external data leakage, network activity, or suspicious logic.",
