{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for various type resolution functions in a Python module, focusing on resolving type hints, including forward references, partial functions, and wrapped functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function definitions, function signatures, and type hints, especially those specified as strings or involving unresolved references.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code does not write data to external systems or perform operations that could leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from defining test functions and functions with type annotations, through calling resolution functions like resolve_type_hints and type_resolved_signature, which process and interpret type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are present. The code relies on external libraries like pytest, functools, and in_n_out, which are standard for testing and type resolution tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a series of test functions validating the behavior of type resolution utilities, including handling unresolved or forward references, partial functions, and wrappers. It imports functions from a known package, performs standard type hint resolution, and raises expected exceptions when resolution fails. No suspicious or malicious constructs are evident. The code appears solely as a test suite for type hint handling without external or malicious influence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite focused on type hint resolution, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. It primarily tests handling of type annotations, including unresolved and wrapped functions, using standard libraries and known functions.",
