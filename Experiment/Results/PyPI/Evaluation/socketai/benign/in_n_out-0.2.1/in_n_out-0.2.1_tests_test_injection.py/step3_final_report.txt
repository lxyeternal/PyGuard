{
  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for a dependency injection framework, validating various injection scenarios, error handling, and edge cases using mocks, decorators, and context managers.",
  "sources": "Controlled registration of providers and processors within the test environment; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Injection points within test functions; no external data leaks or malicious flows.",
  "flows": "Sources (provider registrations) feed into injection decorators, which modify functions; no external or untrusted data flows to system or network.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured test suite for dependency injection, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It uses mocks and controlled dependency registration, with no external data or system interactions. The scores assigned in the original reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign and controlled nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, non-malicious, and free of obfuscation. It poses minimal security risk, primarily due to its role as a test suite. The original scoring is accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
