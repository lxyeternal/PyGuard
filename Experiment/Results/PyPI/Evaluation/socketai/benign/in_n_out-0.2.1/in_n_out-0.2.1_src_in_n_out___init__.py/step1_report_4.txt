{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a dependency injection framework with registration and processing functions, and handles version detection of the package.",
  "sources": "The only data input source is the importlib.metadata.version function call to retrieve package version information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data outputs or untrusted data processing points that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The flow involves retrieving the package version, then exposing a set of functions and classes for dependency injection and processing. No untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are present. The code structure is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information safely using importlib.metadata, with fallback to 'uninstalled' if the package is missing. It defines metadata about the package author and email. It imports various functions and classes from local modules, then exposes them via __all__. The code appears to be a typical setup for a Python package, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. There are no dynamic code executions, network connections, or data leaks. It adheres to standard practices for defining a Python module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module setup for dependency injection and processing, with no malicious or security-sensitive issues detected.",
