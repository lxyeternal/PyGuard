{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a dependency injection and result processing framework for Python, defining type aliases, importing modules, and exposing functions and classes for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads package version information via importlib.metadata and standard module imports.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network communication, file writes, or system modifications are present. No untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows involving untrusted data; the code mainly sets up imports and exposes functions and classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are detected. All imported modules and functions appear standard and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines package metadata, imports from various internal modules, and exposes a set of functions and classes via __all__. It includes a version check that gracefully defaults if the package is not installed. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are present. The module's purpose seems to be to provide dependency injection and processing capabilities. The use of standard library functions and straightforward import/export patterns indicates a benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Python module for dependency injection with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It primarily handles imports, version info, and function exposure.",
