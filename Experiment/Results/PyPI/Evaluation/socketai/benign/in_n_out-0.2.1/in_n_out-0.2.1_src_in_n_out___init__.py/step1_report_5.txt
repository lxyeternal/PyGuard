{
  "purpose": "The code provides a framework for dependency injection and result processing, defining types, version handling, metadata, and exporting functions and classes related to dependency management.",
  "sources": "The code reads package version information using importlib.metadata and metadata such as author and email. It imports internal modules and functions from local files.",
  "targets": "No explicit targets for untrusted data, but potential data flow exists through imported functions and classes.",
  "flows": "Version info and metadata are read at startup. Imported functions and classes could be invoked elsewhere, but no direct execution or data flow is visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code. The code appears straightforward, primarily setting up dependencies and metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes package metadata, imports various functions and classes from local modules, and defines an __all__ list for exports. The version is retrieved from package metadata, with fallback to 'uninstalled'. No untrusted input handling or external data processing is present. The structure appears typical for a Python package's __init__.py, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization module with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It sets up dependencies and exports functions/classes for dependency injection. No malicious or supply chain attack signals detected.",
