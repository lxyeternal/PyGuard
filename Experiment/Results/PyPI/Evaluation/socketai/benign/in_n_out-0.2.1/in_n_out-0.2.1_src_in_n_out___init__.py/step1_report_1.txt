{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a modular dependency injection framework with pluggable providers and processors, including version handling and imports of internal modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own package version via importlib.metadata and imports internal modules and functions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or exfiltrated; no network, file, or environment variable manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to importing functions and setting module-level variables; no external data or user input processing is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or dynamic execution observed. The version handling is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports functions from internal modules and sets version info. The version check uses importlib.metadata safely. No external inputs are processed dynamically, nor are there any network operations, code execution, or data leaks. The structure and content suggest a standard package initialization module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical, well-structured Python package initialization file with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It only imports functions and sets package metadata, posing no security threats.",
