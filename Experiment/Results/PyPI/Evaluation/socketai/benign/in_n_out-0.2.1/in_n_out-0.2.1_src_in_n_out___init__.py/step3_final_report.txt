{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package, setting version info, importing internal modules, and exposing functions for dependency injection and processing.",
  "sources": "Version retrieval via importlib.metadata, internal module imports",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network activity, or data leaks",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; imports and version checks are static",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package __init__.py, performing version detection, importing internal functions, and defining __all__. It does not process untrusted data, execute dynamic code, or perform network operations. All signals indicate a benign, standard setup module with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
