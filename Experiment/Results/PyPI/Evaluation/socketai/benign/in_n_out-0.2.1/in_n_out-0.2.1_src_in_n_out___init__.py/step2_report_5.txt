  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code, reasoning, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a package initialization with version handling and imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data processing or network activity observed.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard import and version retrieval.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes benign nature with high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. Overall reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, accurately describing the module.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states benign intent, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes version retrieval, import of internal modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or system modifications.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly identifies the code as benign, with slightly lower confidence (0.95) but still reasonable.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (a slight concern but justified as minimal).\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly conservative but justified. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description of version handling and module setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external interactions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is benign, high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as package setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly states benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, justified by the minor uncertainty about the code's safety but no actual malicious activity.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- The code is a standard package initialization module, with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- Given the absence of suspicious patterns, dynamic code execution, or external data handling, **the malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0**.\n- The risk score could be slightly above zero (e.g., 0.1) if we want to reflect minimal uncertainty, but given the evidence, 0 is justified.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if a conservative approach)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, and the reports' assessments are accurate. No supply chain security issues are present.",
