{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a dependency injection framework with providers and processors, managing imports, versioning, and exposing functions and classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'importlib.metadata', local modules (._global, ._store, ._type_resolution, ._util), and package metadata 'version'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or system effects are present. No network, file, or environment variable operations are visible.",
  "flows": "The code initializes module metadata, assigns functions and classes to __all__, and imports/exports symbols; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code primarily consists of standard import/export and version handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package initialization: obtaining version info, setting author metadata, importing local modules, and defining export symbols. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, or network operations. All imported modules and functions are typical for a Python package setup. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package initialization and API exposure module with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to standard practices for managing package metadata and exposing functions. The likelihood of malicious behavior is very low.",
