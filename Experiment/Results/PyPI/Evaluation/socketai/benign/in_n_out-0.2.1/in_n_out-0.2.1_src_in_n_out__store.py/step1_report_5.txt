{
  "purpose": "The code implements a dependency injection system with a store for managing providers and processors, enabling registration, retrieval, and injection of dependencies into functions, with context management for temporary registrations.",
  "sources": "Reads include function decorators, registration functions, and internal methods that process callback mappings, type hints, and function signatures. No external or untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Sinks include invocation of registered callbacks (providers and processors), registration/unregistration of callbacks, and dynamic injection of dependencies into functions. These are internal mechanisms for dependency management, not typical data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Flow involves registration of callbacks (providers/processors), building of type maps, dependency resolution during injection (calling providers), and execution of processors on data. No external network, file, or environment interactions are directly observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are visible. The code adheres to standard dependency injection patterns. The use of weak references to avoid strong callback references is standard practice. No obfuscated code, hidden network activities, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured, well-documented dependency injection framework with functions for registration, deregistration, injection, and processing of dependencies. It uses standard Python features such as decorators, context managers, type hints, and weak references. No code segments indicate malicious intent, external data exfiltration, or covert operations. The presence of comprehensive error handling and input validation further supports benign intent. Overall, the code appears to be a secure, modular dependency management system without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a dependency injection system intended for managing providers and processors within a Python application. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks are evident. It is designed for internal dependency management and adheres to best practices without including malicious code or external communication.",
