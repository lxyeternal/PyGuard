{
  "purpose": "The code implements a dependency injection framework with registration and retrieval of providers and processors, enabling injection of dependencies into functions at runtime.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data mainly from function annotations, function signatures, and registration parameters; no external or untrusted input sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved in data leakage, system modification, or network communication; no file system, network, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "Code flows include registration of callbacks, their storage in internal lists, and their invocation during dependency injection or processing functions. No untrusted data flow to sensitive sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution are observed. The code uses standard Python features for weak references and callback management. No obfuscated or misleading code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dependency injection system with classes for storing providers and processors, managing callback registration/deregistration, and injecting dependencies into functions. It includes mechanisms for registering providers/processors via decorators or direct calls, caching maps for efficient lookup, and weak reference handling for method callbacks. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is found. All code appears to be legitimate utility code for dependency management, with proper validation functions. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation of a dependency injection framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on the content analyzed. Its design is consistent with open-source, utility code for dependency management.",
