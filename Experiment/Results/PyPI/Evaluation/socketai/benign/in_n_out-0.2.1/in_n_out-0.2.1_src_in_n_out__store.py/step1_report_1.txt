{
  "purpose": "The code implements a dependency injection framework with stores, registration of providers and processors, and injection decorators for Python functions, enabling dynamic dependency resolution and processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function annotations, function signatures, and registration arguments when registering callbacks, as well as from internal attributes such as __code__, __annotations__, and __qualname__.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the execution of registered provider and processor callbacks, and the invocation of functions decorated with inject and inject_processors, which could lead to injection of malicious code if untrusted providers are registered.",
  "flows": "Sources such as type hints and registration data flow into callback registration and type resolution. Registered callbacks are stored and later invoked in iter_providers, iter_processors, provide, and process functions, potentially executing untrusted code during these invocations. The inject and inject_processors decorators use these flows to inject dependencies and process return values, respectively.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are present. The code uses weak references to avoid memory leaks with method callbacks, which is a standard pattern. The use of warnings and exception handling appears consistent with normal debugging and error management. The code does not contain obfuscated patterns, and all functions appear to serve legitimate dependency injection and processing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a dependency injection system with store management, callback registration, and injection decorators. It reads type annotations and signatures for dependency resolution, registers providers and processors with optional weights and subclass checks, and allows dynamic injection and processing at call time. The registration process uses weak references for methods, which is a safe pattern. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The use of standard Python features and patterns suggests a focus on modular and flexible dependency management. No suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or harmful side effects are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dependency injection framework for Python, with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It functions by registering and invoking provider and processor callbacks, with safety measures such as weak references. No malicious behaviors, hidden backdoors, or security exploits are detected. Overall, the code appears safe and purpose-driven.",
