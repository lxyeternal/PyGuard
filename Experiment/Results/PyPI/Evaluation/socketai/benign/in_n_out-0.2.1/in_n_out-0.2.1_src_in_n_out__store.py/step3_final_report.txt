  "purpose": "The code implements a dependency injection framework for Python, managing providers and processors for type-based dependency resolution and processing.",
  "sources": "Function annotations, registration data, internal attributes, and callback invocation points.",
  "sinks": "Execution of registered callbacks (providers and processors), dependency injection during function calls, and weak reference callbacks cleanup.",
  "flows": "Registration of callbacks → storage in internal lists → dependency resolution during injection or processing → callback invocation during provide/process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious external activity detected. Use of weak references for method callbacks is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured dependency injection system utilizing type hints, signatures, and context managers. It performs callback registration, validation, and invocation without any malicious payloads. The potential security concern is the registration of untrusted callbacks, which could execute arbitrary code, but this is inherent to callback-based systems and not indicative of malicious intent. No obfuscation or malicious code is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and typical usage scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate dependency injection framework with no embedded malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk reflects the potential for misuse if untrusted callbacks are registered, but this is a known and manageable aspect of such systems. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
