{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test functions for the 'in_n_out' dependency injection framework, verifying provider registration, resolution, decorators, and optional types.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data primarily from function parameters, decorators, and type hints within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or effects; the code does not process external inputs or produce outputs beyond test assertions.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves registering providers, retrieving them via 'provide', and asserting expected values, all within controlled test contexts.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution are present. The code is straightforward and standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple test functions that validate the behavior of a dependency injection system. It uses standard Python features like decorators, context managers, and type hints. No external data sources, network activity, or file operations are involved. The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The use of warnings and exceptions is for type hint enforcement, typical in such code. All signals indicate benign, test-only code with no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for the 'in_n_out' dependency injection framework. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and overall security risk is negligible. The scores are consistent with the code's purpose and content.",
