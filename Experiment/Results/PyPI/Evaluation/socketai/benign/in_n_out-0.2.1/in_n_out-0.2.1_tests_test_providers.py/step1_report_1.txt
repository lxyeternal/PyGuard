{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test functions for a dependency injection framework called 'in_n_out', testing provider registration, resolution, decorators, and optional types.",
  "sources": "Inputs come from test data (parameters, decorators, and function return values). No external data sources or user inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external outputs. No data leakage, external network communication, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Test functions call framework methods that register, resolve, and clear providers, but these are internal operations with no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution. Use of warnings for missing type hints is appropriate and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely for testing a dependency injection library. It registers and resolves providers, decorators, and optional types. No malicious code, external network activity, or data leaks are present. No suspicious behaviors such as backdoors, data theft, or harmful system modifications are detected. The code uses standard Python features, type hints, and testing libraries without any obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for a dependency injection framework with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It operates entirely within the test environment, with no external malicious behaviors or data leaks.",
