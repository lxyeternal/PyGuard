{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for a dependency injection or type registration system, verifying registration, type compatibility, and error handling using pytest and mocks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from test parameters and mock functions; no external data sources or untrusted inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "Mocked method calls and assertions; no data flows to external systems or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke store methods with various types, with mock objects verifying call behavior; flow is internal within tests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, well-structured testing code employing standard practices. It tests type registration, subclass relationships, and error handling without external dependencies or security-sensitive operations. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The use of mocks and parameterized tests aligns with typical testing environments. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe test suite with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
