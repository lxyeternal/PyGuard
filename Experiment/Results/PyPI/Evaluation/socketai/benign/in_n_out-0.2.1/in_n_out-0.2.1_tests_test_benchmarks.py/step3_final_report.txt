  "purpose": "Benchmark and verify 'in_n_out' functions for performance and correctness.",
  "sources": "Reads sys.argv, imports modules, uses 'ino' functions, lambda providers, and print statements.",
  "sinks": "Print statements, 'ino' function calls, benchmark functions.",
  "flows": "sys.argv -> conditional skip; lambda providers -> 'ino' inject/register functions; print statements within processors.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '...' in lambda functions as placeholders, which is valid but unusual in production code; no malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward pytest-based benchmarking suite for the 'in_n_out' dependency injection module. It uses standard testing constructs, lambda functions, and print statements. No external network, file, or environment modifications are evident. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code, is present. The code's purpose appears solely to benchmark performance. The use of '...' in lambdas is a placeholder and not suspicious. The command-line argument handling is typical for test control. Overall, the code is benign, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious benchmarking test suite for 'in_n_out'. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is 0.",
