  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is identified as a dependency injection utility with no malicious patterns. It relies on internal method calls, manipulates docstrings for documentation, and delegates to Store methods.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, considering dependency management code generally poses minimal security risk.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable; no issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing dependency registration and injection without malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — acceptable for dependency management code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.\n- **Verdict:** Valid, no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, dependency injection helpers with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — dependency code typically has low risk.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward.\n- **Verdict:** Correct evaluation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar findings; the only unusual activity is dynamic docstring modification, which is benign.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — dependency management is low risk.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous, no malicious activity, just dependency management and documentation enhancement.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, given the context.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent and appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, matching the code's clarity.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1-0.2), which is reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is transparent and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** **0.1-0.2** — minimal, typical for dependency management utilities.\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The reports are consistent, well-reasoned, and accurate. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — dependency injection code generally carries minimal risk unless misused, which is not evident here.\n\nThis code appears safe and legitimate, serving as a dependency injection utility with no malicious or obfuscated content.",
