{
  "purpose": "Provides dependency injection utilities such as registration, marking, iteration, and injection functions that delegate to Store class methods, facilitating dependency management within a project.",
  "sources": "Reads function docstrings, function parameters, and class attributes; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "Delegates calls to Store methods; no external code execution, network activity, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Function calls pass data from input parameters or docstrings to Store methods; no external or untrusted data flows outside internal delegation.",
  "anomalies": "Manipulation of docstrings within _add_store_to_doc is unusual but benign; no malicious or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward dependency injection utility, mainly wrapping Store class methods for registration, marking, iteration, and injection. It reads docstrings for documentation purposes and modifies them, which is harmless. No external data, code execution, or network activity is present. The code does not contain malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The delegation to Store methods assumes their safety. The overall structure is clear and standard for dependency management utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate dependency injection utility with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minor docstring modifications are benign. The security risk is very low, and the malware and obfuscated scores are zero. The overall assessment indicates the code is safe and well-structured.",
