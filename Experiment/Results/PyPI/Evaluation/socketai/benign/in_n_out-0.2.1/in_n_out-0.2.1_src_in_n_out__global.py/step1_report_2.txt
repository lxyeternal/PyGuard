{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of decorators and functions to register, mark, iterate, provide, process, and inject dependencies within a dependency injection framework, supporting multiple stores and global store management.",
  "sources": "Reading of function annotations, attributes from the Store class, and optional parameters such as store names or instances; no external input data reading.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to Store methods like register, register_provider, register_processor, mark_provider, mark_processor, iter_providers, iter_processors, provide, process, inject, inject_processors, which internally manipulate dependency registries and may execute code based on injected dependencies.",
  "flows": "Input parameters such as store identifiers or dependency providers/ processors flow into Store method calls which register, mark, or retrieve dependencies. Decorators and functions wrap or invoke Store methods with supplied arguments, enabling dependency registration or injection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code primarily delegates to Store class methods without including malicious logic. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors. Use of type annotations and docstrings appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a set of dependency management utilities that interface with a Store class for dependency injection purposes. It uses type annotations, decorators, and method delegation to manage dependency registration, marking, iteration, and injection. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system tampering are present. The code's complexity is limited to dependency management logic without any suspicious control flow or code execution. The use of string-based documentation and dynamic decoration is typical in such frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of dependency injection helpers, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external Store methods and primarily handles dependency registration and injection, which is common and safe in this context.",
