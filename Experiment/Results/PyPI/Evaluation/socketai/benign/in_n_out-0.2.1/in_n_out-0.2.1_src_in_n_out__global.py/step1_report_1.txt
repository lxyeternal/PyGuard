{
  "purpose": "This code provides a set of functions and decorators for registering, marking, iterating, and injecting dependencies in a store-based dependency injection system, primarily aimed at managing providers and processors in a Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads from function docstrings (via getattr(Store, func.__name__).__doc__), function arguments (e.g., store, provider, processor), and imported modules (e.g., _store, _type_resolution). No external data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "The main sinks are calls to methods on the store object (_store_or_global), which perform registration, marking, iteration, provision, and processing of dependencies. No direct data leaks or code execution points are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters such as store identifiers, provider functions, and processors flow into the _store_or_global function to obtain a Store instance, then into methods like register, mark_provider, mark_processor, etc. These methods manipulate the store but do not execute or evaluate external code or data in an unsafe manner.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code heavily relies on standard dependency injection patterns, uses decorators, and manipulates docstrings, which are common and not suspicious. No dynamic code execution or external network calls are present. The only minor concern could be the use of getattr for retrieving docstrings, but this is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines dependency injection utility functions with clear intent: registering providers/processors, marking them, iterating over stored providers/processors, providing instances, processing, and injecting dependencies. All data flows are confined within the system, with no external system calls, network operations, or code execution. The functions work with internal data structures and do not handle or evaluate untrusted data. The use of decorators and function overloading follows typical Python patterns for such frameworks. No signs of obfuscation, malicious data handling, or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate dependency injection utility module. It manages registration and dependency resolution internally without external data leakage or malicious behavior. There are no indicators of malware or malicious sabotage within this code fragment.",
