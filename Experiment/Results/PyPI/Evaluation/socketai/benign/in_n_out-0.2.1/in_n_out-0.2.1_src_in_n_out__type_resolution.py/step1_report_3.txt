{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for resolving and analyzing type hints, signatures, and annotations in Python functions and classes, primarily for type resolution, introspection, and dependency injection.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function signatures (__annotations__, __globals__, __qualname__), type hints via typing.get_type_hints, and optional namespace dictionaries provided as arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs modified signatures and type hints; potential sinks could be places where untrusted annotations or data are used to influence execution or type resolution, though no such behavior is explicitly implemented here.",
  "flows": "Type hints or annotations are read from functions and classes, then passed through resolve_type_hints and related functions, which may resolve or substitute annotations based on namespaces; no data is sent externally or processed insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected; the code only performs standard reflection, type hint resolution, and signature analysis without any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions for Python type hint resolution and signature analysis. It uses standard libraries such as typing, sys, and functools, with optional import of toolz. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks are present. The functions carefully resolve type hints, handle missing annotations, and provide mechanisms for class method inference. All operations are within normal reflection and type analysis domains, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The use of warnings and exceptions aligns with standard debugging and validation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility library for type hint and signature resolution. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It performs standard reflection, type hint resolution, and signature manipulation without any external data transmission or malicious side-effects.",
