{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for resolving and analyzing type hints and signatures of Python callables, mainly for purposes like dependency injection, type checking, and reflection.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, annotations, and optional namespace dictionaries; accesses function attributes such as __globals__, __qualname__, and __name__.",
  "sinks": "Uses functions like typing.get_type_hints() which can process potentially untrusted annotations; accesses function attributes and global variables; warnings and exceptions based on annotation resolution.",
  "flows": "Type hints and annotations are resolved from source locations (function parameters, __annotations__, global and local namespaces) and processed through resolve_type_hints and related functions to produce fully or partially resolved signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network actions. The code predominantly performs safe reflection and type resolution operations, with standard warnings and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on safely resolving type hints for functions, classes, or modules, including handling unresolvable annotations and class method inference. It uses standard Python features like get_type_hints, Signature, and function attributes. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious behavior detected. The import of 'toolz.curry' is optional and for functional programming utilities, which is benign. The code respects Python security practices, such as not evaluating untrusted code directly or executing arbitrary code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malware signatures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for type hint resolution and signature analysis, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs safe introspection and error handling to support dependency injection or type checking frameworks.",
