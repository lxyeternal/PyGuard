{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for resolving and analyzing Python type hints and function signatures, especially in the context of dependency injection and dynamic type resolution.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function arguments, function attributes (__qualname__, __globals__, __annotations__), and external modules (typing, sys).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points are limited; warnings and exceptions are raised for unresolved or problematic annotations. No direct data exfiltration or system modification points are evident.",
  "flows": "Type hints and function signatures flow from user-defined functions through resolution functions, possibly involving external namespace lookups and dynamic attribute inspection.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code uses standard libraries, with some dynamic resolution and warnings for unresolved types. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles type hint resolution and signature analysis, using standard Python features like inspect.Signature, typing.get_type_hints, and dynamic namespace management. It attempts to resolve type annotations accurately, including handling of class methods and unbound functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network communication, file manipulation, or obfuscated logic. The only noteworthy aspect is the dynamic resolution of class method 'self' parameters and comprehensive handling of unresolved annotations, which is benign in the context of type analysis. The use of warnings and exceptions appears to be for correct developer feedback rather than malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for Python type hint and signature analysis, with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. It operates within standard bounds of Python introspection and type resolution, with no suspicious network or system operations.",
