{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for resolving and analyzing Python type hints and function signatures, with features for handling unresolved annotations, type hint resolution, and class method inference.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations, function objects, class names, and globals from functions and modules.",
  "sinks": "Type hint resolution, signature analysis, and warnings could be triggered by untrusted input if misused, but no explicit sinks for malicious data are present.",
  "flows": "Type hints and function objects are passed to resolution functions, which process annotations and signatures; no external data or network flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present. The code uses standard libraries and patterns for type analysis and warning emission. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of utilities for handling Python type hints and function signatures. It employs standard practices like caching, safe unwrapping of partial functions, and conditional type hint resolution. There are no external data flows, network operations, or code execution. The functions focus on introspection and annotation handling, with proper error handling and warnings. All functions operate within the safe context of Python's introspection and typing modules. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. The logic is transparent and geared toward type analysis, not system manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, intended for type hint resolution and signature analysis. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage features. The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and has no suspicious patterns. Overall, it presents no security risks.",
