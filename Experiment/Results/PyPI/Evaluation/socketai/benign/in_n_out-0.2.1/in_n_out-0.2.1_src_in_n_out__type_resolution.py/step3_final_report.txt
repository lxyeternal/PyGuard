{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for resolving type hints and function signatures, handling partial functions, and facilitating dependency injection through introspection and type analysis.",
  "sources": "Function objects, annotations, global and local namespaces, and module attributes.",
  "sinks": "Internal reflection and type hint resolution; no external data leaks or malicious data flows.",
  "flows": "From function annotations and attributes to resolved type hints via get_type_hints, with internal processing and exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; standard use of reflection and typing modules.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility for introspection, type hint resolution, and signature analysis. It handles partial functions, class method inference, and provides error handling for unresolved annotations. No external data flow, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The use of warnings and exception handling is typical for such utilities. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for type hint and signature analysis with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
