      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, validation-focused utility for AWS SSM filters with incomplete parts. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The minor security risk score could be set to 0, but a slight elevation (around 0.1) is acceptable due to incomplete features, which are not security vulnerabilities."
