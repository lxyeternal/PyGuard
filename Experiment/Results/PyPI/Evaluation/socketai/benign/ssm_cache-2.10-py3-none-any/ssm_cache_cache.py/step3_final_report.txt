{
  "purpose": "Standard AWS SDK-based parameter management and caching wrapper for SSM and Secrets Manager, providing parameter retrieval, validation, refresh, and error handling.",
  "sources": "AWS SDK calls such as get_parameters, get_parameters_by_path, and get_paginator, which read parameters from AWS SSM and Secrets Manager.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures storing parameter values; no untrusted data flows into external systems or sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from AWS SDK responses into internal objects and caches; no external untrusted input influences security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Uses standard SDK patterns and validation.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard AWS SDK calls for parameter retrieval, with validation of paths and version parsing. Error handling and refresh logic are implemented correctly. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The code does not process untrusted user input in a way that would introduce vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0 due to absence of malicious behavior; obfuscation score is 0 as the code is clear; security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk from AWS interactions, which is justified. The code aligns with best practices for AWS parameter management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured AWS parameter cache and refresh system with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate given its purpose and implementation.",
