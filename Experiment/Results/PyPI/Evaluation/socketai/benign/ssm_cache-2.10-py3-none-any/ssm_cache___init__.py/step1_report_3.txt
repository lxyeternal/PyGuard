  "purpose": "Re-exporting classes and errors from the 'ssm_cache.cache' submodule for easier access.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'ssm_cache.cache' module.",
  "targets": "Potential use of imported classes and errors elsewhere in the project.",
  "flows": "Imported classes and errors are made available for other parts of the project; no data flow from untrusted sources in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward import/export statements with no complex logic, user input, or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and error definitions from a submodule within 'ssm_cache'. There is no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity. It serves solely as an alias or re-export, facilitating module interface. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The imported entities appear to be related to AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (SSM) interactions, likely used for managing secrets or configurations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign module that re-exports classes and error definitions for convenience. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code snippet.",
