  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements that re-export specific classes and exception types from a submodule. It does not execute any logic, handle input, or perform actions that could be malicious. The imported elements appear to be standard classes and error types related to AWS SSM parameters, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple re-export of classes and errors. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
