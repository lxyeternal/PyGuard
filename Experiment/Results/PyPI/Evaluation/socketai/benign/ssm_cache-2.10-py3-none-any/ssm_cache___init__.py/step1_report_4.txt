  "purpose": "Expose 'cache' submodule classes from the ssm_cache package for external use",
  "sources": "Import statements loading classes and errors from ssm_cache.cache",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code only imports classes and exceptions",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; straightforward import statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement that re-exports classes and exceptions from the ssm_cache.cache module. It contains no dynamic code, input handling, or potentially dangerous operations. All imported entities are likely used elsewhere in the project. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard import operation to expose classes and error types from a submodule. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security issues. The code is safe.",
