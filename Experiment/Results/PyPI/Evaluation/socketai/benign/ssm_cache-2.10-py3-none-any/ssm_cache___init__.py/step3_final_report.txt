  "purpose": "The code re-exports specific classes and error types from the ssm_cache.cache submodule to simplify access for consumers.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading from ssm_cache.cache module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external system interactions; purely import operations",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow, no untrusted input handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and re-export pattern",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements that re-export classes and exceptions related to AWS SSM parameters. There are no dynamic operations, data processing, network activity, or user input handling. The imported elements are standard classes and error types, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and lack of logic indicate a benign pattern typical in Python package design. All reports correctly identify this pattern as safe, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of zero, with high confidence. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present, and the code does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward re-export module with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
