{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for creating filters used in AWS SSM (Systems Manager) parameter querying, specifically for filtering by name, type, key ID, or path.",
  "sources": "Class initializers (__init__) and methods like value() and values() which accept input parameters to set filter criteria.",
  "sinks": "Methods like to_dict() that generate filter dictionaries, but there are no external data sinks or untrusted data effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (key, option, values) flow through validation in constructors and value() methods, then to internal state (_values). The to_dict() method outputs the filter configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. Notably, two classes (__init__ methods) raise NotImplementedError with messages referencing AWS, but no malicious intent is indicated by this. The code strictly performs data validation and object configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code provides structured classes for setting AWS SSM filters, with validation to prevent invalid configurations. No malicious or suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious data handling is present. The use of NotImplementedError indicates incomplete implementation, not malicious activity. No external network connections, no data exfiltration, or other malware behaviors are present. The code appears solely for filter configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for defining filter criteria for AWS SSM parameter queries. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The only notable aspect is the NotImplementedError in some classes, which indicates incomplete features, not malicious intent.",
