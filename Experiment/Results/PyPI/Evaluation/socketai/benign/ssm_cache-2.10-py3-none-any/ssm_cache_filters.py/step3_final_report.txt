  "purpose": "Defines AWS SSM parameter filters with validation and chainable value setting, including placeholders for unimplemented features.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for filter initialization and value methods.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input validation flows through constructor and value methods; no external data flow or malicious injection observed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of NotImplementedError placeholders for incomplete features; no suspicious code or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward validation for AWS SSM filters, with chainable methods and a limit of 50 values. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious patterns are present. The NotImplementedError indicates incomplete features but does not imply malicious intent. Validation logic is sound, and no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are detected. The incomplete features could cause runtime errors but do not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, validation-focused utility for AWS SSM filters with incomplete parts. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident. The minor security risk score could be set to 0, but a slight elevation (around 0.1) is acceptable due to incomplete features, which are not security vulnerabilities.",
