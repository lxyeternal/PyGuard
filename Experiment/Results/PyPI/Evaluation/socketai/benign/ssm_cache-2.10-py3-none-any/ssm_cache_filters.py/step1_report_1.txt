  "purpose": "Define classes for creating and managing filters for AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store queries.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters, class constants, method arguments, class attributes",
  "sinks": "Potentially none directly, but class methods that process input and generate dictionaries",
  "flows": "Input values are validated and stored in sets, then converted to dictionaries for further use",
  "anomalies": "Use of NotImplementedError indicates incomplete functionality; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected; no dynamic code execution or external network calls",
  "analysis": "The code establishes filter classes with validation to prevent invalid key or option values. The value methods limit the number of entries to 50. The classes are structured for filtering parameters, with some methods raising NotImplementedError, indicating incomplete features. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration, are present. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or access sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, incomplete implementation of filter classes for AWS Parameter Store with proper input validation. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
