  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code for potential issues, inconsistencies, or malicious indicators.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Defines filter classes for AWS SSM parameters.\n- Validates input keys and options.\n- Limits the number of values to 50.\n- Contains some unimplemented features raising NotImplementedError.\n- No external network or file operations.\n- No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** The report concludes no malicious intent, incomplete features, no suspicious code.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is reasonable; no security risk.\n- **Potential issue:** The use of NotImplementedError is noted but is standard for incomplete features.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes proper validation, no malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n- **Potential issue:** The NotImplementedError again is a placeholder, not malicious.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2), justified by incomplete features.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0 is consistent.\n- **Potential issue:** No suspicious code detected.\n- **Verdict:** Acceptable.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, no malicious behavior, only incomplete features.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk low.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Same as others, no malicious indicators.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk minimal.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with some incomplete features (NotImplementedError).\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The security risk scores are consistent with the code's state.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minor, due to incomplete features but no real security concern)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of filter classes for AWS SSM parameters, with proper validation and no malicious activity. The NotImplementedError indicates incomplete features, not malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The overall assessment remains that this code is safe, with no malware or obfuscation, and minimal security risk.",
