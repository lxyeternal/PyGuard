  "purpose": "Define classes for constructing filters used in AWS SSM parameter queries, with validation and chainable methods.",
  "sources": "Initialization methods (__init__), value setters (value, values), class methods (_validate_config), and external usage of to_dict() for serialization.",
  "sinks": "to_dict() method outputs filter dictionaries; no direct untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (filter values, options) flows from value/value() methods into internal state, then into to_dict() output.",
  "anomalies": "Raises NotImplementedError for certain classes (SSMFilterName, SSMFilterPath), which is not inherently malicious but indicates incomplete implementation; no suspicious code or dynamic code execution observed; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines filter classes with validation logic to restrict keys and options to predefined values, preventing injection or misuse. Chainable methods facilitate setting filter values with limits (max 50). The use of class constants and validation reduces risk of malicious input. No external data is fetched or executed; the serialization method (to_dict) outputs sanitized data structures. The NotImplementedError exceptions are standard placeholders, not malicious. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no indicators of malicious or sabotage behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides a secure, well-structured way to build filters for AWS SSM queries, with input validation and no evident malicious intent or backdoors. The presence of NotImplementedError suggests incomplete features but not malicious activity. No security risks or malware indications are detected.",
