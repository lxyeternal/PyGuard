{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for creating filters used in AWS SSM parameter management, allowing chainable filter configurations with validation.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from parameters passed to class constructors and methods (e.g., key, option, values). No external or untrusted input reading is evident.",
  "sinks": "Data is primarily stored in internal attributes; no data is sent over network, written to files, or used in system commands.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into constructors, then through validation methods, and into internal data structures. No external or untrusted data flow to dangerous sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of NotImplementedError for unimplemented features (not suspicious). No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code is straightforward, with standard validation and data management.",
  "analysis": "The code implements filter classes with validation, chainable methods, and to_dict conversion. No external input is processed from untrusted sources, nor is any output directed to external systems or networks. The presence of NotImplementedError suggests incomplete features but does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of filter classes for AWS SSM parameter filtering, with validation and chainable configuration. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, functioning as part of a larger, legitimate system. No security risks are evident.",
