{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of filter classes for managing parameters in an AWS Systems Manager (SSM) context, likely used for filtering resources or parameters based on various criteria.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to class constructors, method arguments such as key, option, and values, and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Methods that add values to internal sets, convert data to dictionaries, and validation routines; no direct data leaks or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (keys, options, values) flows into class constructors and methods, undergoing validation and being stored internally. No external data or untrusted sources are processed in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains 'NotImplementedError' exceptions in some classes, which might suggest incomplete implementations but not malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily class definitions for filters with validation logic. It performs input validation, enforces limits on values, and converts internal data to dictionaries. There are no external data interactions, network calls, or malicious constructs. The presence of 'NotImplementedError' indicates incomplete features but not malicious activity. No obfuscated or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, intentionally incomplete implementation of filter classes for AWS SSM, with proper validation and no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe from a security perspective based on the provided content.",
