  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Elasticsearch DSL error handling",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; exception class definitions only",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class inheritance and exception definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists of standard exception class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception and ValueError, used for error handling in Elasticsearch DSL contexts. There are no input sources, data processing, or external interactions. The exception classes are straightforward, with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard custom exception class definitions used for error handling. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
