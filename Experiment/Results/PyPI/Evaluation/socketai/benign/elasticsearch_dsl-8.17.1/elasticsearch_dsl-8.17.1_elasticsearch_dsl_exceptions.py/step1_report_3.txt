  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Elasticsearch DSL error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data input or untrusted sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present as the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as this code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions, inheriting from built-in and custom exceptions. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated elements are present. The licensing comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exception classes for Elasticsearch DSL, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
