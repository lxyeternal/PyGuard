  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Elasticsearch DSL error handling.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no output or data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from input to output or between functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions. There are no dynamic evaluations, external data reads, or suspicious behaviors. The classes are straightforward and serve as custom error types. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual code patterns are present. The license header indicates open-source licensing, which is typical for such modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions for error handling in an Elasticsearch DSL context. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks.",
