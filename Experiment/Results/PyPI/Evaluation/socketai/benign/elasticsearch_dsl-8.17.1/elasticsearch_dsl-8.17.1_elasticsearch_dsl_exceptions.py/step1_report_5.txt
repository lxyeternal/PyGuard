  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Elasticsearch DSL error handling",
  "sources": "No external input sources; exception classes are static definitions",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data processing or output",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; classes are only type definitions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears straightforward and standard for exception definitions",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from built-in Exception types for Elasticsearch DSL. No external inputs, data processing, or network communication occurs. The code is purely structural, defining exception types. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. It is a typical pattern for error handling in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for Elasticsearch DSL. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger library with no indicators of security issues.",
