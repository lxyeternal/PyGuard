  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Elasticsearch DSL.\n   - There are no dynamic elements, external data reads, network operations, or code that could be malicious.\n   - The classes inherit from standard Python exceptions, serving as error types.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Vulnerabilities**:\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The license header is standard for open-source projects and does not indicate malicious activity.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is straightforward, standard, and free of security risks.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), and the malware scores are zero.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: Correctly set to 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: Correctly set to 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign a risk of 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - Since the code is purely class definitions with no dynamic or external interactions, there's no reason to adjust the scores.\n   - The reports are consistent and justified in their assessments.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes.\n- The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and justified.\n- No further action or adjustment needed.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThis code is a typical, harmless set of exception class definitions with no security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
