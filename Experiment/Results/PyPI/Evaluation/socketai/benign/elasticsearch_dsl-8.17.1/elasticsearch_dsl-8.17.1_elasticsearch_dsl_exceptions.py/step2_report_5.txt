  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions inheriting from standard Python exceptions. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data reads, or other suspicious activities. All reports agree that the code is straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is just defining exception classes with no malicious or security-sensitive operations. No logical flaws or errors are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct as the code is clear and straightforward.  \n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's nature—no external interactions or vulnerabilities are present.  \n   - **Confidence Scores**: All are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no suspicious behavior, there is no justification for higher risk scores. The current scores are appropriate.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as harmless.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0  \n\nThe code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nBased on the detailed review, I agree with the provided assessments. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.",
