  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Elasticsearch DSL error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from standard Python exceptions; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward exception class definitions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to Elasticsearch DSL. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data reads, network operations, or obfuscation. The classes inherit from standard Python exceptions, serving as error types. The code is static, simple, and standard for error handling modules. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent and appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.",
