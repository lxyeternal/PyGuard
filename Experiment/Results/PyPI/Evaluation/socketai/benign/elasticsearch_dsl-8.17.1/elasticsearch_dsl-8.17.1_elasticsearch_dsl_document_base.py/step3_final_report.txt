{
  "purpose": "Defines classes and functions for Elasticsearch document modeling, including field mapping, serialization, and schema management, primarily for internal data handling within Elasticsearch integrations.",
  "sources": "Class attributes, annotations, method parameters, and internal mappings such as 'data', 'meta', and class-level attribute access.",
  "sinks": "Serialization via 'to_dict', attribute accessors, and data flow into internal mappings and external responses; no external command execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes and method inputs into internal mappings and serialization functions, with dynamic index handling and field processing.",
  "anomalies": "No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code employs standard patterns for data modeling and serialization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of an Elasticsearch document schema with class-based field definitions, mapping, and serialization. It handles annotations, type hints, and dynamic index names in a conventional manner. No external data exfiltration, command execution, or obfuscation techniques are present. The use of dynamic index names and data serialization is common in such frameworks and does not indicate malicious intent. The code structure is clear, well-documented, and follows standard practices, with no suspicious patterns or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Elasticsearch document modeling framework with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate given the context and content.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
