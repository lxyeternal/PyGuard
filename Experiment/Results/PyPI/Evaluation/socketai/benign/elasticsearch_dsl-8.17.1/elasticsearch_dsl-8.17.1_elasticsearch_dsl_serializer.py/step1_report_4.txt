  "purpose": "Custom JSON serializer extending Elasticsearch's JSONSerializer to handle AttrList objects and objects with a to_dict method.",
  "sources": "Importing AttrList from a local utils module; data parameter in default() method.",
  "sinks": "super().default(data) call, which may process data for serialization.",
  "flows": "Input data passed to default() -> processed via type checks -> potentially passed to superclass default() for serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Usage of custom data types is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code extends an existing serializer class, adding handling for AttrList objects and objects with to_dict methods, likely to facilitate custom data serialization. No input is taken from external sources such as environment variables or network. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The code relies on standard practices for extending serialization classes and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward extension of an Elasticsearch serializer with custom object handling, with no malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
