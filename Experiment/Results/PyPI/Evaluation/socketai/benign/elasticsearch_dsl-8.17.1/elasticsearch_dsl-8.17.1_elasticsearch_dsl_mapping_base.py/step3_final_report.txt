  "purpose": "Manage Elasticsearch mapping schemas, defining properties and metadata for document structures.",
  "sources": "Method parameters for defining fields, internal class attributes such as 'properties' and '_meta'.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Internal data flow within class methods for property and metadata management; no external untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of Elasticsearch schema management classes, handling properties, nested fields, and metadata. It performs internal data manipulations without external communication or code execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's operations are purely data structure management, with no network activity or external dependencies that could be exploited. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report is a conservative estimate, but given the benign nature, it could be considered 0. Overall, the code is safe, clear, and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious component for Elasticsearch schema management. All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The slight variation in security risk scores (0.1 vs. 0) is justified and does not indicate any real threat.",
