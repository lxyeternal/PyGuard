{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for constructing and managing Elasticsearch mapping properties, including nested structures and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through method parameters such as 'raw' dictionaries in '_update_from_dict' and 'mapping' in 'update', as well as through class attributes like 'properties' and '_meta'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks like network connections, file writes, or command execution. No data leaks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into internal class structures ('properties', '_meta'), and into dictionaries via 'to_dict' methods; no external data transmission is observed.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code appears standard and well-structured for its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures and methods for building Elasticsearch mappings. It utilizes standard Python features and safe patterns, such as type annotations, attribute access, and dictionary updates. No external input handling, network operations, or execution of external code is present. The only notable aspect is the careful merging and updating of nested structures, which does not pose security risks. The code does not perform any file or network I/O, nor does it execute untrusted code. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a typical implementation of Elasticsearch mapping builder classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs data structure management securely without external communication or unsafe operations.",
