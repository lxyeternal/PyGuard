  "purpose": "This code defines classes for managing Elasticsearch mappings and properties, including methods for constructing, updating, and serializing mapping configurations.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of untrusted input or data reading functions are present. The code primarily operates on internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leakage, system modification, or network activity. The code does not include any system commands, network calls, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "The code processes data through internal methods that manipulate mapping structures; no external data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be standard for managing data schemas. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises class definitions for handling Elasticsearch mappings and properties, with methods for constructing, updating, and serializing configurations. It utilizes safe Python features, external libraries are standard, and there are no indications of malicious behavior or data exfiltration. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or system commands are present. Overall, the code functions as a configuration management utility with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for managing Elasticsearch mapping schemas, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It operates solely on internal data structures and provides utility functions for configuration handling.",
