  "purpose": "This code is a module for an Elasticsearch DSL library in Python, providing imports, version info, and exported classes/functions for interacting with Elasticsearch.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.aggs, .analysis, .document, etc.), version variables, and the __all__ list defining public API.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no external input/output operations detected.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports various components and sets up metadata; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns identified. The code appears standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical package __init__.py file, defining imports, version info, and __all__ exports. It does not process user input, handle network operations, or include any malicious payloads. No suspicious code constructs or obfuscation detected. All imported modules are part of the library and are not suspicious by themselves. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script for an Elasticsearch Python client library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe based on the provided content.",
