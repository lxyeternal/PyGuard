  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'textwrap3', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "File content from 'README.rst' flows into 'long_description' parameter during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets observed. The 'lines' function is a simple helper for parsing lines; no obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a helper function 'lines' to parse text into lines, then calls 'setup()' with package metadata and configuration. It reads 'README.rst' for long description, which is a common practice. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical package setup operations securely.",
