  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'textwrap3' Python module.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long description, importing setup and open functions, defining the 'lines' helper function.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or user input handling, no output to external systems, no network activity.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard package setup operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard packaging libraries, defines a simple helper function, and calls setup() with metadata. The only I/O operation is reading a README file for description. The code structure and function calls are typical for Python packaging. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The setup parameters and dependencies are standard, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security concerns identified. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration file.",
