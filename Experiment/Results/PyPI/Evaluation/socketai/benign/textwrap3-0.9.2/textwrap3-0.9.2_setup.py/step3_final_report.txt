  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'textwrap3' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading local file 'README.rst' for long_description; static metadata and classifiers defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs are processed or generated.",
  "flows": "Static data from the script and local file; no dynamic or untrusted data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple helper function 'lines()' used for processing multi-line strings, which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static metadata, no user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The helper function 'lines()' processes static strings; reading 'README.rst' is standard. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
