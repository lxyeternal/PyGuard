{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'textwrap3' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long_description; static strings for package metadata and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration data is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The only dynamic aspect is reading a local file for description.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setup tools and defines a helper function 'lines' to process multi-line strings. The setup() function provides package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers, all of which are static strings or local file reads. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no external commands, network operations, or data handling beyond static configuration. The code appears to be a conventional setup script without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
