{
  "purpose": "A utility module for wrapping and filling text, derived from Python's standard textwrap library, with modifications for compatibility between Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to functions like wrap(), fill(), or methods within TextWrapper; no external data sources or network interactions.",
  "sinks": "Local string processing; regex operations and string transformations only, with no external data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through whitespace munging, regex splitting into chunks, and line wrapping logic within the module; no external data flow or system interaction occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Regex patterns are complex but serve standard Unicode text processing purposes. Compatibility shim (_translate) is standard for Python 2 support.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of text formatting utilities, similar to Python's textwrap module, with compatibility adjustments. Regexes are used for Unicode-aware splitting, and the _translate function supports Python 2. There are no external data sources, network activity, or system modifications. The regex complexity is typical for Unicode text handling, and no malicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The code performs in-memory string manipulations only, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard text formatting utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals and reports correctly identify it as safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
