{
  "purpose": "This code provides text wrapping, filling, dedenting, and indentation utilities for formatting strings in Python, originally copied and adapted from Python's standard library.",
  "sources": "Reads input text from function parameters such as 'text' in wrap, fill, dedent, and indent functions; internal regex patterns and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Uses regex search functions and string manipulations, but no direct data leaks, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Input text is processed through whitespace munging, splitting, and wrapping algorithms within class methods, with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward, with standard string and regex operations for text formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code is a modified version of Python's standard textwrap module, designed for text formatting tasks. It includes functions for wrapping, filling, dedenting, and indenting text, as well as handling special cases like long words and sentence-ending punctuation. The code uses regex patterns to split text into chunks, handles whitespace normalization, and provides options for customizing line width, indentation, and hyphenation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The code relies solely on string processing and regex operations, which are common for text formatting libraries.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, well-structured utility for text formatting, derived from Python's standard library. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is evident. It is safe to use from a security standpoint.",
