{
  "purpose": "This code provides utilities for text wrapping, filling, dedenting, and indentation, primarily to manipulate string formatting in Python.",
  "sources": "The code reads string inputs from function parameters such as 'text', 'chunks', and 'lines'. It also reads system information via 'sys.version_info'. The only external data source is input strings passed to functions like wrap(), fill(), dedent(), and indent().",
  "sinks": "The code processes input strings and outputs formatted strings or lists of strings. No sinks involve writing untrusted data to files, network, or system commands. No dangerous data leaks or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are taken in functions like wrap() or fill(), processed internally through whitespace munging and splitting, then formatted and returned. No data flows into or out of untrusted external systems or insecure environments.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive comments and legacy code support, but no suspicious or malicious logic. The only potentially unusual behavior is the '_translate()' shim for Python 2 compatibility, which is standard for backward compatibility and not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a well-documented string manipulation module for text formatting in Python, compatible with both Python 2 and 3. It uses regex for splitting and whitespace handling, with no external data sources or outputs that could be exploited. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data theft mechanisms. All code appears standard and benign, designed solely for string formatting tasks. The presence of version compatibility code and detailed comments indicates standard maintenance rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard text formatting utility library with no evidence of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It performs string manipulation securely, with no external data leaks or harmful behaviors.",
