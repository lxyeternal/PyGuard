{
  "purpose": "Provides text wrapping, filling, dedenting, and indentation utilities for processing strings.",
  "sources": "Reads input text from function parameters such as 'text' in wrap, fill, shorten, dedent, and indent functions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; the code manipulates strings and outputs processed text. No untrusted data flows to external systems or sensitive data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input text -> whitespace munging and splitting -> wrapping or formatting -> output strings.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a complex regex for splitting text into word chunks, but it is used solely for text processing, not malicious purposes. The _translate function provides a compatibility shim but does not process untrusted data for malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a modified version of Python's textwrap module, focused on text formatting functions like wrap, fill, dedent, and indent. It includes a compatibility shim for string translation across Python 2 and 3, and detailed regexes for splitting text into chunks, which are used only for text wrapping. No external data or network operations are performed. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The regex and whitespace translation are standard text processing techniques. The code does not contain hidden backdoors or obfuscated logic, and no suspicious side effects are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-documented text processing utility with no malicious or sabotage behavior. It operates solely on input strings for formatting purposes. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks.",
