{
  "purpose": "The code provides text wrapping, filling, dedenting, and indentation utilities for formatting strings, primarily aimed at improving text display in Python programs.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input strings provided to functions such as wrap(), fill(), dedent(), and indent(). It also reads Python version info via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any unsafe or insecure operations on untrusted data; there are no network operations, file writes, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through whitespace munging, splitting into chunks, and then wrapped or reformatted. The functions transform input data into formatted output without involving untrusted sources or sinks that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a shim for Python 2's str.translate() for compatibility, but this is benign. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. The regexes are used solely for text parsing, and no obfuscated or malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a well-documented, open-source text processing module adapted from Python's standard library. It manages whitespace, splits text into chunks, and formats text with various options. The functions operate purely on string data with no external communication, file operations, or system modifications. The presence of compatibility shims for older Python versions is standard and benign. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code is structured for text formatting only and contains no suspicious logic or data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, open-source text formatting library with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs string manipulation functions safely and without external side-effects.",
