{
  "purpose": "The code executes a shell command ('echo hello') and prints its output.",
  "sources": "The command array ['echo', 'hello'] which is passed to EasyProcess for execution.",
  "sinks": "The output of the subprocess stored in variable 's', then printed; potential for data leakage if command or output is malicious.",
  "flows": "Input command ['echo', 'hello'] -> EasyProcess executes the command -> stdout captured in 's' -> printed to console.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic execution beyond standard subprocess call. Usage of 'easyprocess' is typical for subprocess handling.",
  "analysis": "The code uses 'easyprocess' to run a simple 'echo' command, which is a benign operation. It captures and prints the output, with no signs of malicious behavior or data leakage. There are no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and typical for process invocation.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple subprocess call to print 'hello'. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The use of 'easyprocess' is standard for executing shell commands. Overall, it appears safe.",
