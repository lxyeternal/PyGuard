  "sources": "The command list ['echo', 'hello'] used in EasyProcess to run an external process.",
  "sinks": "The output of the external process captured in s and printed.",
  "flows": "Command list -> EasyProcess call -> process execution -> capture stdout -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard subprocess execution with a benign command.",
  "analysis": "The code uses EasyProcess to run a simple echo command, capturing and printing its output. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The command is benign and the use of EasyProcess is straightforward. There are no indicators of malicious intent or malicious code injection. The code does not connect to external servers, read sensitive data, or execute suspicious commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign script that runs an echo command and prints the output. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected.",
