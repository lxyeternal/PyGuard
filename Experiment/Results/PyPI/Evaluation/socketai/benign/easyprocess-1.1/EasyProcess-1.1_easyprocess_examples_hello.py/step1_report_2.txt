  "purpose": "To execute a simple shell command ('echo hello') and print its output.",
  "sources": "The 'cmd' list which contains the command and its arguments.",
  "sinks": "The 'EasyProcess' call which executes the command, and the 'print' statement that outputs the result.",
  "flows": "The command list 'cmd' flows into 'EasyProcess', which executes it and returns stdout; then stdout flows into the print statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses a fixed command, with no user input or external data feeding into the command execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'EasyProcess' library to run a shell command. The command is a static list containing 'echo' and 'hello', which is executed via EasyProcess. The output is captured and printed. The process involves no input from untrusted sources, no data leakage, and no suspicious behavior. It appears to be a straightforward execution of a harmless command.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and benign, executing a basic shell command to print 'hello'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
