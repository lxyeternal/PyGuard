{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves the current Python interpreter path and executes a command to get its version, then prints this information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python executable path from sys.executable.",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess command via EasyProcess to run the Python version command.",
  "flows": "sys.executable (source) → EasyProcess call with [python, '--version'] (sink) → stderr captured and printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code, or obfuscated constructs observed. Usage of EasyProcess is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and easyprocess modules, determines the current Python interpreter's path, then uses EasyProcess to run '[python, --version]'. It captures the standard error output from this command and prints it. The behavior is consistent with standard diagnostic scripts and does not perform any malicious actions such as network communication, data theft, or system modification. There are no suspicious patterns, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and solely used to display the current Python version. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected.",
