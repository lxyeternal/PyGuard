{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves and prints the current Python interpreter version by executing a subprocess command.",
  "sources": "sys.executable (reads the path of the current Python interpreter), EasyProcess call with [python, '--version'] (executes a subprocess command to get version info)",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call using EasyProcess which executes the version command and captures stderr",
  "flows": "sys.executable provides the path to the Python interpreter; EasyProcess executes the command and captures the output; the output is printed to the console",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of EasyProcess is straightforward and typical for subprocess execution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, retrieves the current Python executable path, and runs a subprocess to obtain and print the version. The subprocess call is made securely with no evident malicious intent. The code performs a benign task: displaying Python version info. No suspicious data flow, data leaks, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and intended for informational purposes. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It safely executes a subprocess to get the Python version and prints it.",
