  "purpose": "Retrieve and print the current Python interpreter's version information.",
  "sources": "sys.executable (Python interpreter path), standard input (not used), subprocess call via EasyProcess",
  "sinks": "stdout (printing version info), stderr (captured but not used for output)",
  "flows": "sys.executable -> subprocess call with '--version' -> stderr capture -> print output",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs a benign task: obtaining and printing the Python version. It uses standard modules and a third-party library for subprocess execution, which is safe in this context. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess call is simple and controlled. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report is justified as a conservative estimate but could be zero, as the code is safe in typical environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, performing a standard version check. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The scores assigned across reports are consistent with this assessment. No modifications are necessary; all scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.",
