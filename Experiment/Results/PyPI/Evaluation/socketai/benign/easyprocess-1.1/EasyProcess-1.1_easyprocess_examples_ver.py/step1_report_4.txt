{
  "purpose": "The code determines the current Python interpreter's version by executing it with the '--version' argument and printing the output.",
  "sources": "Reading the Python executable path from sys.executable and calling it with '--version' via EasyProcess.",
  "sinks": "Printing the version information to standard output.",
  "flows": "sys.executable -> EasyProcess call -> subprocess execution -> capturing stderr -> print output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of EasyProcess to run a subprocess is standard, though it may be unnecessary for simply getting the version.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and EasyProcess, then retrieves the current Python executable path. It creates an EasyProcess object to run the Python interpreter with '--version', capturing stderr output. The version information is then printed. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code simply executes a subprocess to get Python version info and outputs it, which is a benign operation. The use of EasyProcess is somewhat redundant for this simple task but does not introduce security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward operation to display the current Python version without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.",
