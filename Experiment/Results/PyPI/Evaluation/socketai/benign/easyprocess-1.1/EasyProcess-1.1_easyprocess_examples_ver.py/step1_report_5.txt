{
  "purpose": "The code aims to determine and print the current Python interpreter version by executing a subprocess command.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python executable path from sys.executable and executes it with the argument '--version' using EasyProcess.",
  "sinks": "The subprocess call may potentially be exploited if sys.executable is manipulated or if EasyProcess executes untrusted code, but in this context, it is just calling the Python version.",
  "flows": "sys.executable -> EasyProcess([python, '--version']) -> subprocess execution -> captures stderr -> printed output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The use of EasyProcess to execute a version command is standard. No obfuscation or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the current Python interpreter path from sys.executable and runs it with '--version' to obtain the version information. The output is captured from stderr and printed. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code performs a simple, benign operation. The only potential concern is reliance on sys.executable, but in normal operation, this is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward and benign script to fetch and display the Python version. No malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are evident.",
