{
  "purpose": "The code executes a subprocess to retrieve the current Python interpreter version and prints it.",
  "sources": "Reads the Python executable path from sys.executable and the subprocess output via EasyProcess.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the Python version to standard output; no untrusted data handling or external network interactions.",
  "flows": "sys.executable -> EasyProcess call -> subprocess execution -> captures stderr -> print output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no unusual or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and easyprocess, then runs the current Python interpreter with the --version argument. It captures the output (stderr) from the subprocess and prints it. The process appears standard, with no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The code is straightforward, with no hidden behaviors or suspicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to report the current Python version. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
