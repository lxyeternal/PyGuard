  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with some reports indicating obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting cautious scoring. The overall malware score is around 0.2-0.3, obfuscation around 0.6, and security risk approximately 0.4. No definitive malicious activity is confirmed, but suspicious features justify cautious scores."
