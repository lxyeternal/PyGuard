  "purpose": "This code appears to perform data processing and possibly interacts with external sources or user input, but the exact intent is unclear without additional context.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from function parameters, environment variables, or external files. No explicit input sources are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Data may be sent over network connections, written to files, or used in system commands; specific sinks are not explicitly shown here.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through internal processing functions, potentially reaching sinks like network or file I/O.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code features or suspicious dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, involving data processing routines. No suspicious external connections or malicious behavior are evident. The lack of context limits confidence, but based on visible content, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious intent. It seems to be a standard data processing module with no immediate security threats.",
