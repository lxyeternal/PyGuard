  "flows": "None; no data flow or processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code only sets a version string with no additional logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string variable __version__ to '1.1'. It is a common practice in Python packages for version control. There are no inputs, outputs, or suspicious behaviors. The simplicity suggests it's not malicious or obfuscated. No signs of malware, data leaks, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. It poses no threat.",
