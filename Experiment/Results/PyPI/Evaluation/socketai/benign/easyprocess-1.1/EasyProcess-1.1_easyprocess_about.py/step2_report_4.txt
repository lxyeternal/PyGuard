  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and verify the correctness of their assessments, the scoring, and the underlying logic.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no input operations, data processing, external calls, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code is straightforward and typical for package metadata.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly conclude that there are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, and the code is trivial, this is justified.\n   - No reason to increase the risk score; the code poses no security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that there's no malware activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they rely on the code's actual content.\n   - Their conclusions are justified.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks are present.\n\n### Overall Justification:\nGiven the code snippet is just a static assignment of a version string, the assessments and scores are accurate. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Estimated Score |\n|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                     |\n| Security Risk     | 0                     |\n\n**This is a benign, standard version declaration with no security implications.**",
