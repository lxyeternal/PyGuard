  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the reported issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code in all reports is: `__version__ = \"1.1\"`.\n\n- This is a straightforward assignment of a static string to a variable, typical in Python packages for versioning.\n\n- No input, no data processing, no external calls, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports correctly identify that the code is minimal and benign, with no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Identify and record errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions.\n\n- They correctly state that this is a standard version string assignment with no suspicious activity.\n\n- No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- All reports assign:\n\n  - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n  \n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  \n  - `malware`: 0\n  \n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n- No adjustments needed here.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Justify any risk score higher than 0.5**\n\n- All scores are zero, which is appropriate.\n\n- No risk is present, so no justification for higher scores.\n\n---\n\n**Step 5: Pay attention to the malware score**\n\n- All reports assign `malware`: 0.\n\n- This is correct; the code shows no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Step 6: Challenge any claims based on assumptions**\n\n- The reports assume that assigning a static version string is harmless, which is correct.\n\n- No unwarranted assumptions are made; the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n**Step 7: Ensure scores are consistent with the report**\n\n- The scores align with the analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, no security risk.\n\n- No inconsistencies observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Given the simplicity of the code and the thoroughness of the reports, I concur with their conclusions.**\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard version string assignment with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.",
