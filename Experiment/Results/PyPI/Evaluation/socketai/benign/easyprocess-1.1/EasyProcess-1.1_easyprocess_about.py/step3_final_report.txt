  "purpose": "Assign a version string to the package metadata variable __version__.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static assignment within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is a straightforward version string assignment with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single line: __version__ = \"1.1\". It is a standard practice for Python packages to declare version information. There are no inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors. The code is minimal, clear, and typical for package metadata. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores reflect this. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
