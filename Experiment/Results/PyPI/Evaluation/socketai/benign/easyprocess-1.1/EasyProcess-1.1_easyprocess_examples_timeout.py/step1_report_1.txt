{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates the use of the EasyProcess library to run a simple Python script with different timeout settings, printing the output.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system's Python executable path via sys.executable; it also reads input from the inline Python script (prog) executed through EasyProcess.",
  "sinks": "The code executes external processes with EasyProcess, capturing stdout. No untrusted input is directly passed to vulnerable functions; process execution is controlled.",
  "flows": "Source: sys.executable and inline Python script -> Sink: EasyProcess call with optional timeouts -> Output printed to console.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are detected. The script simply runs a Python subprocess with a timed delay.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and EasyProcess modules, retrieves the current Python interpreter path, defines a simple Python script that prints numbers 0 to 2 with delays, and executes this script three times with different timeout settings. The process outputs are captured and printed. The usage of EasyProcess is standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The script is benign, intended to demonstrate process handling with timeouts. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward demonstration of subprocess management using EasyProcess with different timeout values. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues. The process execution and output handling are standard and safe.",
