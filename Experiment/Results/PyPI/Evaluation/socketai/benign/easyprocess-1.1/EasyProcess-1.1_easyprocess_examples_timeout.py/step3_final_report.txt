  "purpose": "Demonstrates subprocess execution with timeouts using inline Python code.",
  "sources": "sys.executable for Python interpreter path; inline Python script executed via command line.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "Source (sys.executable) -> subprocess call with inline code -> output capture.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward subprocess execution, no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, retrieves the current Python interpreter path, defines a simple inline script that prints numbers with delays, and executes it three times with different timeouts. The script is benign, with no suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The subprocess calls are controlled and predictable, with no network activity or data exfiltration. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0, low security risk scores, and no obfuscation. The analysis aligns with the code's simplicity, and scores are consistent with the findings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of subprocess management with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate; the malware score should remain 0, obfuscation score 0, and overall security risk negligible (0). The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports can be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
