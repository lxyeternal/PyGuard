  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of subprocess management with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate; the malware score should remain 0, obfuscation score 0, and overall security risk negligible (0). The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports can be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
