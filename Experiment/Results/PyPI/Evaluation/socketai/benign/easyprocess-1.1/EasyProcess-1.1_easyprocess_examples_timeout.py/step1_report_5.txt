{
  "purpose": "This script demonstrates the use of the EasyProcess library to run a simple Python subprocess that prints numbers with delays, with different timeout settings.",
  "sources": "sys.executable (the current Python interpreter), input parameters to EasyProcess, and the code passed to Python via the -c argument",
  "sinks": "the subprocess execution via EasyProcess.call(), which could potentially be exploited if malicious code were supplied as input, but here the code is fixed",
  "flows": "sys.executable and the code string are passed as arguments to EasyProcess, which executes the code in a subprocess; the output is captured via stdout",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code dynamically runs a simple Python script with delays. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and EasyProcess, constructs a Python code string that prints numbers 0 to 2 with one-second delays, then runs this code three times with different timeout values: no timeout, 1.5 seconds, and 50 seconds. It captures and prints the output of each run. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The subprocess execution is standard, and the code being executed is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of subprocess handling with timeout control using EasyProcess. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. The usage appears safe and intentional.",
