  "purpose": "The code sets up a simple local HTTP server and fetches its default page content.",
  "sources": "Reading the current file path with __file__, importing modules, creating the web server code as a string.",
  "sinks": "Executing the server code within EasyProcess, opening a URL request to localhost:8080.",
  "flows": "Code changes directory -> starts server in a subprocess -> waits -> fetches page content from localhost -> outputs HTML.",
  "anomalies": "Use of EasyProcess to run a server in a subprocess, fetching local server content without validation or security measures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and prepares a web server code snippet that runs an HTTP server on port 8080. It changes the working directory to the script's directory. Using EasyProcess, it executes the server code in a subprocess, then sleeps briefly to allow server startup. Afterward, it makes an HTTP request to localhost:8080 and prints the response content. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The server code itself is benign, serving a basic HTTP server. The process flow appears to be for testing or local development purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a local HTTP server and retrieves its content, which appears to be intended for testing or development. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The use of subprocess to run a server locally is not inherently malicious but should be used with caution in production environments.",
