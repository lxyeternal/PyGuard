  "purpose": "Start a simple local HTTP server on port 8080 and fetch its content.",
  "sources": "os, sys, urllib.request, os.path, time.sleep, easyprocess.EasyProcess, the inlined webserver code",
  "sinks": "urllib.request.urlopen fetches data from the local server; no external untrusted data used in destructive operations",
  "flows": "Code changes directory -> Starts local server -> Waits -> Fetches content from localhost -> Prints HTML",
  "anomalies": "The server runs in a subprocess within the same script; no explicit input validation or security controls; server runs on all interfaces (host='') which could expose it if misused",
  "analysis": "The script changes the working directory to the script's directory, then starts a lightweight HTTP server on port 8080 in a subprocess using EasyProcess. It waits 2 seconds to ensure server startup, then fetches the server's root content via HTTP request and prints it. The server code is embedded as a string and runs on localhost, serving requests via CGIHTTPRequestHandler. No user input is processed, no data leaks, and no malicious code is evident. The server is local-only, and the code appears intended for testing or demonstration purposes. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code creates and accesses a local HTTP server in a controlled environment. It does not perform malicious actions, exfiltrate data, or connect to external malicious domains. No malicious intent or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
