  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the issues, scores, and conclusions are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malware, standard subprocess management.\n- **Risk & Malware scores:** Both at 0, with a confidence of 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and standard patterns. The low security risk score (0.2) is reasonable given the code's purpose.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid and well justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious activity, standard process control, environment variables are benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, risk at 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical subprocess wrapper, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent. Use of environment variables for behavior toggling is benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as safe.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as previous, no malicious behavior, standard subprocess handling, environment variables are benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard utility, with no suspicious features.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar assessment—no malicious activity, standard subprocess management, potential concern about command injection if 'cmd' is untrusted.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The main security consideration is the potential for command injection if 'cmd' is untrusted, but this is inherent to subprocess execution and not specific to this code. The code itself does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as safe, with a note on input sanitization.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Findings:** Standard subprocess wrapper, no malicious code, no obfuscation, typical output handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical subprocess utility with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard subprocess wrapper.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n- The risk scores are consistently low (0.2), reflecting standard process management code with minimal security concern.\n- Malware scores are all zero, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — standard subprocess management with minimal security risk, mainly related to input sanitization which is outside the scope of this code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and justified. The code is safe, well-structured, and does not contain malicious or obfuscated code. The scores align with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of recommendations:** No changes needed; scores and conclusions are appropriate.",
