  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the provided details, and determine the appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward subprocess wrapper with process management, output handling via temp files or pipes, and error handling. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation evident.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — low, given standard subprocess handling.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence in assessment.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No issues or malicious behaviors are observed. The score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard subprocess management, no signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is consistent and reasonable. No red flags.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical subprocess interface with options for temp files or pipes, no malicious activity or obfuscation. The only notable aspect is environment variable control, which is benign.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is thorough and appropriate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard subprocess wrapper, with process lifecycle management, no signs of malicious behavior. Highlights potential risk if 'cmd' contains untrusted input, but this is a general caution, not specific to malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — standard caution.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation, standard subprocess management.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious behavior, malware, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are zero, reflecting straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly conservative at 0.2, acknowledging standard subprocess risks, especially if inputs are untrusted.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malware or malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — minor, inherent to subprocess management, but no specific threat.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and the scores are appropriate.
