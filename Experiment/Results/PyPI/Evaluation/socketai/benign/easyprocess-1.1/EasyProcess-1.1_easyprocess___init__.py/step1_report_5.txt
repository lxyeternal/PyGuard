{
  "purpose": "Provides a simple Python subprocess interface for running system commands with optional temporary file handling, environment control, and process management.",
  "sources": "Command input (cmd parameter), environment variables (env), environment variable EASYPROCESS_USE_TEMP_FILES, and temporary files created for stdout/stderr.",
  "sinks": "Process spawning (subprocess.Popen), reading from temporary files, and subprocess.communicate output handling.",
  "flows": "Input commands from 'cmd' → subprocess.Popen execution → process output via temporary files or pipes → reading and logging stdout/stderr after process completion.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Use of temporary files for stdout/stderr is standard but could be misused to hide output if combined with malicious code. No obfuscated or unusual language features detected. No network, file system, or data exfiltration code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for managing subprocess execution with options for temporary files, environment variables, and process control. It includes standard error handling, timeout management, and process termination. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network connections, or hidden backdoors. All external interactions are typical for subprocess management. The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for subprocess handling, with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard subprocess utility class with no malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It performs expected process management functions safely and transparently.",
