      "conclusion": "The code is standard for a setup script but carries a moderate security concern due to the use of exec() to load version info. No malware or malicious intent is detected. To improve security, replace exec() with safer methods. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score around 0.3."

The minimal security risk stems from potential misuse of shlex.split with untrusted input, but no actual vulnerabilities are present. Overall, the code is safe, and the reports' assessments are accurate."

The overall malware score is around 0.2-0.3, obfuscation around 0.6, and security risk approximately 0.4. No definitive malicious activity is confirmed, but suspicious features justify cautious scores."

All reports are accurate; the malware score should remain 0, obfuscation score 0, and overall security risk negligible (0). The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports can be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security threat."
