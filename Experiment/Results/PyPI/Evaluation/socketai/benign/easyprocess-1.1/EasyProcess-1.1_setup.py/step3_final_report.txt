  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'easyprocess' Python package, configuring package metadata and versioning.",
  "sources": "Reading 'about.py' via open() and exec() to obtain __version__.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external code through exec(), which could run malicious code if 'about.py' is compromised.",
  "flows": "The code reads 'about.py' and executes its content with exec(), then uses __version__ in setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute an external Python file for version info, which is a potential security concern.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures but relies on executing 'about.py' via exec(), which introduces a risk if the file is malicious or tampered with. No other suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The malware score is 0, consistent with no malicious activity. The security risk score is moderate (~0.3), reflecting the risk inherent in executing external code during setup. The pattern is common but should be replaced with safer alternatives, such as importing 'about.py' as a module or reading version info directly. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.8-0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a setup script but carries a moderate security concern due to the use of exec() to load version info. No malware or malicious intent is detected. To improve security, replace exec() with safer methods. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score around 0.3.",
