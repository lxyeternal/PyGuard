  "purpose": "Set up script for the 'easyprocess' Python package, defining metadata and package information for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'about.py' file to extract version information.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, no network or file system operations with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Execution flow reads version info from a file, then passes static metadata to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to execute 'about.py' content for version info; potential for executing malicious code if 'about.py' is compromised. No other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'os' and 'setuptools', defines package metadata, and executes 'about.py' to extract the version. The use of exec() to run external code for version extraction is a potential security concern because if 'about.py' is malicious or compromised, arbitrary code could be executed. Aside from that, the code is standard setup script with no network activity, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution beyond the exec() call is present.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script is largely standard but relies on executing an external 'about.py' file to get version info, which could be a security risk if the file is compromised. No other malicious behavior detected.",
