  "conclusion": "The code is standard for a setup script but carries a moderate security concern due to the use of exec() to load version info. No malware or malicious intent is detected. To improve security, replace exec() with safer methods. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score around 0.3."
