  "purpose": "Utility functions for splitting command strings and decoding Unicode strings",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'cmd' in split_command, and 's' in unidecode",
  "sinks": "None present; functions do not output or store data insecurely or transmit data externally",
  "flows": "Input 'cmd' flows into shlex.split when cmd is a string; 's' is decoded in unidecode",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; commented-out code is benign and not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for command splitting and Unicode decoding. 'split_command' safely splits command strings using shlex, with an option for POSIX compliance; it does not execute commands or handle untrusted input beyond splitting. 'unidecode' decodes a byte string to UTF-8, ignoring errors, which is a typical operation and not malicious. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard utility operations without any malicious behavior or security risks. There are no indications of malware, data leaks, or malicious data flows.",
