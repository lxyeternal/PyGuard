  "purpose": "Utility functions for splitting command strings into list form and decoding byte strings into Unicode.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to split_command (string or list), input to unidecode (byte string).",
  "sinks": "None; functions only process data without executing or transmitting it.",
  "flows": "Input data is either split into list or decoded; no external or untrusted data is executed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "Commented-out uniencode function; potential issue if unidecode is called with non-bytes input, but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code contains straightforward utility functions using standard libraries (shlex.split, decode). No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration occurs. The use of shlex.split on untrusted input could pose risks if the resulting command is later executed, but in this context, only splitting is performed. The commented-out uniencode suggests incomplete code but no malicious behavior. The functions are safe and benign, with minimal security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from potential misuse of shlex.split with untrusted input, but no actual vulnerabilities are present. Overall, the code is safe, and the reports' assessments are accurate.",
