  "purpose": "Load package metadata from a static JSON string, read README.md for long description, and invoke setuptools.setup() to configure the package.",
  "sources": "The static JSON string containing package metadata, and the reading of README.md file.",
  "sinks": "The call to setuptools.setup() which uses the parsed metadata and description.",
  "flows": "JSON string is parsed into kwargs, README.md content is assigned to 'long_description', then setup() is called with kwargs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; static data and standard setup operations. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code loads package metadata from a hardcoded JSON string, reads a README.md file for description, and calls setuptools.setup() with this data. All operations are standard for Python package setup scripts. No suspicious code, malicious payloads, or obfuscation are present. The JSON data is static and human-readable, and the file reading is safe. The overall structure is straightforward and typical for such scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All evidence points to a safe and transparent configuration process.",
