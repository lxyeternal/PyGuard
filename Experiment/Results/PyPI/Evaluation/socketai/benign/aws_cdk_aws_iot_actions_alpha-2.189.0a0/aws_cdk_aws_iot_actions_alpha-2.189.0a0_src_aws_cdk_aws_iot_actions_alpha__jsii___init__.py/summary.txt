  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard AWS CDK package initialization snippet with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main potential risk is associated with dynamic assembly loading, which is typical in JSII-based packages but should be sourced from trusted origins. Overall, the security posture is very low risk."
