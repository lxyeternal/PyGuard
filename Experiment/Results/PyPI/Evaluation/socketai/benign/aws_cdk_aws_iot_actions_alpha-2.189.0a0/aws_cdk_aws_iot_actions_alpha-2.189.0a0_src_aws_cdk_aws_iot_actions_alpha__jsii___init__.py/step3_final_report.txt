  "purpose": "Module setup for AWS CDK package, extending module paths, managing version-dependent type checking, loading JSII assembly, and publishing.",
  "sources": "Path extension (__path__), version retrieval (_metadata_package_version), assembly load (jsii.JSIIAssembly.load), import statements.",
  "sinks": "Assembly load via jsii, publication call.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (path, version info) lead to assembly loading and publication functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard package initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks for an AWS CDK construct library. It extends module paths, retrieves package version info, conditionally manages type checking based on version, loads a JSII assembly, and publishes the package. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity are present. The assembly load step is standard but could be a supply chain risk if the source is compromised, though no evidence suggests malicious intent. The code is straightforward and aligns with common practices in CDK packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard AWS CDK package initialization snippet with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main potential risk is associated with dynamic assembly loading, which is typical in JSII-based packages but should be sourced from trusted origins. Overall, the security posture is very low risk.",
