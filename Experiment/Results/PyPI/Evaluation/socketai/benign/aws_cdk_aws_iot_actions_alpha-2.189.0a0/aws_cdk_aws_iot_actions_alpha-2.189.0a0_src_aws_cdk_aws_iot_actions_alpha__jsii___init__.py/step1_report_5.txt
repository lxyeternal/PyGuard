{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module paths, import various libraries, and configure type checking and jsii assembly loading for AWS CDK constructs related to IoT actions.",
  "sources": "Reads environment data via importlib.metadata for package version, module path extensions (__path__, __name__), and external library imports (jsii, publication).",
  "sinks": "Calls to jsii.JSIIAssembly.load() potentially loads remote or local assembly files; publication.publish() might publish module data.",
  "flows": "Package version retrieved from environment → jsii.JSIIAssembly.load() loads assembly files → publication.publish() publishes data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of jsii to load assembly files is standard for CDK libraries. No obfuscated or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly manages module path extension, imports dependencies, configures type checking based on package versions, and loads a jsii assembly for AWS CDK constructs. The use of jsii and publication appears typical for CDK packages. No unusual code or behavior, no network calls, no data exfiltration mechanisms, and no suspicious operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for a Python CDK module involving jsii assembly loading and type checking configuration. No signs of malicious activity or security risks are identified.",
