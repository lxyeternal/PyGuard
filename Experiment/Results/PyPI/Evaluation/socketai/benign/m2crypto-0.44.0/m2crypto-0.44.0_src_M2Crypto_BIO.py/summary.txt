  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard wrapper around OpenSSL BIO functionalities with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. The scoring in the reports accurately reflects its benign nature. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the security risk at 0.2, indicating low but potential misuse if misconfigured. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for cryptographic operations."
