  "purpose": "The code provides a Python wrapper interface for OpenSSL BIO functionalities, including memory buffers, file handling, cipher streams, SSL BIOs, and buffer chaining, facilitating cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "bio_read, bio_gets, bio_new, bio_new_pyfd, bio_new_pyfile, open, bio_ctrl_pending, bio_set_cipher, bio_do_handshake, bio_set_ssl, bio_push, bio_pop, bio_free, bio_write, bio_flush, bio_reset, bio_should_retry, bio_should_read, bio_should_write, bio_tell, bio_seek",
  "sinks": "bio_write, bio_set_cipher, bio_set_ssl, bio_push, bio_pop, bio_free, bio_flush, bio_reset, bio_do_handshake",
  "flows": "Sources such as bio_read, bio_gets, open/read from files or memory -> functions like bio_write, bio_set_cipher, bio_set_ssl, bio_push, bio_do_handshake -> sinks like bio_write, bio_set_cipher, bio_set_ssl",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code is a straightforward wrapper around cryptographic API calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured Python wrapper for OpenSSL BIO APIs, providing classes for memory buffers, file I/O, cipher streams, SSL BIOs, and buffer chaining. It uses known OpenSSL functions via the m2 library without any suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code. The functions handle data securely, and no network activity or data exfiltration is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and structure. The code's purpose is to facilitate cryptographic buffer and SSL operations, and it does not perform any malicious actions or contain vulnerabilities that would justify higher scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard wrapper around OpenSSL BIO functionalities with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. The scoring in the reports accurately reflects its benign nature. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the security risk at 0.2, indicating low but potential misuse if misconfigured. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for cryptographic operations.",
