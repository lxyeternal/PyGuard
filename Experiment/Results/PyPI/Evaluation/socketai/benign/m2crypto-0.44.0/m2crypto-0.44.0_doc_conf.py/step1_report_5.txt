  "purpose": "Configuration file for generating documentation with Sphinx for the M2Crypto project.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters, project metadata, and file paths; no user input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Writes configuration settings, file paths, and project info; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are set at the beginning; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with no external input handling, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution. It only sets static parameters for documentation generation, including paths, extensions, themes, and project info. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or injection points. The script is well-structured, typical for a documentation build file, and contains no anomalies or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script for documentation purposes with no malicious intent or security risks.",
