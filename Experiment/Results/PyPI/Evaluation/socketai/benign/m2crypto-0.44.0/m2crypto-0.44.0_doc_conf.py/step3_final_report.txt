{
  "purpose": "This code is a configuration file for setting up Sphinx documentation for the M2Crypto project. It defines paths, extensions, themes, and output options for building documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads static configuration parameters, imports standard modules (sys, os), and sets various variables related to documentation build settings.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, network connections, or data leaks; the code does not process external data or execute dynamic code.",
  "flows": "The code's flow is limited to static assignment of configuration variables without any external data or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, modifies sys.path to include the parent directory, and sets configuration options for Sphinx documentation. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources. The code is purely static configuration with clear structure and purpose. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned scores reflect this benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration script for Sphinx documentation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. All scores (malware, obfuscated, risk) are appropriately set to 0, consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
