The primary concern is reliance on environment variables, which is standard but warrants secure handling. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical build environment considerations."

The static callback, fixed certificate data, and use of deprecated 'sha1' are minor security weaknesses but do not constitute malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."

The scoring in the reports accurately reflects its benign nature. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the security risk at 0.2, indicating low but potential misuse if misconfigured. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for cryptographic operations."

The primary concern is the use of an insecure cipher (RC4), which warrants a low security risk score but does not elevate malware or obfuscation scores. The assessments and scores across reports are accurate and consistent."
