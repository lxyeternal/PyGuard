  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the provided scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a wrapper around OpenSSL's EC functionalities via the m2 module.\n- It handles key generation, loading, saving, signing, verification, and key exchange.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code is present.\n- The comments and structure suggest standard cryptographic practices.\n- The reports consistently assign very low security risk, malware, and obfuscated scores, with high confidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Standard wrapper for EC cryptography.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Files, strings, and cryptographic operations.\n- **Anomalies:** None suspicious; awareness of unsupported curves.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns; standard cryptographic practices.\n- **Conclusion:** No malware or malicious behavior; very low risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Interface for ECC operations, including key management.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Files, callbacks, serialization.\n- **Anomalies:** Reliance on user-supplied callbacks; typical.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; standard cryptography.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; scores are appropriate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Wrapper for EC key operations, including signing and key management.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Files, memory buffers, DER/PEM formats.\n- **Anomalies:** None; standard practices.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; legitimate cryptographic functions.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of sabotage or malware.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** ECC interface for key management, signing, verification.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Files, memory buffers, key derivation.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis:** Standard cryptographic wrapper; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** ECC wrapper, including key serialization and cryptographic operations.\n- **Sources/Sinks:** Files, key exchange, signing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; standard functions.\n- **Analysis:** No covert or malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of sabotage.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code does not contain any malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is consistent; no obfuscation or hidden code.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**  \n- Given the detailed analysis, the scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's intent and structure.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 – 0.2 (very low, standard cryptographic wrapper)\n\nThe scores provided in the reports are justified and should be maintained as they accurately reflect the code's security posture.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured cryptographic wrapper with no malicious or suspicious features.",
