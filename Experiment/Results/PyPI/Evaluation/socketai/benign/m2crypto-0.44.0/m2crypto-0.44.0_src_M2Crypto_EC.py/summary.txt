  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign cryptographic utility for ECC operations. There is no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or backdoors. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."
