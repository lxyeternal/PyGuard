  "purpose": "A Python wrapper class for the OpenSSL RC4 cipher, providing methods to set keys, encrypt/decrypt data, and manage resources.",
  "sources": "Input key provided during initialization or via set_key method; data passed to update method.",
  "sinks": "Output of rc4_update (encrypted/decrypted data); resource cleanup in __del__.",
  "flows": "Key input flows into rc4_set_key; data flows from update to output; resource cleanup flows into rc4_free.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, transparent wrapper around the M2Crypto RC4 functions. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or contain obfuscation. The use of RC4, a deprecated cipher, is a security concern but not malicious. Resource management is handled properly. No suspicious logic or anomalies are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature and the cryptographic weakness, but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward cryptographic wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The primary concern is the use of an insecure cipher (RC4), which warrants a low security risk score but does not elevate malware or obfuscation scores. The assessments and scores across reports are accurate and consistent.",
