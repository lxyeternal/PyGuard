  "purpose": "Wrapper for OpenSSL RC4 stream cipher API to enable encryption/decryption operations.",
  "sources": "Input keys provided during initialization or via set_key method.",
  "sinks": "rc4_set_key and rc4_update functions interact with cipher state; no external output sinks directly linked to untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Initialization with key -> set_key method -> update method for processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code follows standard pattern for RC4 cipher wrapper. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an object-oriented wrapper around the M2Crypto RC4 functions. It allows setting a key, updating (encrypting/decrypting) data, and freeing resources appropriately. The functions used are standard cryptographic library calls, with no suspicious logic or code flow. The final method returns an empty string, which is benign. No indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of an RC4 cipher wrapper without malicious intent. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code, nor does it perform any suspicious activities. It is safe in the context of supply chain security.",
