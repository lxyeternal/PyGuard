  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward cryptographic wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The primary concern is the use of an insecure cipher (RC4), which warrants a low security risk score but does not elevate malware or obfuscation scores. The assessments and scores across reports are accurate and consistent."
