  "conclusion": "The script is a benign PKI demo with no malicious intent or activity. The static callback, fixed certificate data, and use of deprecated 'sha1' are minor security weaknesses but do not constitute malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."
