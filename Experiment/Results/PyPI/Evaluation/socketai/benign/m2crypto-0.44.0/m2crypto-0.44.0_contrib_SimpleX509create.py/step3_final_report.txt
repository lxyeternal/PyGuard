{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates RSA key generation, CSR creation, and self-signed certificate issuance for PKI purposes, primarily as a demo or testing utility.",
  "sources": "Static certificate fields, internal cryptographic functions, fixed callback returning 'p'.",
  "sinks": "Saves private key to disk ('KeyPair.pem'), outputs certificate details via print.",
  "flows": "Sequential cryptographic operations with internal data; no external input or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Callback function returns a static string 'p'; fixed certificate subject and issuer data; deprecated ASN1.set_time() with fixed integer; use of insecure 'sha1' for signing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic operations typical of a demo setup. No external data, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The static callback and fixed certificate data are benign, though unusual. The use of 'sha1' is a cryptographic weakness but not malicious. No obfuscation or backdoors are detected. Overall, the code is straightforward and intended for demonstration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign PKI demo with no malicious intent or activity. The static callback, fixed certificate data, and use of deprecated 'sha1' are minor security weaknesses but do not constitute malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
