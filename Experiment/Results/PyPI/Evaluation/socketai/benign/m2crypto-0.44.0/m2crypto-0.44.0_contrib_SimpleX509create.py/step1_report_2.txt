{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates the generation of a self-signed X.509 certificate and a corresponding private key, intended as a PKI demo.",
  "sources": "Reads input from fixed strings for subject and issuer details; uses internal cryptographic library functions; reads key parameters from class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Stores private keys on disk ('KeyPair.pem'); signs certificates with private key; prints certificate text; no network or external data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Creates key -> saves key to disk -> builds CSR and certificate -> signs CSR with private key -> outputs certificate text.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a fixed callback that returns a static character 'p'; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; uses deprecated or non-standard ASN1 time setting method; no suspicious network activity or backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The script generates RSA key pairs, creates a certificate signing request, and signs a self-signed certificate with fixed subject and issuer data. It saves the private key to a file, and outputs the certificate details. The cryptographic operations appear standard, with no external or suspicious inputs or outputs. The callback method returns a static value, but this does not constitute malicious behavior. No code injection, data exfiltration, or network communication observed. Use of hardcoded subject/issuer info and fixed callback is typical for demo code, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard demonstration of certificate generation with no evidence of malicious intent or security risk. It performs expected cryptographic functions without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
