  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Provides SSL/TLS support, including proxy support, with M2Crypto. No suspicious code, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation. Uses standard practices, with a note on deprecated functions but nothing malicious.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the lack of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — reasonable, as the code manages SSL and proxy securely, but outdated functions and potential resource leaks are noted.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code is standard, with no evident malicious activity. The low malware and risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes standard SSL and proxy handling, no malicious code, uses base64 encoding for proxy auth, which is standard.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — appropriate, considering potential misconfigurations but no active threats.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No suspicious behaviors or malicious payloads. The use of base64 encoding is standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Details SSL proxy classes, proxy auth via base64, no malicious code, deprecated functions used but not malicious.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — acceptable, considering outdated functions but no active security issues.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code. No evidence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on SSL context handling, use of SSL.Connection, proxy support, mentions deprecated functions, no malicious code.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — reasonable, with caution due to deprecated functions and lack of validation.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, SSL and proxy support, no hardcoded credentials, uses standard libraries, notes deprecated functions but no malicious intent.\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — justified, given outdated practices but no active vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion matches the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Code confirmation:** All reports agree that the code implements SSL/TLS and proxy support correctly, with no malicious code or backdoors.\n\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Use of deprecated functions like `base64.encodestring()` is noted but not malicious. No validation of SSL contexts or credentials is performed, which could be a concern but not malicious.\n\n- **Scores:** All malware scores are 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity. Risk scores are low (0.2), justified by potential misconfigurations and outdated practices but no active threats.\n\n- **Potential Malicious Behavior:** None detected. Proxy credentials are encoded via standard base64, which is normal, not malicious.\n\n- **Assumptions:** No claims are based on unwarranted assumptions; all analyses are cautious and based on code inspection.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity or payloads detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — minor concerns about deprecated functions and lack of validation, but no active vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of SSL and proxy support for HTTP/HTTPS connections using M2Crypto. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent is present. The low risk score is appropriate, with some caution advised regarding outdated practices.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like further analysis or specific focus on any part.",
