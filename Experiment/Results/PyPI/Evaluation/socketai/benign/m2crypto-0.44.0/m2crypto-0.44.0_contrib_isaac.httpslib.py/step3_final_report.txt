{
  "purpose": "The code provides SSL support for Python 2.x's httplib, including classes for HTTPS connections, proxy support, and SSL tunneling via proxies, utilizing the M2Crypto library.",
  "sources": "Reads hostnames, ports, SSL context parameters, proxy credentials, and request details from function parameters and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Establishes SSL connections, sends HTTP requests with headers (including proxy authorization), and manages socket connections.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (host, port, SSL context, proxy credentials) flow into connection setup and request headers; proxy authentication credentials flow into headers; SSL contexts are used during connection establishment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'base64.encodestring()' for encoding proxy credentials; lack of validation for SSL context parameters; potential resource leaks due to unclosed connections; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard SSL and proxy connection classes with support for SSL contexts and proxy authentication. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of deprecated functions is noted but not malicious. The code manages SSL connections and proxy authentication correctly, with appropriate class structures. No obfuscation is detected. The main concerns are outdated practices and lack of validation, which do not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of SSL and proxy support for Python 2.x's httplib, with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The low malware score (0) and risk score (0.2) are justified, reflecting minor outdated practices but no active vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
