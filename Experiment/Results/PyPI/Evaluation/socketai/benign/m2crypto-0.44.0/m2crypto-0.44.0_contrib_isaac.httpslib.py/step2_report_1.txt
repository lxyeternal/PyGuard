  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and evaluate the scoring and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's function—SSL support, proxy support, SSL context, credentials.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Appropriately identifies data flows, including headers and SSL contexts.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials or malicious code; use of `base64.encodestring()` is outdated but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The review correctly states that the code is standard, with no malicious behavior or backdoors. The high confidence (0.9) and malware score (0) seem appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is reasonable, given the potential for misconfiguration but no active vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, covering SSL and proxy support.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes the encoding of proxy credentials with base64 and connection setup.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; use of base64 encoding is standard, though deprecated.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the code is legitimate, with no malicious intent. The confidence and malware scores are appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, consistent assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functionality, with detailed class descriptions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes encoding proxy credentials with base64 and SSL tunnel setup.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions deprecated `encodestring()`, no malicious code, comments about long-lived connections are benign.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately states the code is standard SSL proxy support, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues, justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, focusing on SSL context and proxy handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes SSL connection setup, base64 encoding, and potential misconfigurations.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights use of deprecated functions and lack of validation, which could be security concerns but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately cautious; no malicious code detected. The low malware score and risk are justified.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2, seem reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No malicious issues, cautious but justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, describing SSL, proxy, and context management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes data flow, including headers and SSL setup.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions outdated `encodestring()` but no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.2 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard implementation of SSL and proxy support, with no malicious payloads or backdoors.\n- Use of deprecated functions (`encodestring()`) is noted but not malicious.\n- No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behaviors, or malicious activities are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware 0, risk 0.2) are consistent with the code's content and the reports' reasoning.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 reflects minor concerns about misconfiguration or outdated practices, not active vulnerabilities.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to deprecated functions and lack of input validation but no active exploits)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears safe for use, with no malicious intent or supply chain risks identified.",
