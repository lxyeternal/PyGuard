  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to determine if the issues are valid, consistent, and whether any scores need adjustment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes SSL support, proxy, and credentials handling.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data leakage or mishandling observed.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, no malicious code, use of deprecated functions (like encodestring) is noted but not malicious. SSL context management appears straightforward.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that the code is standard, safe, and free of malicious behavior is consistent with the code review.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, justified).  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing SSL, proxy support, and proper handling.  \n- No suspicious or malicious activity detected.  \n- Use of base64 encoding for proxy headers is standard, and no hardcoded credentials are present.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- Focuses on SSL proxy classes, including SSL tunneling and proxy authentication.  \n- Mentions deprecated functions like 'encodestring' but clarifies that it's not malicious.  \n- No evidence of malicious activity or backdoors.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n\n**Verdict:** Accurate reflection of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- Highlights SSL context handling, proxy support, and use of M2Crypto.  \n- Notes outdated practices like 'encodestring' but no malicious intent.  \n- Points out potential misconfigurations but not malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- Summarizes the code's SSL and proxy features, with similar findings.  \n- No suspicious code or hardcoded credentials.  \n- Uses standard methods, with some outdated functions but no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No, all reports agree the code is standard, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** No significant errors. All reports correctly identify the use of deprecated functions but do not interpret this as malicious.  \n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and low security risk (0.2), which is consistent with the code review.  \n- **Risk justification:** The low risk score is justified given the absence of malicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets. The only concern is outdated functions, which are not malicious but could pose security or maintenance issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, due to outdated practices and potential misconfigurations but no active threat)\n\n**My personal estimate aligns with the reports:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears safe, well-structured, and free of malicious or obfuscated content. The low risk score is appropriate, with no need for adjustments.",
