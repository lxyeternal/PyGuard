  "purpose": "A cryptographic wrapper around OpenSSL's Diffie-Hellman API, providing functions for parameter generation, loading, setting, and key computation.",
  "sources": "File inputs via BIO.openfile, data passed to functions like load_params_bio, load_params, set_params, and pubkey inputs in compute_key.",
  "sinks": "Returns cryptographic parameters, keys, or prints parameters; no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data from files or byte strings flows into cryptographic functions; outputs are cryptographic parameters or keys, with no external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-implemented wrapper around OpenSSL's DH API, performing input validation and resource management. It handles cryptographic parameters and keys securely, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The data flows are typical for such libraries, involving reading from files or streams and returning cryptographic data. No network activity or malicious logic is present. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate. The risk score (0.2) reflects minimal concern, primarily related to the handling of untrusted input files, which is standard in cryptographic contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard cryptographic wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements. Its low risk score is justified, assuming proper handling of untrusted inputs. No modifications are necessary.",
