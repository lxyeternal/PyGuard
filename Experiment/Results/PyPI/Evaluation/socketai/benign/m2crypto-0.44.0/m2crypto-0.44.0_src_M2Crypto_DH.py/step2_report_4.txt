  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- A straightforward Python wrapper around OpenSSL's DH API via the m2 module.\n- Functions for generating, loading, setting parameters, and computing keys.\n- Proper input validation and resource management.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.\n- Data flows involve reading cryptographic parameters from files or byte strings, with outputs being cryptographic keys or parameters.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Interface to OpenSSL DH, with parameter generation/loading.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; standard cryptographic wrapper.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Correctly identified as a cryptographic utility with low risk; no malware detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Python wrapper for OpenSSL DH API.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Similar to Report 1, it is a standard wrapper with low risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Wrapper for OpenSSL DH, managing parameters and keys.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; standard cryptographic functions.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the previous assessments; low risk, no malware.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Wrapper for OpenSSL DH, with resource management.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; proper validation and resource handling.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Correctly identifies the code as a standard cryptographic wrapper.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous, wrapping OpenSSL DH functions.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with prior assessments; low risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting low but not zero risk due to external data inputs (files, untrusted sources). The code itself is not risky but relies on external inputs, which could be misused if the environment is compromised.\n\n### **Additional notes:**\n- The code is a clean, standard wrapper around cryptographic functions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The only potential concern is misuse of untrusted inputs, but that is typical for cryptographic libraries and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n**Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Justification:** The code is a straightforward, well-implemented cryptographic wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated content. The low risk score accounts for potential misuse if external inputs are untrusted, but this is a standard consideration in cryptographic libraries.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
