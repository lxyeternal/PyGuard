  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard cryptographic utility wrapping OpenSSL RNG functions. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are detected. The deprecation warning in randfname is appropriate and does not indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."
