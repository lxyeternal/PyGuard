  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build setup for the M2Crypto extension, with no signs of malicious behavior. The primary concern is reliance on environment variables, which is standard but warrants secure handling. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical build environment considerations."
