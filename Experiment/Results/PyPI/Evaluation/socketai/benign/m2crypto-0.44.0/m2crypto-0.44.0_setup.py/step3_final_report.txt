  "purpose": "Build setup script for the M2Crypto Python extension, configuring dependencies, platform-specific options, and DLL management.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (OPENSSL_PATH, CPP, CFLAGS, CC), subprocess calls for SDK and compiler detection, header files, and DLL copying based on environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Loading libraries via ctypes, copying DLLs, executing subprocess commands for version detection and compilation, reading header files.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence subprocess commands and DLL paths; subprocess outputs inform build options; DLL copying depends on environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for DLL paths and compiler commands, which could be manipulated in a malicious environment, but this is typical for build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build configuration tasks, including environment detection, version checks, platform-specific adjustments, and DLL management. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Reliance on environment variables introduces potential supply chain risks if environment is compromised, but this is common in build scripts. No network activity or data exfiltration is observed. The subprocess calls and DLL copying are typical for such build processes. Overall, the script is benign with minimal inherent security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build setup for the M2Crypto extension, with no signs of malicious behavior. The primary concern is reliance on environment variables, which is standard but warrants secure handling. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting typical build environment considerations.",
