  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module performing typical data processing or network communication tasks, with no obfuscation or suspicious imports observed.",
  "sources": "Standard input sources such as function parameters, environment variables, or file reads; no suspicious data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Standard output, network transmission, or file writes; no untrusted data flows leading to security issues observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to sinks without suspicious transformations or untrusted data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, eval/exec, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with typical data handling and communication patterns. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. Confidence in benign assessment is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities identified. The scores reflect a low threat level consistent with the analysis.",
