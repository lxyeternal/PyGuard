  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific operation, likely related to data processing or network communication, based on the imported modules and functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from user inputs, environment variables, and possibly external files or network responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or execution functions that could process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as inputs or environment variables into processing functions, and then possibly to sinks such as network transmissions or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or hidden backdoors are evident. No unusual dynamic execution or obfuscated constructs are detected. The code structure appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common modules, handles input and output operations, and performs typical processing routines. There are no signs of malicious network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoor functionalities. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe eval statements are observed. The overall structure suggests legitimate functionality without suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code appears benign with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard operations typical of legitimate applications. The confidence level is high due to the straightforward nature of the code and lack of suspicious signals.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
