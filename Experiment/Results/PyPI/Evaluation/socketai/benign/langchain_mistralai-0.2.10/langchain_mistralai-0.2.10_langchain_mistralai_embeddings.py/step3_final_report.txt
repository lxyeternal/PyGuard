  "purpose": "Client for MistralAI's embedding API, handling batching, tokenization, environment secrets, and both sync and async requests.",
  "sources": "Environment variable for API key, input texts, tokenizer for batching.",
  "sinks": "API responses containing embedding data.",
  "flows": "Input texts -> tokenization -> batching -> API requests -> response parsing -> embeddings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fallback DummyTokenizer is benign and explicitly documented.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured API client with secure secret management via environment variables, proper batching, retry logic, and error handling. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious logic is present. The fallback DummyTokenizer is a benign measure for robustness. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. The data flow is straightforward, and the code adheres to best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation of an API client for MistralAI embeddings. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The low risk score (~0.1-0.2) accurately reflects operational considerations without indicating security threats.",
