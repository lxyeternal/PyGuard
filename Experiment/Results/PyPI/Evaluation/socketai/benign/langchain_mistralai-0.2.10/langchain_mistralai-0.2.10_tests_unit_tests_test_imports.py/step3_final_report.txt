  "purpose": "Verify that the __all__ attribute in the langchain_mistralai module contains the expected symbols, ensuring API consistency.",
  "sources": "Import statement from langchain_mistralai and the __all__ attribute within that module.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not handle untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code imports __all__, then compares it to an expected list, asserting equality.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward test with no obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple assertion to verify the contents of __all__, with no dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. It is a standard API integrity check. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The code's purpose is transparent, and no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export verification with no security concerns or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
