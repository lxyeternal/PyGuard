  "purpose": "The code is a simple test to verify that the __all__ list from the langchain_mistralai module contains the expected public API components.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __all__ list from the langchain_mistralai module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "The source (__all__) is compared against the expected list (EXPECTED_ALL), with no data flow beyond this comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or hidden behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and performs a simple assertion.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the __all__ list from the langchain_mistralai module, defines an expected list of public API components, and asserts that the actual list matches the expected one. The code is a standard test pattern used in module validation. There are no dynamic imports, user inputs, or data leaks. No suspicious or malicious code behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple unit test verifying the contents of the __all__ list. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign validation script.",
