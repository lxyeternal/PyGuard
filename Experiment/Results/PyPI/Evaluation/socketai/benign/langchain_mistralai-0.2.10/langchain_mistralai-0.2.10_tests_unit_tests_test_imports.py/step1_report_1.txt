  "purpose": "The code appears to verify that the __all__ variable in the langchain_mistralai module contains expected public symbols.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __all__ variable from the langchain_mistralai module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output mechanisms that could leak data or execute untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "The source (__all__ from langchain_mistralai) is compared against an expected list to ensure integrity.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs a straightforward import and assertion without any obfuscated or suspicious logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the __all__ attribute from a module named langchain_mistralai. It defines an expected list of symbols and asserts that the actual __all__ matches this list after sorting. This is a simple integrity check or test to ensure the module's public API hasn't been unintentionally changed. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data flows, or anomalies. The code is minimal, clean, and typical for a test or validation script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless integrity check verifying the contents of __all__ in a module. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
