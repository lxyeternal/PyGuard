  "purpose": "Test setup for MistralAIEmbeddings with hardcoded API keys and environment variable assignment.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'MISTRAL_API_KEY' set to 'foo'; API keys passed as 'test' in constructor.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'MISTRAL_API_KEY' set -> API keys used in object instantiation -> assertions verify values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded API keys ('foo', 'test') in test code; no obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, setting environment variables and creating instances with hardcoded secrets. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are detected. The security concern is the use of hardcoded API keys, which is typical in test environments but insecure for production. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The security risk score is 0.2, indicating minor concern due to insecure secret handling, which is acceptable in testing but should be addressed before deployment. The confidence score is high (around 0.9) given the clarity and simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious activity or obfuscation. The only issue is the use of hardcoded secrets, which is typical in test code but should be secured in production. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
