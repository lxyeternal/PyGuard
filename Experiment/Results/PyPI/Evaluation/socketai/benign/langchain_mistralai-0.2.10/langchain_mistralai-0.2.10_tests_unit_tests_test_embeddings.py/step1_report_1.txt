{
  "purpose": "The code initializes environment variables and creates instances of MistralAIEmbeddings with provided API keys for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment variable 'MISTRAL_API_KEY' and parameters 'mistral_api_key' and 'api_key' in the MistralAIEmbeddings constructor.",
  "sinks": "The API keys are stored in memory and accessed via the SecretStr's get_secret_value method; no external sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'MISTRAL_API_KEY' is set at the start. During object instantiation, the provided API keys ('test') are assigned to model instances and verified via assertions.",
  "anomalies": "The code hardcodes API keys ('foo' and 'test') directly into the script, which could be considered insecure if sensitive data were real. No malicious behavior or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script sets an environment variable for an API key, then creates instances of a class with specified model names and API keys, verifying that these are correctly assigned. Usage of 'cast' with SecretStr indicates intended handling of secret data. No network activity, file access, or malicious code is present. Hardcoded API keys are a security concern but not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward test setup for the MistralAIEmbeddings class, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The only concern is hardcoded API keys, which pose security risks if used with real secrets. No malicious or sabotage activities are detected.",
