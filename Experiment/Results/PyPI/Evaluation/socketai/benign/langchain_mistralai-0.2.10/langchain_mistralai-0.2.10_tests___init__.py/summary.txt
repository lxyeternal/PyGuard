  "malware_score": 0.75,
  "security_risk": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 1 presents high suspicion of malicious activity, justified by its indicators. Reports 2 and 3 are benign with no code. Report 4's obfuscation warrants caution but no confirmed malicious behavior, leading to a slightly lower malware score. The overall assessment supports the current scoring, emphasizing the need for further investigation of Report 1. Minor score adjustments for Report 4's malware score from 0.2 to 0.1 improve consistency without altering the overall risk profile."
