  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform data processing or utility functions, but the exact intent cannot be fully determined without specific context or comments.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, environment variables, and potentially user input via stdin or API calls. It also imports external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file system writes, subprocess calls, or data transmission points where untrusted data could leak or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables) through processing functions, possibly into network sockets, files, or external commands.",
  "anomalies": "No clear anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears straightforward, with no suspicious dynamic execution or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with standard imports and configuration. It reads data from environment variables and function inputs. There are no signs of code obfuscation or unusual constructs. The code interacts with external modules responsibly, with no evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration or harmful commands. There are no suspicious network connections, cryptomining activity, or backdoors detected. The overall structure suggests a utility script with normal behavior, but without full context, certain data flows could potentially be misused if misconfigured.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script. However, without additional context or specific input data, the confidence remains high but not absolute.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
