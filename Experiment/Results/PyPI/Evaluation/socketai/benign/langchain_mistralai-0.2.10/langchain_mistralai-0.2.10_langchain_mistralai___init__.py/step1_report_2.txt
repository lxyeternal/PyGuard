  "purpose": "Define and expose specific classes from the langchain_mistralai package for external use",
  "sources": "Import statements from langchain_mistralai.chat_models and langchain_mistralai.embeddings",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external effects present",
  "flows": "Import statements to module initialization; no data flows or processing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from external libraries and sets __all__ for exports. There is no data processing, user input handling, or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code appears to be a standard module declaration intended for packaging or API exposure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import and export declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply exposes classes from a package for external use.",
