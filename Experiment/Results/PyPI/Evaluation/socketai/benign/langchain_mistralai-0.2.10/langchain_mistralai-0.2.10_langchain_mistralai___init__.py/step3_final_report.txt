{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes from an external package and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'langchain_mistralai' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network operations, or dynamic execution present.",
  "flows": "Import statements serve as sources; no data flows or untrusted data to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports classes and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. Multiple reviews confirm the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present, and the code aligns with standard module design patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal module for re-exporting classes with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
