{
  "purpose": "Define and export specific classes from the langchain_mistralai package modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'langchain_mistralai.chat_models' and 'langchain_mistralai.embeddings'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; code only imports modules and sets __all__.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code simply declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from external modules and exposes them via the __all__ variable. No input handling, data processing, or network operations are present. The modules imported seem to relate to AI models and embeddings, typical for ML packages. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code appears to be a standard module export pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module that exports specific classes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a simple interface layer without any dangerous operations.",
