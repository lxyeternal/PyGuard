  "purpose": "Export specific classes from langchain_mistralai package modules for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from langchain_mistralai.chat_models and langchain_mistralai.embeddings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, output, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific classes from third-party modules and defines an __all__ list for module exports. There are no input handling, data processing, or network operations. The code appears to be a simple module for re-exporting classes, with no suspicious or malicious behavior. No embedded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code identified. The minimal structure indicates a straightforward module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module re-export with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data, connect externally, or perform any malicious actions.",
