{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports specific classes from the langchain_mistralai package for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the langchain_mistralai package",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or output involved",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flows from input to output in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs; simple import/export statements",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports two classes from a third-party package and defines __all__ for exports. No data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. The import statements are straightforward and do not access untrusted sources or handle sensitive data. There is no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign module that imports specific classes from an external package and declares them for export. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
