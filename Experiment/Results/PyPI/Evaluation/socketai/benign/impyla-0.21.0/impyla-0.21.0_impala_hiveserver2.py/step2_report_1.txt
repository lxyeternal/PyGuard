  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, focusing on the presence of malicious indicators, logical consistency, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a well-structured client for HiveServer2 and Impala, with no signs of malicious behavior. It manages sessions, queries, and results securely. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate, no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — appropriate, code appears clear and standard.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence in the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard Python client for HiveServer2/Impala, with no signs of malicious activity. It handles connections, retries, and queries properly. No obfuscation or backdoors.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — still low, reflecting typical client library risks, but no malicious indicators.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are consistent. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports; standard client code with network communication, session, and query management. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — low, aligns with benign assessment.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard client implementation with no suspicious activity. Handles network, sessions, and queries securely.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — consistent.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a typical client library for HiveServer2/Impala, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. It manages connections and queries securely.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — low, typical for such libraries.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — very high.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's purpose and structure. No malicious activity or payloads are detected.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports assign obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the code clarity and lack of obfuscation patterns.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly above zero, but very low, reflecting the inherent risks of networked database clients but no malicious intent.\n\n- **Confidence:** High confidence levels (0.9–0.95) across reports, justified given the thoroughness and clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a legitimate, open-source client library for HiveServer2 and Impala, with standard patterns, no obfuscation, and no malicious behaviors.\n\n- The assigned scores are reasonable and consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, well-structured code)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal inherent risk, typical for networked database clients)\n\nThese scores reflect a high-confidence assessment that the dependency is safe and benign.",
