{
  "purpose": "The code implements a client interface for HiveServer2 and Impala, managing sessions, executing queries, and fetching results securely. It handles network communication, retries, and session management in a standard manner.",
  "sources": "User inputs, network responses from RPC calls, session initiation, query execution, and result fetching.",
  "sinks": "RPC calls to the server, responses processed into data structures, and network communication channels.",
  "flows": "User or system input triggers session creation or query execution; data flows through RPC requests; server responses are received and processed into Python objects or data batches.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code follows standard practices without unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured client library for HiveServer2 and Impala, managing sessions, executing SQL statements, and processing results. It employs standard network communication patterns, error handling, and resource management. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The assigned malware score of 0 aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The obfuscated score of 0 is justified by the code clarity. The low risk score (~0.1) reflects inherent network communication risks but no specific vulnerabilities or malicious indicators. Confidence scores are high (around 0.9), given the thoroughness of the code review and the absence of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source client library for HiveServer2 and Impala, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or sabotage. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
