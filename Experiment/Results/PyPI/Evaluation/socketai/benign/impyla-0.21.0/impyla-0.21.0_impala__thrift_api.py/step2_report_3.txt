  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report, verify the presence of issues, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The code implements a custom HTTP transport with support for multiple auth methods, cookie handling, SSL, proxies, and headers. Sources include URL parsing, environment variables, and server responses. Sinks are network requests, headers, and cookies. Flows involve data from environment/user input into headers, cookies, and request retries.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic detected. The code operates as expected for a network transport module.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, standard implementation. No malware or security issues.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on SSL, cookies, proxy, and multiple auth methods. Sources include environment, user, network responses. Sinks are network requests, headers, cookies.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior or backdoors. Standard cookie and SSL management. No suspicious code.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, secure, standard code.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar implementation with support for multiple auth mechanisms. Sources include environment variables, user input, network responses. Sinks are headers, sockets, requests.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Notably, default passwords like `'password'` are used for LDAP/PLAIN. While this is a security concern, it is common in placeholder or example code, not malicious. No obfuscated or malicious code.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The use of default passwords is a security concern but not malware. The code is standard and legitimate.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.3 seem appropriate given the default credentials concern.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly higher risk due to default passwords, but no malware. Scores are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar network transport code, handling SSL, cookies, auth, proxies.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code. Proper handling of SSL and cookies. No obfuscation or backdoors.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, standard implementation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Same general pattern—network transport, auth, cookies, SSL.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no backdoors. Use of getpass and environment variables is standard.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, standard code.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 fit.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, with no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varying, mostly low (0.1–0.3). The higher risk (0.3) in Report 3 is justified due to default passwords, which could be exploited if used improperly.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured network client for Impala, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (average of the reports, leaning towards low, but acknowledging default credentials in some code snippets)\n\nThis assessment confirms the code is safe and free from malicious intent.",
