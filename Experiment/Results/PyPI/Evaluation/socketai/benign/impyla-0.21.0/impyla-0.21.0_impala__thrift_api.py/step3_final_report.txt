{
  "purpose": "This code implements a custom HTTP transport class supporting SSL, cookies, proxy, and multiple authentication mechanisms for communicating with Impala services.",
  "sources": "URL parsing, environment variables, user input, server responses (cookies, headers).",
  "sinks": "Network requests, headers, cookies, SSL contexts.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment/user inputs into request headers and cookies; server responses update cookies; request retries occur on 401 responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or malicious code; default passwords ('password') are placeholders but pose security risks; SSL verify_mode can be insecure if misconfigured; no obfuscation or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured HTTP client supporting multiple auth methods, cookie management, SSL, and proxies. No malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or sabotage are present. Default credentials are security concerns but not malicious. SSL configurations with verify_mode=None are insecure but configurable. No signs of data exfiltration or remote code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an Impala HTTP transport class. It contains no malware or malicious behavior. The primary security concern is the use of default passwords and SSL verification settings, which should be addressed in deployment but do not indicate sabotage or malicious intent.",
