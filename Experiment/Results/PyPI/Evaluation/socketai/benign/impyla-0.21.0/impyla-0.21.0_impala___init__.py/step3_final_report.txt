  "purpose": "Define the version of the package and include license information as comments.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static code with license comments and version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward license comments and version string.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple header with license comments and a static version string assignment (__version__ = u'v0.21.0'). It contains no dynamic behavior, input/output, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is typical for package setup scripts and does not include any suspicious or malicious elements. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0 with high confidence. There are no anomalies or security concerns present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package metadata snippet with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate given the code's simplicity and static nature.",
