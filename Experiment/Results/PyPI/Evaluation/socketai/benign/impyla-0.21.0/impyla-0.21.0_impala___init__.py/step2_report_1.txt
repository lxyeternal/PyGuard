  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - The code is a standard header and version assignment in a Python package's setup script.\n   - It only contains license comments, an import for future compatibility, and a hardcoded version string (`__version__ = u'v0.21.0'`).\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security Risks & Malware**:\n   - The code is purely metadata; it does not process external data or perform any actions that could compromise security.\n   - The license comments are boilerplate and do not influence runtime behavior.\n   - The version string is hardcoded and not suspicious.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, the code is straightforward and readable.\n   - **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, there's no malicious activity or indicators.\n   - **Risk Score (0)**: Correct, the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or risks.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - All reports assign maximum confidence (1) and zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk scores, which is appropriate.\n   - No report suggests any suspicious behavior or assumptions that could be challenged.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- The code is benign, standard, and contains no security issues.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:\nThis is a typical, harmless package metadata snippet with no security concerns. The detailed reasoning confirms that the code is safe, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
