  "purpose": "The code appears to set up metadata for a Python package, specifically defining its version.",
  "sources": "The source is the hardcoded version string '__version__' and license comments, which are comments and a variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output sinks are present; the code only defines metadata.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks or vice versa; it solely assigns a string value to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is standard license header and version assignment with no suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code includes license information, which is standard for open-source projects. It assigns a version string to '__version__' and contains no runtime logic, user input handling, or external data processing. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as package metadata with no malicious intent or security issues.",
