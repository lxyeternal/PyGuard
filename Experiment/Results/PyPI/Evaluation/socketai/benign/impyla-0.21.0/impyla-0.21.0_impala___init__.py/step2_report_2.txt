  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code is a minimal setup snippet, defining a version string (`__version__ = u'v0.21.0'`) and including license comments.\n   - It imports `absolute_import` from `__future__` for compatibility.\n   - There are no dynamic operations, user inputs, external data processing, or network activity.\n   - The code is standard for package metadata, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues or Malicious Elements:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and contains no suspicious elements.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or data flows suggest any malicious intent.\n   - The license comments are boilerplate and do not impact security.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since there's no security risk or vulnerability.\n\n4. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - The only potential point of contention could be the version string's format (`v0.21.0`). While some might consider a 'v' prefix as a minor concern, it is standard in many projects and not inherently risky.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is entirely benign.\n   - The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code poses no security threat, and the reports correctly reflect that. No further action or concern is warranted.",
