  "purpose": "Set version information for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines a version string.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks since there are no input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal and standard; no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, defines a version string, and includes license comments. No code executes actions that could be malicious. No hardcoded secrets, no network activity, no data leakage. The license comments are standard boilerplate and do not influence security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version declaration with licensing comments. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
