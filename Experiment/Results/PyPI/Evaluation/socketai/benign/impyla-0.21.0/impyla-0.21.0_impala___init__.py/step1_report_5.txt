  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a setup or configuration script, mainly defining version information for a package.",
  "sources": "Reads the __version__ variable assignment; imports from __future__ module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths leading to untrusted sources or potential data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: import statement followed by version variable assignment; no data from external sources or untrusted inputs flows to any sink.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior observed. The version string is hardcoded but benign.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a future feature for compatibility, then sets a version string. It includes licensing comments and no runtime data processing or external data handling. There are no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The code is simple and standard for package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard part of a Python package's setup or version definition, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
