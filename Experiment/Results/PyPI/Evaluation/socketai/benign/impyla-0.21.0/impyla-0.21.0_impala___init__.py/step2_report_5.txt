  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple, static assignment of a version string with accompanying license comments.\n- The code is standard for a setup.py or similar package metadata file.\n- No input/output, network activity, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The license comments are boilerplate and do not influence security.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- Since the code is purely static metadata, there is no basis for higher risk or malware scores.\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, correctly concluding the code is benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's nature.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis code is a standard, harmless package metadata snippet with no security concerns.",
