{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a setup or configuration script for a Python package, primarily defining the package version.",
  "sources": "The source is the assignment of the __version__ variable with a hardcoded string.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or external outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "The flow involves setting a version variable; there are no complex flows or data transformations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and typical for setup scripts; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, defines a version string, and contains license comments. It does not perform any input/output operations, network activity, or execute dynamic code. The license comments are standard legal text and do not influence code behavior maliciously. The version is hardcoded but not suspicious or malicious. Overall, the script is straightforward and appears to be a benign configuration file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script fragment defining package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
