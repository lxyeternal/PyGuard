  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard extension with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It introduces minimal security risk primarily due to reliance on an external library, but the wrapper itself is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting low but present error handling complexity."
