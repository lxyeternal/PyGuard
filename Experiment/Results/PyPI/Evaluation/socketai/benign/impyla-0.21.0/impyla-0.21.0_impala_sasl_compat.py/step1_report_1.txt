  "purpose": "A custom subclass of SASLClient to handle SASL authentication with error capturing and simplified method interfaces.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to methods (mechanism, incoming, outgoing, challenge), error_catcher capturing exceptions, class initialization, and attribute access.",
  "sinks": "Return values of start, encode, decode, and step methods, especially the processed data and error messages.",
  "flows": "Method inputs (mechanism, incoming data, outgoing data, challenge) flow through error_catcher, then into methods like choose_mechanism, unwrap, wrap, process, with errors captured into self.error. Return values depend on these method outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies on external library puresasl.client.SASLClient; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious data handling found. Error handling is standard. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code extends a SASL client with error capturing to prevent exceptions from propagating, which is a common pattern for robustness. Methods call internal functions (choose_mechanism, unwrap, wrap, process) and handle errors gracefully by storing error messages. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be a straightforward wrapper intended for safer SASL interactions. The use of error_catcher is standard; no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of a SASL client with error handling for robustness. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. The code is structured and appears intended for safe usage in authentication flows.",
