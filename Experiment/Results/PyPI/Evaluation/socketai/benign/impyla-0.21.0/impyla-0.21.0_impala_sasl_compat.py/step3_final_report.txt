  "purpose": "A wrapper class extending SASLClient to add error handling and exception capturing for SASL operations.",
  "sources": "Methods such as choose_mechanism, unwrap, wrap, and process, which are invoked with incoming data or challenges.",
  "sinks": "The error_catcher captures exceptions; no data is sent to external sinks or network in this code.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through start, encode, decode, and step methods, with errors captured and stored in self.error.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard error handling and no obfuscated or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign subclass adding error handling to an external SASL client. It captures exceptions during core operations, storing error messages without altering core functionality. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behaviors are present. The external library usage is standard, and the error handling pattern is common. No hardcoded secrets or network operations are detected. The code is clear, well-structured, and serves as a robust wrapper for SASL interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard extension with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It introduces minimal security risk primarily due to reliance on an external library, but the wrapper itself is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting low but present error handling complexity.",
