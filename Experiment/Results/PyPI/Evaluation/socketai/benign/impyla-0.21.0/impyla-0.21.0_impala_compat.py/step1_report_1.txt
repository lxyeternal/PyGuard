  "purpose": "Provides compatibility functions for different Python versions and imports modules accordingly.",
  "sources": "Import statements and version checks that determine the code paths for compatibility.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code mainly defines compatibility functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of version-specific conditional code is standard. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up compatibility shims for Python 2 and Python 3, including definitions for 'lzip', 'Decimal', and '_xrange'. It uses standard libraries and conditional imports without any dynamic code execution or external data handling. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malicious code are present. The code's structure and imports are typical for cross-version compatibility modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard compatibility boilerplate with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs version detection and conditional imports, which are common and benign practices.",
