  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility functions for Python 2 and 3, including a custom zip function and handling for Decimal and range/xrange.",
  "sources": "Import statements for six, Decimal, and range/xrange, as well as the custom lzip function and import fallback logic.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code is purely for compatibility.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or obfuscation detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports compatibility libraries and defines functions to ensure cross-version compatibility between Python 2 and 3. The lzip function is defined conditionally based on the Python version. It also attempts to import Decimal from different modules depending on availability. The code handles differences in xrange/range between Python versions. All logic appears standard and intended solely for compatibility purposes. No signs of malicious or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions to provide cross-version support and does not include any malicious or malicious-looking code.",
