{
  "purpose": "Compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, defining functions and handling imports based on version detection.",
  "sources": "Version detection via six.PY3/PY2, import statements for 'decimal' and 'cdecimal', conditional definitions of 'lzip' and '_xrange'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks, no external data handling or network communication.",
  "flows": "Version detection leads to conditional imports and function definitions; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs; straightforward compatibility code.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard compatibility boilerplate, with clear version detection, conditional imports, and simple function definitions. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. The logic is correct, and the code is well-understood in open-source projects. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a compatibility shim without any malicious intent or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
