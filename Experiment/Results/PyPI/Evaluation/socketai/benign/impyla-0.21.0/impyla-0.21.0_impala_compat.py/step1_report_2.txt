{
  "purpose": "Provides compatibility functions for Python 2 and 3, such as a Python version-independent zip function and xrange/range aliasing, along with imports for decimal handling.",
  "sources": "Imports six for Python version detection, and conditional imports for decimal module (decimal or cdecimal).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data output or network connections.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only performs imports and simple function definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is standard compatibility boilerplate with no suspicious or unusual code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports compatibility libraries, defines a Python 2/3 compatible 'lzip' function, and manages import fallbacks for 'Decimal'. It also sets '_xrange' to 'xrange' or 'range' depending on the environment. All components are typical for ensuring cross-version compatibility and contain no malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard compatibility boilerplate with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated logic. It does not perform any network or data manipulation, nor does it include any suspicious code.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
