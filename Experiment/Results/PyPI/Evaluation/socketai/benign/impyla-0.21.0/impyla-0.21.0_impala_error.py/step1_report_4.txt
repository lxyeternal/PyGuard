  "purpose": "Define exception classes for Impala, including standard database API errors, RPC errors, and HTTP errors.",
  "sources": "Import of __future__ for absolute_import, and class definitions that do not read external input.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely declares classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard exception class definitions without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class declarations for a database client library. It imports a future feature for compatibility, and defines various exception subclasses without any logic, input/output, or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure and content are typical for a module defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign definition of exception classes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard library component for error handling in a database context.",
