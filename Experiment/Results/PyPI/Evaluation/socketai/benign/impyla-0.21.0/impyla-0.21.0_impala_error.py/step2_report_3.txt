  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of class definitions for exception handling related to Impala, Hive, and HTTP errors.\n   - There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.\n   - The code contains no data processing, input/output handling, or external data sources.\n   - The only method with logic is `__str__` in `HttpError`, which formats a string for error messages—this is standard practice.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent in stating that the code is purely structural, with no malicious or security-related issues.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of data flows, external inputs, or outputs.\n   - The analysis is accurate; the code is typical for defining exception classes.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any behavior that would warrant a higher risk score.\n   - The code is standard exception class definitions, with no signs of malicious activity.\n   - Therefore, risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious behavior is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious and assume benign intent, which is justified.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities are made.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n   - The confidence levels are high, which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious intent are evident.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the analysis, confirming that the code is safe and non-malicious.",
