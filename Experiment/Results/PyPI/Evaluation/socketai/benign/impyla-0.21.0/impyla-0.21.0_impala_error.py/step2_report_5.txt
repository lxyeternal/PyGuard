  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the purpose, code content, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling related to Impala, Hive, RPC, and HTTP errors.\n- There are no external data inputs, outputs, network calls, or dynamic behaviors.\n- The only method with logic is `__str__` in `HttpError`, which formats a message for display.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code appears to be a standard, straightforward implementation of custom exception classes.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on code presence:\n- The classes are all present and correctly defined.\n- No discrepancies between the code and the reports’ descriptions.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are evident.\n- The code is syntactically correct and adheres to Python conventions.\n- No logic errors or security issues are apparent.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5, with 0 being most appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely class definitions with no dynamic or external interactions, a risk score of **0** is justified.\n- No indication of security vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or obfuscation.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- Some reports mention \"no external input sources\" and \"no data flows,\" which is accurate.\n- The only method with logic (`__str__`) is benign.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed; the code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign exception class hierarchy for error handling in database and RPC contexts. It does not pose any security threat or contain malicious behavior.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
