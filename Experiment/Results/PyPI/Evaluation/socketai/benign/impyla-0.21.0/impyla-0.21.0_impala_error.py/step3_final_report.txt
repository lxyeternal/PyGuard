{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for Impala, Hive, RPC, and HTTP errors, serving as a structured error handling framework.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definitions and the __str__ method in HttpError for message formatting.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; exception classes are static definitions with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class hierarchy with minimal logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of exception classes for database and RPC error handling. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The only method with logic is __str__ in HttpError, which safely formats an error message. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and structure indicate a benign purpose, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions for error handling. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The existing scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and appropriate.",
