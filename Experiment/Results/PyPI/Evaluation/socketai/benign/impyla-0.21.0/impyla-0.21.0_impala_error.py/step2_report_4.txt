  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, the scoring, and the logical consistency.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code is a set of Python class definitions for custom exceptions related to Impala, Hive, and HTTP errors.\n- It imports `absolute_import` from `__future__` for compatibility.\n- Exception classes inherit from built-in exception classes, with minimal additional logic.\n- The only method with logic is `__str__` in `HttpError`, which formats an error message.\n- No external data handling, input/output, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward class definitions with no vulnerabilities or malicious elements.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code appears correct and standard for defining exception classes.\n\n- **Scores given in reports:**\n  - **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This aligns with the code content.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 in all reports. No obfuscation detected.\n  - **Risk score:** 0 or very close to it. This is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Critical Analysis of the Reports:\n- All reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The detailed analysis confirms that the code is purely structural, with no dynamic or external data processing.\n- The `__str__` method in `HttpError` is straightforward and does not introduce security issues.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- The **malware score** of 0 is justified across all reports.\n- The **obfuscated score** of 0 is justified.\n- The **security risk** score of 0 is appropriate, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- No discrepancies noted. The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (benign, standard exception class definitions)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, harmless set of exception class definitions for a database client library. The reports are consistent, and the scores reflect the actual content accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is safe, clear, and standard.\n- No changes needed in the scoring.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements present.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
