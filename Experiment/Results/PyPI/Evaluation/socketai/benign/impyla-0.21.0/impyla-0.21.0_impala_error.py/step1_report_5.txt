  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Impala and related RPC errors, adhering to PEP 249 standards.",
  "sources": "Import statement for __future__.absolute_import; class definitions and their methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output, network, or data handling functions are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with a straightforward inheritance structure. It includes a constructor for HttpError that assigns parameters to object attributes and a __str__ method for formatted string output. There are no functions that process untrusted data, no input handling, no external data sources, and no network or system interactions. The import statement is benign, intended for compatibility across Python versions. Overall, the code appears to be purely structural and documentation-related, with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of exception class definitions serving as part of an API for Impala error handling. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. The code is straightforward, with no indications of malware, security issues, or obfuscation.",
