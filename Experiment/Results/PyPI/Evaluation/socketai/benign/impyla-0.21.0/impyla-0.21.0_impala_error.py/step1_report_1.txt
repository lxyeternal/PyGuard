  "purpose": "Define exception classes for Impala, Hive, and HTTP-related errors, following PEP 249 and including custom error handling.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present; the code solely defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or processing logic; only class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python class definitions for exception handling related to database and RPC errors. It imports future features for compatibility, and defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes with no additional logic or external data handling. The HttpError class includes a __str__ method for formatted error messages. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be straightforward and intended solely for error representation.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard implementation of exception classes for database and RPC errors. It contains no malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks. The code is clean, well-structured, and solely focused on error handling.",
