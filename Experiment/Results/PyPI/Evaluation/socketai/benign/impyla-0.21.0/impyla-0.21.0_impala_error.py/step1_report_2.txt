  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Impala database and RPC errors, including PEP 249 compliance.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; exception classes do not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output generation.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code purely defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, inheriting from built-in exception classes. The only method with logic is __str__ in HttpError, which formats a string for HTTP error codes. There are no input/output operations, no external data handling, and no code execution or obfuscation patterns. The classes serve as structured error representations, and do not include any suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for database and RPC errors, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
