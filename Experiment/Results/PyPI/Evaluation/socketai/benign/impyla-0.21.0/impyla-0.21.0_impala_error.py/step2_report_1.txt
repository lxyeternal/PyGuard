  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Purpose**:\n   - The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for Impala, Hive, RPC, and HTTP errors.\n   - It uses standard Python inheritance from built-in exceptions.\n   - The only method with logic is `__str__` in `HttpError`, which formats an error message.\n   - There are no data flows, external inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The import is for compatibility (`__future__.absolute_import`), a common practice.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Code or Anomalies**:\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n   - No suspicious patterns, such as dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling.\n   - The code appears to be purely structural, intended for error handling.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is consistent and appropriate. No evidence of malicious intent.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct given the straightforward nature.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, indicating no security risk. This is reasonable because the code is purely class definitions with no runtime behavior that could introduce risk.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Misjudgments**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No changes needed in scores; they align with the code's nature.\n   - The analysis in each report is thorough and reasonable.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is purely for defining exceptions, it inherently poses no security threat.\n   - The `HttpError` class's `__str__` method is simple and safe.\n   - No external dependencies or data handling are involved.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard, clean implementation of exception classes.\n   - It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements.\n   - The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and reasonable.\n\n**Final Estimate**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThis code is a benign, standard implementation of exception classes for database and RPC error handling. It contains no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The existing scores and assessments are appropriate.",
