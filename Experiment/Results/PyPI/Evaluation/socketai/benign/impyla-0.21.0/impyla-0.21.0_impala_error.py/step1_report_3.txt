  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Impala, adhering to PEP 249, including handling of RPC and HTTP errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements and class definitions; no external input reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code solely defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of exception classes with inheritance hierarchies. It includes a custom __str__ method for HttpError but does not process or handle external data dynamically. The code is standard for defining exceptions, with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in Impala-related modules. It poses no security threats, contains no malicious behavior, and does not exhibit obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
