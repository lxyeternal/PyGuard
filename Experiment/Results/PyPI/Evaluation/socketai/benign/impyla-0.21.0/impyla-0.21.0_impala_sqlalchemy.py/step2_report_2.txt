  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard schema inspection and version retrieval via safe SQL commands.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from connection parameters and function arguments into SQL queries, which are executed. No untrusted input is directly embedded into queries—parameters are controlled by the application.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The code interacts with the database in a typical, secure manner.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malware or security risk detected; high confidence (0.9). The malware score is 0, which seems appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard schema and version info retrieval.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses 'text' SQL constructs, but with controlled inputs. No evidence of injection or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns; code appears legitimate.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, benign code with high confidence. Malware score is 0, matching the analysis.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is solid; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above—schema inspection, version queries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard SQL commands; no untrusted input handling that could lead to injection.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a typical dialect implementation with no malware signs. Malware score is 0, security risk is low.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is justified; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focused on schema reflection and connection management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Executes standard queries; no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate dialect code, no malware. Malware score 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The evaluation aligns well with the code; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard schema and version info retrieval.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses fixed queries; no untrusted input manipulation.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate implementation, low risk, malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; scores are suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence:** The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an SQLAlchemy dialect for Impala.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware or obfuscation in any report.\n- **Security Risk:** The risk scores are all low (around 0.1 to 0.2), which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All reports' scores align with their analyses.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk Score:** Approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal security concern, mainly due to the execution of dynamic SQL queries, but these are controlled and standard.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, benign database dialect implementation with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.",
