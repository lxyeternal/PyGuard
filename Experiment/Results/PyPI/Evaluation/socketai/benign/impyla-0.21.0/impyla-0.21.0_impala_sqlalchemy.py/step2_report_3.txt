  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code implements an SQLAlchemy dialect for Impala, focusing on schema introspection and connection management.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Uses connection parameters and executes SQL queries like 'select version()' and 'SHOW TABLES'. No untrusted input is directly used in query construction; dynamic parts are based on function arguments, expected to be controlled by the application.\n- **Flows:** Data flows from connection parameters and function arguments into SQL commands; results are parsed.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears standard, legitimate, and free of malicious behavior. It’s a typical database driver extension.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.1 (minimal, due to standard schema introspection functions)\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it details an Impala SQLAlchemy dialect with type mappings and schema functions.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Executes 'text' SQL commands for version and schema info. No untrusted input appears to be mishandled.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** A standard, benign implementation. No malware or malicious intent detected.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.0 (completely benign)\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical Impala dialect implementation with schema and version queries.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Executes straightforward SQL commands, no suspicious input handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard, legitimate code with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.2 (still very low, typical schema reflection)\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, standard dialect functions for schema introspection.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Executes 'SHOW TABLES', 'SHOW SCHEMAS', 'select version()' with no evidence of malicious input.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate, benign code.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Standard dialect with schema and version info retrieval.\n- **Sources & Sinks:** Executes standard queries; no untrusted input manipulation.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate implementation.\n\n**Score Justification:**\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0.0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Consistently 0, as the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly reflecting the use of dynamic SQL queries based on function arguments, which are expected to be controlled by the application, not external untrusted sources.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code is a typical, well-structured open-source dialect implementation for Impala.\n- No signs of supply chain compromise, malware, or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to dynamic query construction, but standard in such implementations)\n\nThis detailed review confirms that the code is safe and legitimate, with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
