  "malware": 0,

  "securityRisk": 0.1,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "purpose": "Implementation of an SQLAlchemy dialect for Impala, enabling schema reflection, version checking, and connection management.",
  "sources": "Connection parameters, SQL commands like 'select version()', 'SHOW TABLES', 'SHOW SCHEMAS', executed via connection.execute() with controlled inputs.",
  "sinks": "Execution of SQL queries that could potentially be influenced if inputs are untrusted, but in this code, inputs are controlled and parameterized.",
  "flows": "From connection parameters and function arguments into SQL commands, then into database execution, with results parsed for schema info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a legitimate, open-source implementation of an Impala dialect for SQLAlchemy, focusing on schema introspection and version retrieval. It executes standard SQL commands with no untrusted input embedded directly into queries. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The functions perform expected tasks such as retrieving table names, schema info, and version details. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code. The minimal risk score reflects the potential surface if inputs were mishandled, but as implemented, it is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of an Impala SQLAlchemy dialect with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is negligible, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
