{
  "purpose": "This code defines a SQLAlchemy dialect for Impala, supporting different Impala versions and customizing SQL compilation and connection behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports modules like re, sqlalchemy components, and impala.dbapi; registers dialects and reads connection parameters; executes 'select version()' and 'SHOW SCHEMAS' queries.",
  "sinks": "Executes SQL queries via connection.execute; accesses connection.connection.default_db; formats schema and table names; calls cursor methods; constructs and runs specific SQL commands like 'SHOW TABLES', 'select version()'.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (connection strings, schema names) flow into SQL commands; version info retrieved via 'select version()'; schema/table info fetched via 'SHOW' commands; connection data used in connection and execution methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hard-coded secrets, or backdoors detected. The code performs standard SQLAlchemy dialect customization and query execution without obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an Impala dialect for SQLAlchemy, including version handling, schema inspection, and table metadata retrieval. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or malicious network activity. All SQL queries appear to serve legitimate purposes like version checking and schema listing. No hardcoded credentials or unsafe code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an Impala SQLAlchemy dialect without malicious intent. It performs typical database schema and version queries securely and transparently. No indicators of malware or malicious behavior are detected.",
