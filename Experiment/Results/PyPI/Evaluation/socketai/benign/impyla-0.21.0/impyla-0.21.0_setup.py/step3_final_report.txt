  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the 'impyla' Python client library.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or user inputs; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration is static.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated 'ez_setup' module, but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for Python packaging, involving static data and standard practices. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The use of 'ez_setup' is outdated but not malicious. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor use of deprecated modules does not impact security. The overall assessment confirms no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
