  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims and the associated scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a typical `setup.py` script for packaging the 'impyla' Python client.\n- The code reads a local README file, defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.\n- No dynamic data, user input, or network activity is involved.\n- The use of `ez_setup` is deprecated but not malicious.\n- No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- All reports agree that the code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is a standard setup script; no malicious activity or code injection is present.\n- No untrusted data sources or data flows involving untrusted inputs.\n- No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.\n- Use of deprecated `ez_setup` is noted but not malicious.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The only notable flaw is the use of `ez_setup`, which is deprecated. This isn't a security issue but indicates outdated practices.\n- No other errors or security flaws are present.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Most reports assign 0, with one report assigning 0.1. Given the analysis, a score of 0.1 seems slightly high for a benign setup script, but it could be a conservative placeholder.\n\n### Justification of higher risk scores:\n- The report that assigns 0.1 risk score (Report 5) should justify this with reasoning, but no such justification is provided. Since the code is standard, the risk score should remain at 0.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis; no suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is a typical, benign package setup script with no security issues.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                      |\n| Risk           | 0                      |\n\n**Workings:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard.\n- No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The use of deprecated modules is not malicious but indicates outdated practices.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources.\n\n**Conclusion:** The package setup code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
