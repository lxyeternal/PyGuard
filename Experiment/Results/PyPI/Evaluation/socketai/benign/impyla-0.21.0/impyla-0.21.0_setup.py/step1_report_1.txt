{
  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration for packaging and distributing the 'impyla' Python client for Impala.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; hardcoded package metadata such as name, version, description, author info, URL, install requirements, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data sources could be the contents of 'README.md' or external inputs for version or URLs, but these are hardcoded and controlled. No untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "N/A, as all data is statically defined or read from controlled files; no dynamic data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; use of deprecated 'ez_setup' module, but no malicious activity. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and third-party modules for package setup. It defines a function to read a README file, then calls 'setup()' with various metadata parameters, including package data, dependencies, and entry points. All data appears static and intended for package distribution. No code injection, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors are present. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It mainly configures package metadata for distribution, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
