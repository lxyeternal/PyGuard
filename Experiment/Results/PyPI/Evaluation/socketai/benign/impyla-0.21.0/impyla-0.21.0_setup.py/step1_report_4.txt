{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'impyla' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, package data inclusion, and specified dependencies in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "None of the data sources directly feed into sinks that could cause data leaks or malicious behavior. The 'readme()' function reads a local file; dependencies are specified explicitly.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reading into the package setup process, with dependencies declared for later use; no untrusted data flows into dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected; standard setup script with clear dependency declarations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script using setuptools. It reads a local README file for the long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All dependencies are explicit and sourced from known repositories. No code injection, dynamic execution, or malicious logic observed. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate, standard package setup for 'impyla' with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
