  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'impyla' Python package, used for installing and configuring the package with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; static package metadata and dependency declarations; standard import statements and function definitions.",
  "sinks": "None evident. No handling of untrusted data, user input, or network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A. No data flows involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is a standard setup script with conventional practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script performs package setup using setuptools. It imports necessary modules, reads a markdown file for description, and specifies package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. The code structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or external data handling beyond reading a local file. The dependencies specified are well-known packages with no suspicious references. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard.",
