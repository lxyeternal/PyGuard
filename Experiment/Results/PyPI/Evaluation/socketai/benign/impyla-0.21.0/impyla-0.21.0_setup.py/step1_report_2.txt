  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'impyla' Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, package definitions, dependency specifications, and metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "None identifiable; no untrusted data processing or external data transmission present.",
  "flows": "Reading README file during setup; defining package data and dependencies; no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'ez_setup' which is deprecated; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily uses standard setuptools procedures for Python package setup. It reads a README file for long description, specifies dependencies, and defines entry points. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. The code adheres to typical setup.py patterns and includes license information and package metadata. There are no suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Use of deprecated 'ez_setup' is noted but not malicious. Overall, the script performs normal package configuration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup.py script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies, with no evidence of malware, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.",
