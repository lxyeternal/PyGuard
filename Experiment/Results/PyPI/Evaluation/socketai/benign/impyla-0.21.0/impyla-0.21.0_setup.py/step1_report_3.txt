{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration and metadata for the impyla Python package, including dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "File system reading 'README.md'; package data files; dependencies specified in 'install_requires' and 'extras_require'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data affects system state or leaks; no network calls or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' from filesystem; importing setup tools; defining package metadata and dependencies; registering entry points.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; standard setup script with no obfuscated or dynamic code; no hardcoded secrets or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script utilizing setuptools. It reads a local README file for long description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers. There are no dynamic or malicious code segments, no network activity, and no obfuscated elements. Usage of 'ez_setup' to use setuptools is common in older packages. All operations are standard for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal package setup script with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It simply defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
