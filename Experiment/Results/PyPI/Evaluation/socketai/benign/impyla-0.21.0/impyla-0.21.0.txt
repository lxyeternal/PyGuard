      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign bootstrap utility for setuptools installation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is the insecure download method, which could be exploited if URLs are compromised, but this is an explicit, documented fallback. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), justified by the insecure download option but not indicative of malicious intent."

The primary security concern is the use of default passwords and SSL verification settings, which should be addressed in deployment but do not indicate sabotage or malicious intent."

The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal security risk score reflects standard configuration warnings rather than actual threats."

It introduces minimal security risk primarily due to reliance on an external library, but the wrapper itself is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1-0.2, reflecting low but present error handling complexity."
