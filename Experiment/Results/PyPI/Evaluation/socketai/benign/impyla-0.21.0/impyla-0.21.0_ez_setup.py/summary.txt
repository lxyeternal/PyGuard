  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign bootstrap utility for setuptools installation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is the insecure download method, which could be exploited if URLs are compromised, but this is an explicit, documented fallback. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2), justified by the insecure download option but not indicative of malicious intent."
