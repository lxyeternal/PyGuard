{
  "purpose": "Provides a client interface for Microsoft Translator API, managing credentials, endpoints, and authentication policies for text translation services.",
  "sources": "Reads credentials (AzureKeyCredential or TokenCredential), region, resource_id, audience, and endpoint parameters to configure request headers and URLs.",
  "sinks": "Sets authentication headers (e.g., Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key, Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region, Ocp-Apim-ResourceId) and constructs endpoint URLs for API requests.",
  "flows": "Credential objects influence header values; endpoint URL is built based on input parameters; headers are set before API calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code follows standard SDK design patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code manages credentials securely, constructs API endpoints dynamically, and sets request headers appropriately. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. Authentication policies are standard, and the code is straightforward and well-structured. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign and standard SDK nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SDK client for Azure Translator services, with no malicious intent or security risks. The high malware score in the initial report (0.9) should be lowered to 0.1 to reflect the benign nature. Overall, the code is safe, clear, and properly manages credentials and endpoints.",
