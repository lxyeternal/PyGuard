  "purpose": "Configuration class for the TextTranslationClient, setting up policies and parameters for API interaction.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to __init__, especially 'endpoint' and 'kwargs' for policies.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flows to untrusted external sources or sensitive data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into object attributes and policy initializations; no external data or untrusted sources processed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard use of policies and parameter handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class for a client, initializing with endpoint and optional policies. It performs validation on 'endpoint', sets default values, and initializes multiple policy objects. All behaviors are typical for SDK configuration classes, with no signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. There are no network calls or data manipulations that indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be standard SDK setup code, with clear structure and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical SDK configuration class for setting up API policies and parameters. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code is straightforward and secure.",
