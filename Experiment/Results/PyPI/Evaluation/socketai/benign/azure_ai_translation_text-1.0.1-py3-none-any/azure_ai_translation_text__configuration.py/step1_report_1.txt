  "purpose": "Configuration class for setting up the TextTranslationClient with various policies and parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'endpoint' and keyword arguments (**kwargs) for configuration.",
  "sinks": "No external untrusted data is directly written or transmitted in this code.",
  "flows": "Initialization flows from input parameters to internal attributes; policies are instantiated using provided kwargs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or malicious code present. No obfuscated code or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class for a client, primarily setting up policies for network behavior. It accepts an endpoint URL and optional configuration parameters, and initializes various policy objects using the provided kwargs or defaults. The endpoint is validated to be non-None. No external data is processed or transmitted unsafely; no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration setup for a client library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It properly validates input and initializes policies safely.",
