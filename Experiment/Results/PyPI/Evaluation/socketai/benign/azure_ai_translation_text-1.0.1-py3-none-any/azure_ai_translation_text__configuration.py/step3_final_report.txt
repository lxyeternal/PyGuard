  "purpose": "Configuration class for setting up the TextTranslationClient with various policies and parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'endpoint'; optional kwargs for policies and settings.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input validation of 'endpoint' -> Policy instantiations with kwargs -> Policies used in client setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK configuration class. It validates 'endpoint', sets default parameters, and initializes policies using standard imported classes. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The code structure and logic are sound, with no signs of obfuscation or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing standard SDK setup logic without malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
