  "purpose": "Configuration class for the TextTranslationClient, setting up various policies and parameters for API interaction.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as 'endpoint' and keyword arguments (**kwargs) during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Uses policies that may involve network operations or headers, but no untrusted data sinks are directly present in this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to class attributes; policies are instantiated with provided arguments. No untrusted data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be standard configuration setup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class for an API client, initializing parameters like 'endpoint' and 'api_version'. It sets default values and creates policy instances for HTTP requests. No data is received from external sources beyond constructor parameters. No network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code uses standard practices for API configuration without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical configuration class for setting up a client to interact with an API. It contains no malware indicators, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured.",
