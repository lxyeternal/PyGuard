{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an auto-generated module for a Microsoft translation SDK, mainly importing classes and setting version info.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_patch, _version), and the assignment of __version__ from VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up module imports and initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports SDK components and version info, then invokes a patch function. It is standard boilerplate code generated for SDK modules. No dynamic code execution, no external data sources, no network activity, and no security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, auto-generated SDK module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
