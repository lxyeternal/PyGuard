  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the provided scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is auto-generated SDK boilerplate, importing modules, setting version info, and invoking a patch function. No suspicious activity, data flow, or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's content. No issues or malicious signs are present.\n- **Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard SDK setup, no suspicious behavior, no external data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** The analysis correctly identifies the code as benign, with no malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on initializing and configuring the translation SDK, with no suspicious code or data flow.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard SDK setup, and the scores reflect that.\n- **Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with mention of the patch function and standard setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The only point to consider is the securityRisk=0.1. The code calls `_patch_sdk()`, which could potentially modify SDK behavior. However, without evidence of malicious or suspicious behavior, this risk is minimal.\n- **Justification for securityRisk=0.1:** The call to `_patch_sdk()` could, in theory, modify SDK behavior, but there's no evidence that it does anything malicious. The low score is reasonable.\n- **Verdict:** **Scores are acceptable, though slightly conservative.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard SDK import and setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** **Scores are appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** Very low, mostly 0, with a slight 0.1 in one report due to the `_patch_sdk()` call, which is reasonable.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — very minimal, justified by the potential for `_patch_sdk()` to alter SDK behavior, but no evidence suggests malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are reasonable given the code's nature. No further escalation or concern is warranted based on this snippet.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the benign, auto-generated SDK setup code with negligible security concerns.",
