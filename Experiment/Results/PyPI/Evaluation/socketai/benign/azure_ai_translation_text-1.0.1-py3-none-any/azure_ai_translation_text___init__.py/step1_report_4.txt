{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to initialize and configure a Python SDK client for text translation, including importing modules, setting version information, and applying a patch via _patch_sdk.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_patch, _version), and usage of __version__ and __all__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data outputs, network operations, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules (TextTranslationClient, VERSION) to module variables (__version__, __all__), and then calls _patch_sdk() which presumably patches or initializes SDK components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, variable assignments, and a function call (_patch_sdk). It includes license comments and a warning that changes may cause incorrect behavior, which is typical for generated SDK code. No external data input, network calls, or suspicious behavior are detected. The code appears standard for SDK initialization, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK bootstrap script with no malicious behavior detected. It appears safe and primarily serves to set up SDK components for use.",
