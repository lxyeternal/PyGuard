  "purpose": "This code initializes an SDK module for Microsoft translation services, importing necessary components, setting version info, and applying patches as part of standard setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_patch, _version), and the call to _patch_sdk()",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks",
  "flows": "Import statements and the invocation of _patch_sdk() during module initialization",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and auto-generated with no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, auto-generated SDK setup module with imports, version assignment, and a patch function call. No network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present. The _patch_sdk() function is standard in SDK initialization routines and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs. All signals point to benign, boilerplate setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign SDK initialization module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify this, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
