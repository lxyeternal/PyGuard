  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as boilerplate, auto-generated SDK setup code.\n- No network activity, data processing, or external input handling is evident.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code constructs are detected.\n- The only function called is `_patch_sdk()`, which in SDKs typically applies patches or initializes components, standard practice.\n- The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or any dynamic code execution.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Benign, auto-generated module for SDK setup; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard SDK setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Similar SDK initialization, standard import and patching.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Slightly higher confidence (0.9), with a small securityRisk (0.1). The mention that `_patch_sdk()` \"presumably patches or initializes SDK components\" is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The securityRisk score is marginal; since the code is standard SDK setup, this is acceptable. No evidence of actual risk.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same as others, straightforward SDK setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected. The code is boilerplate SDK setup.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware:** Zero, as expected.\n- **Security risk:** Zero or negligible, as the code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The minimal securityRisk score in report 4 is justified given the standard nature of `_patch_sdk()`, which could modify SDK behavior but is typical and not inherently malicious.\n- No report overestimates the malware or obfuscated scores.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — standard SDK setup with no security concerns.\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and typical SDK boilerplate code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate in their benign assessment. No modifications needed.",
