  "purpose": "Serialization and deserialization of data for REST API communication, supporting formats like JSON, XML, date/time, base64, and model objects.",
  "sources": "Input data streams, HTTP headers, response bodies, and internal model attributes.",
  "sinks": "Generated JSON/XML data for network transmission, request bodies, URL parameters, and headers.",
  "flows": "Data is read from streams or responses, processed through format-specific methods, and output as JSON/XML/primitive types for API communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() in serialize_basic() and deserialize_basic() functions to convert string type names into Python types.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard serialization/deserialization tasks typical of SDK utilities. The primary security concern is the use of eval(), which can execute arbitrary code if data_type is influenced by untrusted input. While the code is otherwise straightforward and free of malicious network activity or obfuscation, eval() introduces a significant potential for code injection if misused. The risk is controlled if data_type is strictly validated, but eval() should be replaced with explicit type mappings to mitigate this risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK utility with no active malicious behavior. The main security issue is the eval() pattern, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated. Therefore, the malware score should be set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk to approximately 0.6 due to eval() usage. Replacing eval() with a safe type mapping is strongly recommended to eliminate this vulnerability.",
