  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK utility with no active malicious behavior. The main security issue is the eval() pattern, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated. Therefore, the malware score should be set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk to approximately 0.6 due to eval() usage. Replacing eval() with a safe type mapping is strongly recommended to eliminate this vulnerability."
