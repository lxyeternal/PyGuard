      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SDK client for Azure Translator services, with no malicious intent or security risks. The high malware score in the initial report (0.9) should be lowered to 0.1 to reflect the benign nature. Overall, the code is safe, clear, and properly manages credentials and endpoints."

The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are appropriate. The code's behavior aligns with safe data handling practices, and no vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are detected."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK utility with no active malicious behavior. The main security issue is the eval() pattern, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated. Therefore, the malware score should be set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk to approximately 0.6 due to eval() usage. Replacing eval() with a safe type mapping is strongly recommended to eliminate this vulnerability."
