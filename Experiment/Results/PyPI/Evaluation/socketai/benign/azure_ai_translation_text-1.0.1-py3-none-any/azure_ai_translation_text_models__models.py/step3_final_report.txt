{
  "purpose": "The code defines data models for a translation SDK, primarily auto-generated classes for JSON serialization/deserialization with no runtime logic or external interactions.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; purely class definitions for JSON data mapping.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows to external systems or network activity.",
  "flows": "None; static data models only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data model classes inheriting from a base model, with constructor overloads for JSON initialization and no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The models serve as schemas for API responses and requests, with standard patterns and no runtime logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe, standard SDK data models with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is effectively 0, reflecting negligible security concern.",
