{
  "purpose": "Defines data models for Azure translation text API responses and requests, including language detection, translation, dictionary lookup, and transliteration.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, rest_field definitions, and property initializations used to create and populate model instances from JSON or direct parameters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data directly; model initialization with external data is standard for API response deserialization.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON input to model properties during object initialization; no data is processed or transmitted outside the scope of model creation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors; code is strictly focused on data modeling. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or external network calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of class definitions representing data structures for translation models, with no functions executing logic or external interactions. It uses standard patterns for data models, including constructor overloads for JSON deserialization. The code appears auto-generated from a schema, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. All data handling seems to be within the scope of API response/model population. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely a collection of data models for the Azure translation service API, with no malicious or security-risk behaviors. It is a standard implementation of model classes for data serialization/deserialization, and there are no indications of sabotage or malware.",
