{
  "purpose": "Define data models for a translation service SDK, including translation results, language detection, dictionary entries, and error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from JSON inputs during object initialization; no external input sources or untrusted data sources are directly used in the code.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely defines data models and constructors for serialization/deserialization.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated and primarily consists of data class definitions with minimal logic. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. No dynamic code execution, system calls, or network operations are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines data models with type annotations and optional initializer overloads for JSON mapping. It imports standard typing features and a base model class, with no evidence of runtime behavior or external interactions. The structure suggests auto-generation from a schema, with no code that could be malicious or maliciously altered. All data handling appears to be confined to serialization/deserialization of JSON data with no side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of data model definitions for a translation API SDK, with no malicious intent or behavior detected. It serves as a schema for data exchange and does not contain code that could execute malicious actions.",
