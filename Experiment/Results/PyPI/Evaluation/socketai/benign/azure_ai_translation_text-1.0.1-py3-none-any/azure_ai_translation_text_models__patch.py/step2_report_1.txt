  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code is a minimal template for SDK customization, containing:\n     - Licensing comments.\n     - A module docstring with a link to customization instructions.\n     - An import of `List` from `typing`.\n     - An empty list `__all__` for public API exports.\n     - A placeholder function `patch_sdk()` with a docstring, but no implementation.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, file operations, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is purely structural, intended for user extension.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No data processing, no external input sources, no sinks.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious constructs.\n   - The function `patch_sdk()` is a placeholder for user customization, not executing any code itself.\n\n3. **Evaluation of Reports**:\n   - All five reports uniformly describe the code as a benign, boilerplate template with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.\n   - They correctly identify that the code does not process data, read external sources, or perform any suspicious operations.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1.0, indicating high certainty in their assessments.\n   - The malware scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The security risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Scores Consistency and Justification**:\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is detected.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is straightforward and readable.\n   - The overall security risk score of 0 is justified given the lack of any security-sensitive operations.\n   - The reports are consistent with each other and with the code's content.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Assumptions**:\n   - The reports assume that the code is a static template with no malicious payloads, which is accurate.\n   - There are no assumptions about hidden behaviors or obfuscated code, which is also correct.\n\n6. **Final Recommendations**:\n   - Based on the analysis, I agree with the reports' assessments.\n   - The scores are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n   - No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**Summary of my own estimate**:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThis code is a benign, standard SDK customization template with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
