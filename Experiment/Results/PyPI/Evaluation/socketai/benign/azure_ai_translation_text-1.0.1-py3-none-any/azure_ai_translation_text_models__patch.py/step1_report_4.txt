{
  "purpose": "The code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code for Azure SDKs in Python, allowing users to add customizations without modifying the auto-generated code directly.",
  "sources": "The code reads static imports and function definitions; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data or external input could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows as no input or external data processing is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only boilerplate template comments, an empty list for exports, and a placeholder function. No unusual code, secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal, boilerplate Python file intended for customization of an SDK. It includes licensing information, a module docstring, an import statement, a definition of __all__, and an empty function 'patch_sdk'. There are no data inputs, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are detected. The code's simplicity and purpose as a customization template mean it does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless SDK customization template with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves as a placeholder for user modifications and does not perform any operations that could compromise security.",
