{
  "purpose": "The code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code from Microsoft, mainly for documentation and extension purposes.",
  "sources": "No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No data is written or transmitted; no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks as the code does not process data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs; it is a typical SDK customization template.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward template with a license header, a descriptive docstring, an import statement, an empty list for public objects, and a simple function 'patch_sdk' with a docstring. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external data handling are present. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be an intentionally minimal placeholder for SDK customization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a customization placeholder for an SDK, with no signs of malware, malicious activity, or security risks.",
