  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code is a minimal Python template for SDK customization, containing:\n     - Licensing comments.\n     - Module docstring.\n     - An import of `List` from `typing`.\n     - An empty `__all__` list.\n     - A placeholder function `patch_sdk()` with a docstring, but no executable code.\n   - There are no data processing, network operations, file I/O, or external inputs.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Report Summaries:**\n   - All five reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, a standard SDK customization template, with no malicious behavior, no data flows, no sinks, and no anomalies.\n   - They assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, with confidence scores of 1.0.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as a benign scaffold for user customization.\n\n3. **Logical and Scoring Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code analysis; no suspicious activity or malware is detected.\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is straightforward and human-readable.\n   - The security risk score is 0, given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious features.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code is a template with no dynamic or external elements, there are no grounds to challenge the reports’ conclusions.\n   - The reports do not assume any malicious intent; they correctly interpret the code as a benign placeholder.\n\n5. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n   - The scores reflect the code's nature accurately.\n   - No modifications are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\nThis code is a benign, standard SDK customization scaffold with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code content.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a safe, minimal placeholder for SDK customization, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. The scoring and conclusions are appropriate.",
