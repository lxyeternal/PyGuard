  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, boilerplate template for SDK customization, primarily containing licensing comments, import statements, an empty `__all__` list, and a placeholder function `patch_sdk()` with a docstring.\n- No data processing, input/output, network activity, or external dependencies are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs are identified.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports agree that there are no security issues, no malicious code, and no vulnerabilities. The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  **No.** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a benign template with no security concerns.\n\n- **Scores assigned to issues:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature. These scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  Not applicable here; all scores are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n- **Malware score reflection:**  \n  Correctly set to 0, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports base their conclusions on the code's structure and content, not assumptions.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The code is purely structural, serving as a placeholder for user customization in SDK generation.\n- There are no dynamic or external elements that could be exploited.\n- The uniformity across reports suggests a clear consensus that this code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, well-documented template with no malicious or suspicious elements. The absence of any data flow, external input, or network activity confirms a negligible security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports correctly identify this code as benign. No modifications to scores are necessary. The overall assessment aligns with the provided analysis.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- Continue monitoring for any code that introduces external data handling or dynamic behavior in similar templates.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a safe, standard SDK customization scaffold with no security concerns.",
