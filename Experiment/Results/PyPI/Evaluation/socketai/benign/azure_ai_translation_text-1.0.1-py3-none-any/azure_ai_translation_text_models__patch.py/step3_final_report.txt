  "purpose": "A minimal SDK customization template for user modifications, containing licensing info, documentation, and a placeholder function.",
  "sources": "No data inputs, external sources, or dynamic data; only static code elements.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows, external calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code is static with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static template with licensing comments, a documentation string, an import, an empty __all__ list, and a placeholder function. No data processing, network activity, or external dependencies are present. The code's purpose is to serve as a customizable scaffold. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions justify these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard SDK customization scaffold with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
