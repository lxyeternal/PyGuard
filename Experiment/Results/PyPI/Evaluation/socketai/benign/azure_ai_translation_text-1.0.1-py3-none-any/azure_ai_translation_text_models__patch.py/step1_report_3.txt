{
  "purpose": "The code appears to serve as a template or placeholder for customizing a generated SDK, specifically for Microsoft Azure SDK in Python.",
  "sources": "The code does not read any input or external data sources; it only imports standard typing and defines an empty list.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or any operations that could lead to data leaks, code execution, or other effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists in this code; it mainly contains function definitions and comments.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs. The code is largely boilerplate or template code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a copyright notice, licensing info, a module docstring, an import statement, an empty public interface list, and a single function 'patch_sdk' with a docstring. The function contains no executable code or logic. There are no data input points, no external connections, or dynamic operations. The code appears to be a safe, intended template for SDK customization without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard template or placeholder code used for SDK customization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code's purpose is to facilitate user-defined modifications without performing any operations itself.",
