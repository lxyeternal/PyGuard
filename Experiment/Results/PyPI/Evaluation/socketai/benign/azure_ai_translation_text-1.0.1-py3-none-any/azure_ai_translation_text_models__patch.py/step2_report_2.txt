  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a minimal, boilerplate template intended for SDK customization.\n- It contains no data processing, input/output, network, or file operations.\n- No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n- The only function `patch_sdk()` is a placeholder with no implementation.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- All reports assign a security risk score of 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- The confidence scores are 1.0, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n**Are the reported issues present in the code?**\n- Yes. The reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward SDK customization template with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports' logic?**\n- No. The reasoning is consistent, and the analysis correctly notes the benign, minimal nature of the code.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**\n- The malware scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- The security risk scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is correct.\n- The confidence scores of 1.0 are justified given the simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks.\n- The code does not process data, read external inputs, or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n- The purpose is clearly documented as a placeholder/template.\n\n### Potential areas for adjustment:\n- The scores are consistent and reasonable.\n- No modifications needed based on the current analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (correct; no malicious code or behavior)\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct; code is straightforward, not obfuscated)\n**Risk score:** 0 (correct; no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The reports are thorough and align with the code's actual content.\n- No assumptions are made beyond what the code demonstrates.\n- The code's purpose as a template justifies the minimal scoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and I agree with their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign SDK customization template with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
