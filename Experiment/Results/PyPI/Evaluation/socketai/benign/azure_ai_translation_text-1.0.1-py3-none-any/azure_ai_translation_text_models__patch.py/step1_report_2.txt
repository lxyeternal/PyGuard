{
  "purpose": "This code provides a template for customizing generated SDK code from Microsoft, allowing users to add customizations via the `patch_sdk()` function.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or perform potentially harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code does not handle any input or perform operations beyond defining a function and a list.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual patterns; it is straightforward, contains licensing comments, and a placeholder function with a docstring. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal, well-structured template for SDK customization. It includes licensing information, imports, a placeholder for public API declarations, and a function `patch_sdk()` intended for user modifications. There are no inputs, outputs, or external dependencies that could be exploited. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not perform any network or file operations, nor does it contain any code that could be leveraged for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template for SDK customization with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is a standard, safe scaffolding piece with no suspicious elements.",
