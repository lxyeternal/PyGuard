  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling HTTP ETag headers and match conditions for a TextTranslationClient, facilitating conditional request logic.",
  "sources": "The functions read the 'etag' parameter and 'match_condition' parameter, which may be provided externally or by calling code.",
  "sinks": "The functions return formatted ETag strings or match conditions; no direct data sink or external effect is present.",
  "flows": "Input 'etag' and 'match_condition' are processed through functions to produce conditional HTTP header values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs standard ETag formatting logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation and formatting of ETag strings based on input conditions, utilizing simple string checks and conditional logic. It adheres to common patterns for HTTP conditional requests. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The functions are safe and serve a utility purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for managing HTTP ETag headers and match conditions. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
