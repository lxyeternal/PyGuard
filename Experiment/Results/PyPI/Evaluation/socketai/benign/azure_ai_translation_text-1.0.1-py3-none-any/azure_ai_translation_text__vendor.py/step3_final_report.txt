  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling HTTP ETag headers and match conditions within an SDK context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'etag' and 'match_condition' for string processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Return formatted strings for HTTP headers based on input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through conditional logic to produce header values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected; straightforward string manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform standard HTTP header formatting for ETag and match conditions, with no external data access, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is simple, clear, and aligns with typical SDK utility patterns. Imports are from legitimate Azure SDK modules, and no malicious or security-compromising operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard utility functions with no security risks, obfuscation, or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
