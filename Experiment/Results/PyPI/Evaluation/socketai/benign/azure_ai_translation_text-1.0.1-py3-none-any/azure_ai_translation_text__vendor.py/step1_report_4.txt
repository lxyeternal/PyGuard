  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for handling etag and match conditions in the context of a text translation client, mainly for internal use.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as etag and match_condition in functions quote_etag, prep_if_match, and prep_if_none_match.",
  "sinks": "Return values of functions, potentially used in HTTP headers for conditional requests.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Function logic -> Return values used in HTTP headers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious control flows are present. The code is straightforward utility logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to process etag strings and match conditions, ensuring proper formatting and handling for HTTP requests. The functions do not perform any network operations, data storage, or suspicious activities. They only manipulate strings based on known conditions. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious data flows are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe, utility-focused implementation for managing HTTP conditional headers related to etags and match conditions. It does not contain malware or security risks, and no anomalies are detected.",
