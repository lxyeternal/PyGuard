  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious code, obfuscation, logical flaws, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides utility functions for handling ETag headers and match conditions, with internal class definitions. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate.**\n- **Analysis:** The functions perform straightforward string manipulations, consistent with standard HTTP header handling. No external data sources or network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on utility functions for ETag and match conditions, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate.**\n- **Analysis:** Functions are simple and safe, performing standard string formatting.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Internal mixin and utility functions for handling ETag headers, with standard imports and no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate.**\n- **Analysis:** The functions are straightforward, with no network or file operations, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment appears accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for ETag and match conditions, with no anomalies or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate.**\n- **Analysis:** The functions are simple, performing string checks and formatting, consistent with standard HTTP practices.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for ETag and match conditions, with no suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — **appropriate.**\n- **Analysis:** The code is standard, with no external data sources or network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment aligns with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified since the code performs benign string manipulations and utility functions.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Consistency:** The scores are consistent across reports.\n- **Potential for Re-evaluation:** If any of these functions were later integrated into a larger context involving untrusted inputs or network activity, the risk scores might need to be revisited. But based solely on this code, the current scores are appropriate.\n\n### My Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard utility module with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and justified. The code is safe, straightforward, and aligns with best practices for handling HTTP headers in an SDK context.",
