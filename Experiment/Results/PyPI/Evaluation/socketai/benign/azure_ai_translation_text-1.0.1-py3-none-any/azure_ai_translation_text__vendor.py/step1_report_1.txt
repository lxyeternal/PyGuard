{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling HTTP ETag headers and match conditions in a text translation client context, as well as internal class definitions and imports related to Azure SDK components.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters such as 'etag' and 'match_condition'. The code reads these inputs when functions are invoked.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the return statements that produce modified etag strings and match condition values, which are likely used in HTTP request headers.",
  "flows": "Input 'etag' and 'match_condition' are processed through functions that normalize or transform them into header-compatible strings for HTTP requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors. The functions perform standard string manipulations related to HTTP headers, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines internal utility functions for quoting and preparing ETag headers based on match conditions. It includes class definitions for internal use, with type hints and imports from Azure SDK. All functions perform straightforward string checks and formatting. No external data sources, untrusted data flows, or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions only manipulate input strings according to standard HTTP header practices. The import statements are from Azure SDK and do not introduce any malicious dependency or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for handling HTTP ETag headers and match conditions within an Azure SDK context. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be well-structured, conventional, and safe.",
