  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for handling ETag headers and match conditions.\n- Source & Sink: Processes 'etag' and 'match_condition' inputs; returns formatted strings.\n- Anomalies: None; straightforward string manipulation.\n- Analysis: Performs standard HTTP header formatting, no external data or malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard utility code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar utility functions for ETag and match conditions.\n- Source & Sink: Inputs processed into HTTP header values.\n- Anomalies: None; standard logic.\n- Analysis: No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, straightforward string handling.\n- Conclusion: Benign utility code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Internal mixin and utility functions for ETag handling.\n- Source & Sink: Inputs from parameters; outputs for HTTP headers.\n- Anomalies: None; standard pattern.\n- Analysis: Simple conditional logic, no network or external data, no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Safe, SDK utility code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9? — The report assigns a high risk score (0.9), but the code is purely string formatting with no security implications. This seems unreasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for ETag and match conditions.\n- Source & Sink: Inputs processed into header values.\n- Anomalies: None; straightforward.\n- Analysis: No malicious activity, no obfuscation, purely string manipulation.\n- Conclusion: Safe utility code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for ETag and match conditions.\n- Source & Sink: Inputs and outputs are standard.\n- Anomalies: None; simple string formatting.\n- Analysis: No external data, network activity, or malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Benign, SDK utility code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** The only anomaly is in Report 3, which assigns a high risk score (0.9) despite the code being standard utility functions with no security implications. This overestimates the potential risk.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is standard, well-understood HTTP header handling logic.\n- No external dependencies, network activity, or data leaks.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code present.\n- The high risk score in Report 3 is unjustified; it should be lowered to 0.\n\n### Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (consistent with the code's nature)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and typical for SDK internal utilities. The only correction needed is to adjust the risk score in Report 3 from 0.9 down to 0.",
