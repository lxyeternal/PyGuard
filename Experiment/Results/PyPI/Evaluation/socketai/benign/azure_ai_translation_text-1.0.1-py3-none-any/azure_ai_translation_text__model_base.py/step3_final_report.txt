{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for JSON serialization/deserialization, handling datetime, bytes, decimal, and models, primarily for SDK data processing.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function parameters, class attributes, regex matches, and external modules like isodate and email.utils.",
  "sinks": "Processes untrusted data into JSON strings, model instances, or internal representations, with exception handling to manage invalid inputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from raw inputs into deserialization functions, then into models or JSON output, without external system or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. Exception handling is broad but standard for such utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard serialization/deserialization practices with extensive error handling, safe data processing, and no signs of malicious activity. It handles untrusted data cautiously, with no network calls, code injection, or obfuscation. The deserialization functions default to returning raw data on errors, which is typical for SDK utilities. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with benign, utility-focused code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK utility module for data serialization/deserialization. No malicious signals, obfuscation, or sabotage are evident. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are appropriate. The code's behavior aligns with safe data handling practices, and no vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are detected.",
