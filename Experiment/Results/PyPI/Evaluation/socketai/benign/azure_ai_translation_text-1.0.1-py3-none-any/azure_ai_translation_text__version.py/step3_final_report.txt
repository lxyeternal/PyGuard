{
  "purpose": "This code serves as package metadata, defining a static version string for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only from static comments and license headers; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects, as the code is purely static.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code simply assigns a string to a variable without dynamic or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, auto-generated metadata with licensing comments and a version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only comments, licensing info, and a static assignment of VERSION = \"1.0.1\". It lacks input/output, data processing, or dynamic behavior. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity are observed. The code is standard boilerplate for package metadata, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, and high confidence in benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static metadata with no malicious or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate and consistent.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
