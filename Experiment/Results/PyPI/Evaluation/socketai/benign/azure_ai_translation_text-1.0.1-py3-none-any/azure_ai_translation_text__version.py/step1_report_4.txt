  "purpose": "This code snippet appears to set a version string and contains licensing and generation comments, likely part of a larger generated module.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings (VERSION) and comments from the file header.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points involving untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative with license headers and a version variable. There are no functions, input/output, or dynamic code execution. This is typical boilerplate code in generated modules and does not exhibit any malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, contains no malicious behavior, and serves as a minimal header or metadata segment in a larger codebase. There is no indication of obfuscation or malicious activity.",
