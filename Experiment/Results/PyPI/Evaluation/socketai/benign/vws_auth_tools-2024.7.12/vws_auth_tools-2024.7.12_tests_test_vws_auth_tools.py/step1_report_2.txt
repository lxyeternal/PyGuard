  "purpose": "Unit tests for authorization tools in the vws_auth_tools module, verifying date formatting and authorization header construction.",
  "sources": "Test inputs for date, content, and authorization parameters; hardcoded string values for keys and headers.",
  "sinks": "None of the test code directly writes to files, network, or external systems; no untrusted data sources are present.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code constructs data for testing functions but does not process external untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Use of hardcoded credentials in tests is standard practice and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of test functions validating date formatting and authorization header generation. It uses fixed test data, including hardcoded keys, which are typical for testing purposes. The tests invoke functions from vws_auth_tools and check expected outputs without any suspicious behavior, external data leaks, or malicious activity. No code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard unit testing code for authorization functions, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It is isolated testing code using fixed, hardcoded data for validation purposes. No supply chain threats or malware indicators are detected.",
