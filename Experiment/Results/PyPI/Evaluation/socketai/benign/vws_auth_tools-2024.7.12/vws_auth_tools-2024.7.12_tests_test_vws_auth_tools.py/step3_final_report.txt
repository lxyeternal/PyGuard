  "purpose": "Unit tests for authorization utilities: date formatting (rfc_1123_date) and authorization header creation (authorization_header).",
  "sources": "Fixed input parameters within test functions, including hardcoded credentials and test data.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows; no network or system calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters used directly in function calls; no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded secrets in test code, which is acceptable in testing environments but should be isolated from production.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward test code verifying date formatting and authorization header generation with static, hardcoded data. No external system calls, network activity, or untrusted data are involved. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The use of hardcoded secrets is typical for tests and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code and the context of testing. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and contains no malware or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward testing code with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The assigned scores are accurate and appropriate, with a very low security risk due to test secrets, which is standard practice.",
