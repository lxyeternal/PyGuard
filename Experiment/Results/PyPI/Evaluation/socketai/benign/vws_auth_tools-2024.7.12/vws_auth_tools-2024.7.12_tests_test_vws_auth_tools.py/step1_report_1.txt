{
  "purpose": "The code contains test functions for authorization tools, specifically testing date formatting and authorization header construction.",
  "sources": "Input data includes fixed strings for keys, method, content, date, and request path; no external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "The primary output is the authorization header string generated by vws_auth_tools.authorization_header(). No external data sinks or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (keys, method, content, etc.) are used to generate authorization headers; no untrusted data flow to sensitive operations or external systems is observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses hardcoded credentials within the test functions, which is typical for testing but could be risky if misused. No malicious or suspicious code, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic, is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of straightforward test functions verifying date formatting and header generation. It relies on fixed inputs and the vws_auth_tools module to produce expected outputs. No dynamic data handling, system modifications, or external calls are evident. The presence of hardcoded credentials is standard for test scenarios but should be kept isolated from production code. There are no signs of malware, obfuscated code, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of unit tests for authorization utilities, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The use of hardcoded secrets in tests is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
