  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple documentation string or placeholder with no executable logic.\n- No input/output, data flows, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The confidence levels are all high (1 or 1.0), which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risks are all zero, which makes sense for such trivial code snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code snippets; they are purely documentation comments or placeholders.\n- **Errors or flaws in the report:** The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Scores:** The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable and justified.\n- **Risk scores > 0.5:** None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score justification:** Since there's no executable code, no malicious behavior is possible; malware=0 is correct.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** No unwarranted assumptions are made; the reports correctly state the benign nature.\n- **Score consistency:** The scores align well with the described content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the nature of the code snippets—simple documentation strings or placeholders—there's no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and no further action or concern is warranted.",
