  "purpose": "Configure Sybil testing framework with specific parsers and patterns for documentation and Python files.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (doctest), third-party Sybil library, and parsers; creation of Sybil object with parser configurations.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only sets up parser configurations and exports a pytest collection function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs standard configuration without suspicious patterns or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and classes to configure the Sybil testing framework for specific file patterns. It initializes a Sybil object with parsers for doctest, Python code blocks, and capture blocks, setting patterns to include '*.rst' and '*.py' files. The final line assigns the pytest collection function from the Sybil object. No untrusted input, data processing, or potentially malicious actions are present. The structure and imports are straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for the Sybil testing framework with no malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks detected. It is safe and intended for testing documentation and Python files.",
