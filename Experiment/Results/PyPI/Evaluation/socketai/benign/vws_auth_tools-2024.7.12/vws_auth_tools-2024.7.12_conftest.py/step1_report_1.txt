  "purpose": "Configure Sybil testing framework with specific parsers and patterns for test collection.",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules: 'sybil', 'sybil.parsers.rest', 'doctest'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; code mainly sets up objects and functions for test collection.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Sybil object creation -> pytest_collect_file assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or suspicious patterns detected. Use of 'doctest' ELLIPSIS option is standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and constructs a Sybil object with specified parsers and patterns for test discovery. It then assigns a pytest collection function. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and intended for testing setup only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup for the Sybil testing framework, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It appears benign and standard for testing configuration.",
