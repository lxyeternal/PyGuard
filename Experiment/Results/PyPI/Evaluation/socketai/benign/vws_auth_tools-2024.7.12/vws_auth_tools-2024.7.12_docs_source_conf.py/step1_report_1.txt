  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation generation.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version retrieval, date functions, and static configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Version parsing appears standard. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up Sphinx documentation configuration with static and derived values, using standard libraries and widely accepted practices. It retrieves version info via importlib.metadata and date info via datetime with UTC timezone. No input handling from untrusted sources, no network activity, and no code execution or data leaks are evident. The code is structured straightforwardly, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs static setup tasks without external dependencies affecting security or privacy.",
