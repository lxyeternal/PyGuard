  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static configuration script for Sphinx documentation.\n- No untrusted input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which seems appropriate given the absence of malicious patterns.\n- The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- The security risk score is 0, aligning with the assessment that there are no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Version retrieval via importlib.metadata.version**\n   - This is a standard, safe way to get package version info.\n   - No issues with hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n   - No indication of malicious intent.\n   - **Risk score justification:** Zero, as it's a benign standard library usage.\n\n2. **Date handling with datetime.datetime.now(tz=datetime.UTC)**\n   - The use of UTC timezone is correct and safe.\n   - No untrusted input involved.\n   - No suspicious behavior.\n   - **Risk score justification:** Zero.\n\n3. **Network retries and ignore list for link checking**\n   - The linkcheck_retries parameter is a standard configuration to improve robustness.\n   - The ignore list includes a URL requiring login, which is appropriate.\n   - No network activity initiated by the script itself; it's just configuration.\n   - **Risk score justification:** Zero.\n\n4. **Extensions and theme options**\n   - All extensions are standard or well-known.\n   - No code execution or external data handling.\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n   - **Risk score justification:** Zero.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a straightforward, static configuration script with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n- The overall security risk is negligible, with a score of 0.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with all the detailed analyses and the nature of the code.",
