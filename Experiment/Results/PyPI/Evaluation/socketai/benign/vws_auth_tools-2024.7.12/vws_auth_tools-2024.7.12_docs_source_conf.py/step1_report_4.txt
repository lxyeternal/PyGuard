  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation generation.",
  "sources": "Reads current date/time, package version information, and file paths.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data outputs or external system modifications.",
  "flows": "Uses current date/time and package version to generate strings; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The script only performs standard configuration tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules to fetch the current year and package version, then sets configuration variables for Sphinx documentation. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are processed. No network calls, system modifications, or sensitive data handling are present. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious logic. It performs typical setup routines for documentation generation with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign configuration file for Sphinx documentation. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It only sets up project metadata and configuration options.",
