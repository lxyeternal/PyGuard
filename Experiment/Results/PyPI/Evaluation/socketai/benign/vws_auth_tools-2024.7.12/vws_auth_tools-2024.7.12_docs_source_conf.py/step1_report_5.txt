  "purpose": "Configure Sphinx documentation for the VWS-Auth-Tools project.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version for obtaining project version, datetime.datetime.now for current year",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; configuration settings are static or derived from trusted sources",
  "flows": "No flow from untrusted input to sensitive functions or data leaks; static data usage and library calls only",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or unusual code behavior; use of standard libraries and static configuration",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file setting project metadata, extensions, themes, and options. It imports 'importlib.metadata' to dynamically fetch version info, and uses 'datetime' to get the current year. No user input, network calls (beyond linkcheck retries), or untrusted data sources are involved. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present. All dependencies are standard or configuration files, with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical configuration script for documentation purposes, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
