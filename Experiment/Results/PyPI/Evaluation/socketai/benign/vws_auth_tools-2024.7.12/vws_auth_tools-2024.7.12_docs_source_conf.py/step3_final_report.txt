  "purpose": "This script configures Sphinx documentation settings, including extensions, theme, version info, and other static parameters.",
  "sources": "Static code elements, importlib.metadata for version, datetime for current date.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, no external system effects, no network activity.",
  "flows": "Static data assignments; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of datetime.UTC which does not exist in standard Python; should be datetime.timezone.utc.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration script for Sphinx, importing standard modules to set project info dynamically. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or execute untrusted code. The version is retrieved via importlib.metadata, which is safe, and the current date is obtained with datetime, although the use of datetime.UTC is incorrect and would cause runtime errors; it should be datetime.timezone.utc. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are accurate. The only minor correction needed is fixing the timezone attribute to prevent runtime errors, but this does not impact security assessment.",
