  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation generation.",
  "sources": "Reads system time, package version info, and static configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Uses system time and package metadata for setting variables; no user input or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. Uses importlib.metadata to get version info in a standard way. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file, setting up project info, extensions, theme options, and some network-related settings for link checking. It employs safe and common practices, with no signs of malicious intent. The only notable external data sources are system time and package version info, both handled securely. No suspicious network connections or data leaks are present. No anomalies or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign Sphinx configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-structured setup for project documentation.",
