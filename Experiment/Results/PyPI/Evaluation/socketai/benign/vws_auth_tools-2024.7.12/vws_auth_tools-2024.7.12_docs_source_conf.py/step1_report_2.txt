  "purpose": "Configure Sphinx documentation build for the project 'VWS-Auth-Tools'.",
  "sources": "Reads project metadata, current year, and version information from package metadata and system date; loads extensions and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network or file writes based on untrusted input; no command execution.",
  "flows": "N/A - configuration code initializes variables and settings without processing untrusted input or executing external commands.",
  "anomalies": "Uses importlib.metadata.version to fetch package version; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up documentation configuration parameters, including extensions, paths, versioning, theme options, and network retries. It dynamically retrieves version info using importlib.metadata and the current year with datetime. No input/output processing, no network connections, and no code execution based on untrusted sources. All code appears standard for a documentation configuration file, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script with no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks. It safely manages project documentation settings without involving untrusted data processing.",
