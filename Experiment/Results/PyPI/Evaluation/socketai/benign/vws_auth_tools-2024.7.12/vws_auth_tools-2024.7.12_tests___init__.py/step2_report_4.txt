  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue presence:** No, the code contains only a docstring comment.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly identifies that there's no executable code, data flow, or suspicious activity.\n   - **Scores:** All zeroes for obfuscated, malware, and security risk are appropriate.\n   - **Justification:** The report's reasoning is sound; no code means no risk.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue presence:** No, only a comment.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** The report accurately notes the absence of code or malicious activity.\n   - **Scores:** Zeroes are justified.\n   - **Justification:** No executable code or suspicious content.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue presence:** No, just a comment.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** The analysis correctly states there's no code or malicious behavior.\n   - **Scores:** Zeroes are appropriate.\n   - **Confidence:** Slightly less than perfect (0.9) but acceptable given the minimal snippet.\n   - **Justification:** No code, no risk.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue presence:** No, only a comment.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly notes the lack of executable content.\n   - **Scores:** Zeroes are justified.\n   - **Justification:** No malicious indicators.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue presence:** No, only a comment.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** The analysis is consistent with the minimal content.\n   - **Scores:** Zeroes are appropriate.\n   - **Justification:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that the provided code snippets are just comments with no executable logic.\n- No source, sink, or flow is present, so no security risks, malware, or obfuscation are evident.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be 0, since there's no code or obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, given the absence of any security concerns.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- If future snippets contain actual code, data flows, or suspicious patterns, these scores should be revisited.\n- For now, all reports are accurate and appropriately scored based on the provided content.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe current evaluations are correct. No changes are necessary. The code snippets are purely comments with no security implications.",
