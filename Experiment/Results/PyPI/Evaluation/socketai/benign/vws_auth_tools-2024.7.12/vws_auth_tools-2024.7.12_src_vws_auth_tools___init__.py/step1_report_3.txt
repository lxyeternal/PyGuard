  "purpose": "Provide authorization headers for Vuforia Web Services API requests using HMAC and MD5 hashing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments: access_key, secret_key, method, content, content_type, date, request_path.",
  "sinks": "Uses cryptographic functions (hmac.new, hashlib.md5), base64 encoding, string formatting for authorization header.",
  "flows": "Input data (keys, request details) -> hashing and encoding processes -> output authorization header string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code; use of insecure MD5 is justified by API requirements, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic operations to generate an authorization header for API requests. It correctly handles various content input types, computes MD5 for request body, creates HMAC signatures, and constructs header strings. No malicious or maliciously misleading code observed. The only potential concern is the use of MD5, but it is explicitly required by the API, not a security flaw. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This module securely generates authorization headers for Vuforia API requests, using appropriate cryptographic practices as per the API specification. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
