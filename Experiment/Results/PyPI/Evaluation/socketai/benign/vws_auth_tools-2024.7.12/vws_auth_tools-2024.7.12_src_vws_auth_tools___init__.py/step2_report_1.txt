  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: correctness, potential security issues, malware indicators, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Helper functions for VWS API authorization, using standard libraries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Generates an authorization header; no external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No unusual code; MD5 usage is noted but justified.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct implementation, no malicious behavior, standard cryptography, with known MD5 compromise acknowledged but mandated by the API.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The use of MD5 is justified and not malicious. The low security risk reflects awareness of MD5's weaknesses but acknowledges API requirements. The overall score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, helper functions for VWS.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses secret keys for signing; potential if secret keys are compromised.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets; MD5 use is documented.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard cryptographic signing; no malicious behavior, just the known MD5 issue.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No signs of malware or obfuscation. The security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar helper functions, with detailed flow description.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Generates an authorization header with sensitive info.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; MD5 justified.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard cryptographic practices, no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly more confident, but still aligns with the facts. No malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Helper functions, standard libraries.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Generates header with sensitive info.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; MD5 justified.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct cryptographic implementation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly lower security risk score is justified given the known MD5 weakness, but it's mandated.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar functions, detailed description.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Sensitive data in headers; cryptographic signing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; MD5 use is mandated.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Proper cryptographic practices, no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. No malicious activity or code behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly elevated (0.1–0.2), reflecting the use of MD5 hashing, which is insecure but mandated by the API.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to MD5, but justified by API requirements. The risk is low, and no vulnerabilities are introduced by the code itself.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of API request signing. The use of MD5, while insecure in general, is mandated by the external API and not an indication of malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the existing reports and the detailed analysis.",
