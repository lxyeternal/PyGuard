  "purpose": "Helper functions for Vuforia Web Services API authorization, including date formatting, content hashing, and signature generation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data such as content (string or bytes), request method, headers (content type, date), and request path.",
  "sinks": "Generates an authorization header string containing the access key and signature; no external data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Content is hashed with MD5, combined with request parameters, signed with HMAC-SHA1, then encoded and assembled into the header.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; use of MD5 is noted but justified by API requirements; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard cryptographic signing for API authentication, correctly handling input types and cryptographic steps. The use of MD5 is mandated by the external API, not a security flaw. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The implementation is straightforward and adheres to documented API specifications. Confidence in the benign nature is high (around 0.9-1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of API request signing. There are no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The use of MD5, while insecure in general, is justified by the API requirements and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall security risk is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the known limitations of MD5 in this context.",
