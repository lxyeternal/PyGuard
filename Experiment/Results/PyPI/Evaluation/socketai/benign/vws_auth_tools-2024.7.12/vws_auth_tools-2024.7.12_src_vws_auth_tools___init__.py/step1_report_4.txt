{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions to generate authorization headers for the Vuforia Web Services (VWS) API, including date formatting, HMAC signing, and header assembly.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as access keys, secret keys, request method, content, content type, date, and request path; uses standard libraries for hashing, encoding, and date formatting.",
  "sinks": "Generates an authorization header string containing sensitive credential information (access key and signature).",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to compute an MD5 hash of the content, which is then signed with HMAC-SHA1 using the secret key; the resulting signature and other components are assembled into an authorization header string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed; standard cryptographic operations are used, with appropriate data handling. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cryptographic and request signing procedures for API authentication. It correctly handles different content input types, computes MD5 hashes for request bodies, and generates HMAC signatures for authorization. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or malicious side effects. Functions rely solely on standard libraries and parameters provided at runtime, following typical API authentication patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of an API authentication helper for Vuforia, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It handles credentials and cryptographic functions properly without hardcoded secrets or malicious logic.",
