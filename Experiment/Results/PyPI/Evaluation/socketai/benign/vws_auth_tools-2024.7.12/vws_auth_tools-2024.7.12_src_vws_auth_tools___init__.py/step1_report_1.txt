  "purpose": "Helper functions for generating authorization headers for the Vuforia Web Services (VWS) API, including date formatting and HMAC-based signature creation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as access_key, secret_key, method, content, date, request_path, and internal hash functions.",
  "sinks": "The returned authorization header string; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct a string to sign, which is then signed with HMAC; the resulting signature is embedded into the authorization header.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated parts. The use of MD5 is noted as insecure but is mandated by the VWS API, not an implementation flaw.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly computes an HMAC signature for API authentication, properly encodes inputs, and constructs the required authorization header. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident. The only notable point is the use of MD5, which is insecure but required by the API, not due to malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are present. The functions perform standard cryptographic signing procedures, with clear and maintainable code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of an API authorization helper for Vuforia Web Services. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It adheres to expected cryptographic practices, with a known exception of MD5 usage, which is justified by external API requirements.",
