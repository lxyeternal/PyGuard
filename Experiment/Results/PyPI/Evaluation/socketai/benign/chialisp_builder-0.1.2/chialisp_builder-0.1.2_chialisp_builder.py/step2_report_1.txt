  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: Build utility for Chialisp, dependency management, external compilation.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.2\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The code performs standard dependency resolution and invokes an external compiler (`clvm_tools_rs.compile_clvm`) with no evident malicious behavior.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or data exfiltration.\n- The low risk score (0.2) seems appropriate.\n\n**Verdict**: No issues. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, confirms standard build process.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.1\n\n**Assessment**:\n- Same reasoning as above; no malicious activity detected.\n- The very low risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict**: Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: Dependency management, conditional compilation.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.1\n\n**Assessment**:\n- No signs of malicious behavior; external compilation is standard.\n- No suspicious code or data handling.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Dependency resolution, compilation.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.2\n\n**Assessment**:\n- Same as previous; no malicious indicators.\n- The external call is standard for build tools.\n\n**Verdict**: Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: Dependency resolution, external compilation.\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.1\n\n**Assessment**:\n- No malicious activity detected.\n- The process is straightforward and safe.\n\n**Verdict**: Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis\n\n- **Malware scores** across all reports are 0, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores** are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk scores** are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the script.\n\n### Final Justification\n\n- The code is a standard build utility for Chialisp files, managing dependencies and invoking an external compiler.\n- No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or data exfiltration observed.\n- The external library `clvm_tools_rs` is used legitimately for compilation.\n- The logic is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 (standard build process with minimal risk)\n\n**Summary**: The reports are consistent, and the scores are reasonable given the code's functionality. No adjustments needed.",
