  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a build utility managing dependencies and invoking an external compiler. No malicious activity is detected.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is sound; the code performs dependency parsing and conditional compilation.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The risk score of 0.2 seems slightly high given the benign nature, but since it involves filesystem operations and external compilation, a small risk margin is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on dependency management and external compilation.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is consistent; no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The risk score is appropriately low.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment aligns well with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on dependency resolution and external compilation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis correctly identifies the code as a standard build script.\n- No signs of malware or malicious intent.\n- The risk score is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar dependency and build management, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The analysis is consistent; no suspicious activity.\n- The risk score reflects the filesystem and external process calls, which are typical for build scripts.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Dependency resolution and compilation, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior detected.\n- The risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, as code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting the filesystem and external process interactions typical of build tools.\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal risk associated with filesystem and external calls, typical for build scripts)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimated Score |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware         | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated      | 0                     |\n| Security Risk   | 0.1 – 0.2             |\n\nThe code appears safe, standard for build utilities, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
