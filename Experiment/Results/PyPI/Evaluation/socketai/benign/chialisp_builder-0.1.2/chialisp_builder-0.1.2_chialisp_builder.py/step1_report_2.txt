{
  "purpose": "This code processes Chialisp source files, identifies included files, and manages dependencies for building compiled output.",
  "sources": "Reads text content of files via Path.read_text(), reads file modification times via Path.stat() and Path.exists(), and reads file names from include statements in source files.",
  "sinks": "Uses Path.unlink() to delete files, and calls external function clvm_tools_rs.compile_clvm() to compile source files, passing file paths and include paths as strings.",
  "flows": "Reads source files -> Parses include statements -> Finds dependencies -> Checks timestamps -> Potentially deletes old files -> Calls compile_clvm with paths",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution; no suspicious hardcoded strings; no unusual code constructs; no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs file parsing, dependency resolution, and conditional compilation based on file timestamps. It carefully handles file paths and includes, and invokes an external compilation function. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or privacy violations are present. The code appears to be a standard build tool for Chialisp files with no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward dependency management and build script for Chialisp source files. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided code. It is safe to use.",
