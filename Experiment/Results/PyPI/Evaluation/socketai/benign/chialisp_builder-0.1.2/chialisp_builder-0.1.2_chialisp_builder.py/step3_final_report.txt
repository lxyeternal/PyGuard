  "purpose": "Build utility for Chialisp files, managing dependencies and invoking external compiler.",
  "sources": "Reading source files, regex parsing of include directives, filesystem checks for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "External call to 'clvm_tools_rs.compile_clvm' for compilation.",
  "flows": "Source files read -> include directives parsed -> dependencies resolved -> external compiler invoked if needed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or data leakage observed. Regex parsing is straightforward; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dependency resolution by parsing include statements via regex, then recursively adds dependencies found in include paths. It checks timestamps to decide whether to recompile, invoking an external Rust-based compiler. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data exfiltration are present. The external library is trusted for compilation, and the logic is standard for build scripts. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting typical filesystem and external process interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build utility with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
