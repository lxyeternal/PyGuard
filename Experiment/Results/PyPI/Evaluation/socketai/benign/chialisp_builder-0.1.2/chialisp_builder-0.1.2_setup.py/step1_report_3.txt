  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration using setuptools for a module named 'chialisp_builder'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls the 'setup' function with a simple configuration specifying a single module. There are no dynamic code executions, input processing, or suspicious constructs. The package configuration appears standard and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It is safe and typical for Python package distribution.",
