{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package, specifying a module named 'chialisp_builder' for installation.",
  "sources": "The source is the call to 'setup()' with the 'py_modules' parameter.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks or data flows leading to potential data leaks or malicious effects in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the code is straightforward package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code, or hidden behaviors. The code is minimal and typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and invokes 'setup()' to configure package installation. It specifies a single module named 'chialisp_builder'. There are no dynamic executions, no data input processing, and no suspicious code constructs. The code appears to be standard boilerplate for Python package distribution without any malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple setup script for packaging a Python module. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a benign and standard configuration file.",
