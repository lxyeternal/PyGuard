  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for a Python package, specifying a single module named 'chialisp_builder'.",
  "sources": "The 'setup' function call and the 'py_modules' argument indicating the module included in the package.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if the module 'chialisp_builder' is malicious, it could execute harmful code when imported or installed, but this code itself does not show such activity.",
  "flows": "Installation process loads 'chialisp_builder' module as specified in 'py_modules'. No explicit data flow or untrusted input handling is present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls it with a configuration that specifies a module named 'chialisp_builder'. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The code's purpose is purely to configure package installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with a single module. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It appears safe based on the provided content.",
