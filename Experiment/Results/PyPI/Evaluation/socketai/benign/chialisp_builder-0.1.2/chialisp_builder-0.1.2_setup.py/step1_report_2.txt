{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package, specifying a single module named 'chialisp_builder' to be included in the package distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'setuptools' library import statement and the 'setup' function call with its parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects, as the code only calls a standard setup function with static arguments.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'py_modules' argument in the 'setup' function to the package build process, with no untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with a static list specifying a module. There are no dynamic inputs, user inputs, or suspicious patterns. No sensitive data, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package, with minimal risk of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply specifies a module for packaging.",
