{
  "purpose": "This code is a minimal Python setup script that specifies a single module 'chialisp_builder' for packaging.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it statically defines the module list in the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the script is static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls it with a static list of modules. It contains no dynamic code, no input handling, and no network or credential operations. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The only minor inconsistency is in one report assigning a security risk of 0.1; given the code's simplicity, this should be adjusted to 0. The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at 0. Since the module 'chialisp_builder' content is unknown, the risk assessment assumes the script itself is safe. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores should reflect that, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
