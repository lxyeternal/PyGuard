{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration using setuptools for a module named 'chialisp_builder'.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; only static import and setup invocation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output occurs; no data leaks or insecure operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observed, as the code solely configures package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for Python packaging; no unusual or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls setup() with a single argument specifying a module named 'chialisp_builder'. This is a common pattern for defining a Python package. No dynamic code, input handling, or suspicious behaviors are present. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or malicious code are evident. The code is straightforward and standard for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It simply declares a single module for packaging.",
