{
  "purpose": "The code tests the behavior of the ChialispBuild dependency builder by copying files, modifying dependency files, and verifying build outputs to ensure correct caching and dependency tracking.",
  "sources": "Reading the current script file (__file__), reading and writing to 'b.clib', and reading the generated 'mod.hex' output file.",
  "sinks": "Reading and writing to local filesystem files; no external data sinks or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "The script copies the entire directory, modifies 'b.clib', invokes the build process 'artifact_f', and reads the output to verify correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs standard file operations and build invocations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for a build process, involving copying files, modifying dependency files, and verifying build outputs. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is detected. The dependency 'b.clib' is modified to test cache invalidation, and the output is checked for expected values. All operations are confined to local filesystem, and the build process appears deterministic. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with this benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign build test script with no malicious or security vulnerabilities. The reported scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are absent, and security risk is minimal. The code's behavior is predictable and safe.",
