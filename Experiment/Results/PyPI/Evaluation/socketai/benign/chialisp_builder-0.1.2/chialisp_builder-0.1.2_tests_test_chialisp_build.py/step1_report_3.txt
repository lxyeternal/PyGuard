{
  "purpose": "The code is a test function that verifies the behavior of the ChialispBuild process, including file copying, building artifacts, and detecting changes in dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the current file directory (__file__), temporary directories and files created with tempfile, and modifications to the 'b.clib' file.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is reading the content of the target build file (mod.hex) and asserting its contents. No other untrusted data outputs or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "The code copies files from the source directory to a temporary directory, modifies 'b.clib', and triggers the build process. Changes in 'b.clib' influence the build output, which is read and validated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious file modifications, or unusual behavior are detected. The code relies on predictable build steps and file operations.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs file operations: copying, writing, and reading files within a temporary directory. It interacts with an external 'ChialispBuild' class to generate build artifacts based on source files. The modifications to 'b.clib' and the subsequent rebuilds suggest a typical dependency update process. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection appears present. All actions are confined to filesystem operations and standard assertions for testing expected behavior.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in this code. It functions as a controlled test for a build process. The code appears safe and benign.",
