  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports consistently identify that the code fetches date data via `api.get_dates_for_course()` and applies overrides to course blocks.\n- They note the use of external API calls, database read-only contexts, and standard override methods.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets are detected.\n- The primary concern, if any, is the potential misuse of dynamic field overrides, but this is standard in such systems.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of Issues in the Code:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The reports do not identify any issues that are not present in the code. They consistently describe the code's purpose and behavior accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n\n- **Any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The reasoning is sound, and the analysis aligns with the code. The reports correctly interpret the purpose and behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Score Review:\n\n- **Security Risk Score (~0.2):**  \n  The reports assign a low but non-zero security risk, citing external API reliance and standard practices. This seems reasonable, as the code interacts with external data sources but does not exhibit risky behavior.\n\n- **Malware Score (0):**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score (0):**  \n  Correct, no obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Confidence (~0.9):**  \n  High confidence, justified by consistent analysis.\n\n### Should any scores be adjusted?\n\n- **Security Risk:**  \n  Given the external API dependency and potential for misconfiguration or API compromise, a slightly higher risk score (e.g., 0.3) could be justified, but 0.2 remains reasonable.\n\n- **Malware:**  \n  0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated:**  \n  0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports suggest any behavior that warrants a higher risk score.\n- The code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The external API is assumed to be controlled and trusted.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency and Validity:\n\n- The scores align with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the assessments:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (or possibly 0.3 if considering external API reliance, but 0.2 is acceptable)\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, legitimate, and well-structured for its purpose.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- No issues or malicious behavior detected.\n- Scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- The code is a standard implementation for date management in course blocks.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No significant changes needed. Continue monitoring API trustworthiness and ensure secure handling of external data, but the current assessment is appropriate.",
