  "purpose": "Provides date lookup and override functionality for course blocks, integrating with external API and database.",
  "sources": "api.get_dates_for_course, read_queries_only context manager, block.get_parent, api.FIELDS_TO_EXTRACT",
  "sinks": "block_structure.override_xblock_field, self._defaults.get/set/delete",
  "flows": "api.get_dates_for_course supplies dates, which are then used in override_xblock_field to modify block data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; usage of dynamic attribute setting is standard; no suspicious data flows observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles data retrieval and setting of course block dates, using external API calls and database read-only context. The only potential concern is the dynamic override of block fields, which is a standard feature but should be monitored in context. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code relies on external APIs and standard block manipulation methods; no obfuscation or unusual patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for date lookup and overrides within a course management system. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on the provided code. The design follows typical patterns for such functionality, with no suspicious anomalies or malware signals.",
