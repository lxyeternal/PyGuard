{
  "purpose": "Provides date lookup and override functionality for course blocks, fetching data from an external API and managing inheritance and defaults.",
  "sources": "api.get_dates_for_course() call, block.get_parent(), block.location, block structure for overrides",
  "sinks": "block_structure.override_xblock_field() method, logging for missing blocks",
  "flows": "External API data fetched in _load_dates() -> stored in _course_dates -> used in _get() and get() methods -> overrides applied via override_xblock_field()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected; exception handling is benign",
  "analysis": "The code fetches course date data via a controlled API, manages inheritance and defaults properly, and applies overrides to course blocks. No malicious patterns, code injection, or data exfiltration observed. Exception handling and logging are standard. External API reliance is minimal and controlled. The code structure is straightforward and aligns with standard practices for such functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure implementation for managing course date overrides. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or high security risk are present. The low risk score (0.2) is justified given external API dependency but does not indicate any threat.",
