{
  "purpose": "Provide date lookup and override support for course blocks, integrating with external APIs and database models.",
  "sources": "API calls to get_dates_for_course, reading from read_queries_only context, accessing api.FIELDS_TO_EXTRACT, and external class methods.",
  "sinks": "Methods that set, delete, or override block fields, particularly in transform() and set()/delete() methods, and external API calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from api.get_dates_for_course (source) into the internal date structures, then into block overrides via transform(), and fallback defaults through get() and default() methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns. Use of try/except for import handling is standard. No dynamic code execution, no network connections or data exfiltration shown.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured and appears to handle date data retrieval, inheritance, and overrides for course blocks. It uses standard logging, context managers, and class design. External API calls fetch date information, which is then stored and retrieved securely within class methods. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are evident. The presence of import fallbacks and safe method calls suggests defensive coding rather than obfuscation or malicious intent. Overall, the code seems aligned with its purpose without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, performing date lookup and override functions with safe practices. No malicious or suspicious activity detected. It relies on external APIs and standard database access with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
