{
  "purpose": "Provides mechanisms for date lookup and override in course blocks, integrating with external API and database.",
  "sources": "api.get_dates_for_course() calls, reading from database via read_queries_only context, reading from block's parent hierarchy.",
  "sinks": "block_structure.override_xblock_field() method, potentially writing data into block structures.",
  "flows": "api.get_dates_for_course() supplies date data (source), which is used in transform() to override fields in block_structure (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except around attribute access; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports. No evident malicious code. No network communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads date information from external API, uses a read-only database context, and overrides block fields accordingly. No malicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft are evident. The handling of dates and fallback defaults appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious obfuscation are present. The only external interaction is with API and database layers presumed safe. The exception handling in transform() is benign, just logging missing blocks. Overall, the code seems legitimate for its purpose, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data retrieval and override mechanism for course block dates. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on analysis. No malware or malicious anomalies are detected.",
