  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code or Security Risks**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is merely a module-level comment and a version string assignment, with no functions, data processing, input/output, or external communication. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. This consistent conclusion across all reports suggests the code is benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as a minimal, metadata-only module with no security concerns. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code.  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct since there's no malicious activity.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of any security issues.\n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk or Malware Scores**  \nSince the code is just a version declaration with a descriptive comment, there's no basis for higher scores. Any elevation would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Claims About Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions**  \nNo claims or assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; all assessments correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**  \nScores are consistent and appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a simple, static module metadata declaration with no executable logic, no data flows, and no suspicious features. There is no indication of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The original reports are accurate and comprehensive. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
