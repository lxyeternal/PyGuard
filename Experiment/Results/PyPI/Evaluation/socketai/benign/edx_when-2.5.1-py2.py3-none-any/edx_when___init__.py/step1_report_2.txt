  "purpose": "Define the version of a module related to course block dates for the LMS",
  "sources": "Assignment of __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "No data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow, as there are no input/output operations",
  "anomalies": "Lack of actual functional code; only a comment and a version string",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a descriptive comment and a version string variable. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic. No suspicious or malicious activity is detectable from such minimal content. The comment indicates the purpose is to serve as a central source for course block dates in an LMS context, but no implementation or logic is present to assess. The version string appears normal, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a placeholder or metadata declaration only.",
