  "purpose": "Define URL patterns for the 'edx_when' Django app, mapping URLs to views.",
  "sources": "Reading Django settings (settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN), importing views, and URL pattern definitions.",
  "sinks": "Re_path pattern construction and view invocation; potential injection if COURSE_ID_PATTERN is untrusted.",
  "flows": "settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN -> re_path URL pattern -> views.CourseDates.as_view()",
  "anomalies": "Uses format() with a value from settings in a URL pattern, which could lead to URL pattern injection if settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN is maliciously modified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django configuration and URL utilities, then defines a URL pattern with a dynamic segment based on settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN. If this setting is not validated or sanitized, it could be manipulated to alter URL routing behavior or introduce malicious patterns. However, since the value is sourced from server configuration (settings), the risk is minimal unless the configuration itself is compromised. The view called, 'CourseDates', is standard and there are no indications of malicious behavior in the imported modules or functions. The code's intent is to create a dynamic URL pattern, which is common in Django apps.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL pattern setup with minimal risk. The primary concern is ensuring that 'settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN' is a safe, validated pattern. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious code injection within this snippet. Overall, it appears safe provided the setting is controlled.",
