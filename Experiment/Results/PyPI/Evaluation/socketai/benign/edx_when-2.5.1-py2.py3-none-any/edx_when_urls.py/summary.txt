  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django URL pattern with a dynamic regex sourced from configuration. No malware or obfuscation is present. The main security consideration is ensuring 'settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN' is validated to prevent regex-related vulnerabilities. The malware score remains 0, obfuscation score 0, and a low to moderate risk score (~0.2-0.3) is appropriate depending on validation practices."
