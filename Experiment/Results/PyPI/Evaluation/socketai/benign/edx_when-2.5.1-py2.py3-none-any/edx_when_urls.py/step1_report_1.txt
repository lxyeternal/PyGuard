  "purpose": "Define URL patterns for the 'edx_when' Django application, specifically mapping a URL pattern to a view.",

  "flows": "settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN -> re_path pattern -> URL resolution -> views.CourseDates",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting with settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN in URL pattern; potential risk if COURSE_ID_PATTERN contains malicious regex, but unlikely if controlled",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django modules and defines URL patterns. It dynamically constructs a regex pattern using a setting value, which could be a vector for regex injection if COURSE_ID_PATTERN is maliciously crafted. The view used is a class-based view. No user input handling is directly shown here. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity. The only concern is the dynamic regex pattern, which depends on configuration; if COURSE_ID_PATTERN is controlled maliciously, it could cause regex DoS or misrouting. Otherwise, standard URL configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django URL configuration with dynamic pattern construction. No malicious behavior or malware is evident. The main concern is the potential misuse of COURSE_ID_PATTERN if improperly configured, but this is unlikely to be malicious by itself.",
