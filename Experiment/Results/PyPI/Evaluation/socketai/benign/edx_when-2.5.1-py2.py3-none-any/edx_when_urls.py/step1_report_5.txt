  "purpose": "Define URL patterns for the 'edx_when' Django app, specifically for course date views.",
  "sources": "settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN used in URL pattern.",
  "sinks": "The re_path pattern uses untrusted data from settings in URL regex.",
  "flows": "The pattern incorporates settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN into URL regex, which may be used in routing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of format() to embed settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN into regex could be unsafe if the setting is unvalidated or maliciously modified; no validation shown.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django settings and views, then defines URL patterns with a regex pattern that includes settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN via str.format(). If this setting contains malicious regex or unvalidated input, it could potentially cause pattern injection or routing issues. The code itself does not perform any network operations or data processing. The reliance on a setting for regex pattern is a potential risk if the setting is user-modifiable or insecurely managed. No other suspicious code or obfuscated elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL configuration with a potential risk stemming from embedding a setting into a regex pattern without validation. This could be exploited if the setting is tampered with, but no malicious behavior or malware is evident.",
