  "purpose": "Define URL patterns for the 'edx_when' Django app, specifically mapping a course dates view.",
  "sources": "The code reads from Django settings (settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN) to generate a URL pattern.",
  "sinks": "The URL pattern may be used in Django routing; no direct untrusted input or data sink evident in the code.",
  "flows": "The pattern incorporates a setting value into a regex pattern used for URL matching, which then directs to a view.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN within a regex pattern is potentially unsafe if the setting is misconfigured; no validation shown. No other anomalies or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django modules and a local views module. It defines a URL pattern that dynamically inserts a setting value into a regex pattern for routing. This approach relies on the correctness and safety of the setting value. No user input is directly used here; the pattern is static except for the setting. If the setting is properly validated and controlled, the risk is minimal. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django URL configuration snippet that dynamically constructs a URL pattern from a setting. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack. The only potential concern is the trustworthiness and validation of the settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN, which is external input in this context.",
