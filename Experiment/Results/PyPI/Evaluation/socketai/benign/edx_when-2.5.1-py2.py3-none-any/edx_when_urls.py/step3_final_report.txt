  "purpose": "Define URL patterns in a Django application, mapping a URL with a dynamic regex pattern based on configuration to a view.",
  "sources": "The code reads the configuration setting 'settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN' to construct a regex pattern for URL matching.",
  "sinks": "The regex pattern constructed from 'settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN' is used by Django's URL resolver to match incoming requests.",
  "flows": "The setting 'settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN' flows into the regex pattern in 're_path', which then influences URL matching and routing to 'views.CourseDates.as_view()'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting with a configuration setting to build a regex pattern; no validation shown for 'COURSE_ID_PATTERN'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django URL configuration that dynamically constructs a regex pattern using a configuration setting. There is no malicious code or obfuscation present. The primary concern is that if 'settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN' is maliciously crafted or improperly validated, it could lead to regex DoS attacks or misrouting. The scores assigned in the reports correctly reflect this low but notable risk. Proper validation of the pattern is recommended to mitigate potential regex injection or catastrophic backtracking. Overall, the code itself is safe, and the risk stems from configuration control rather than code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django URL pattern with a dynamic regex sourced from configuration. No malware or obfuscation is present. The main security consideration is ensuring 'settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN' is validated to prevent regex-related vulnerabilities. The malware score remains 0, obfuscation score 0, and a low to moderate risk score (~0.2-0.3) is appropriate depending on validation practices.",
