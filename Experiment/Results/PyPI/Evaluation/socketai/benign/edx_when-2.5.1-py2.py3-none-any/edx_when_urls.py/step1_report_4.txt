  "purpose": "Define URL patterns for the 'edx_when' Django app, mapping a course-specific URL to a view.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN' for URL pattern matching.",
  "sinks": "URL pattern resolution; no direct data sink that affects security directly.",
  "flows": "The URL pattern incorporates 'settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN' which is used in URL matching; data flows from settings into URL routing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting with 'settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN' in URL regex; potential for misconfiguration if 'COURSE_ID_PATTERN' contains malicious regex patterns, which could affect URL resolution or cause runtime errors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django settings and URL utilities to define URL patterns. It constructs a regex-based URL pattern incorporating 'settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN' for dynamic routing. The pattern uses 're_path' with string formatting, which introduces potential security concerns if the pattern in settings is malicious or malformed, possibly leading to regex injection or denial of service. No user input is directly involved in this code segment, but reliance on settings for regex pattern introduces a risk if the setting is not validated. The code appears standard for Django URL configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No dangerous code execution, data leakage, or malicious backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django URL configuration that dynamically incorporates a pattern from settings. Although it relies on external configuration, there is no evident malicious intent or behavior. The main concern is ensuring 'settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN' is validated to prevent misconfiguration or regex-related issues. Overall, the code appears benign with a low security risk if proper validation is enforced.",
