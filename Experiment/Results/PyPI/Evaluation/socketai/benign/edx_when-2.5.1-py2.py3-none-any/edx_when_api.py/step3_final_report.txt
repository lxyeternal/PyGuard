{
  "purpose": "The code manages course date retrieval and setting, including caching, user overrides, and schedule interactions within an LMS environment.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters, database queries for ContentDate, UserDate, Schedule, and cache retrievals.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur if untrusted data influenced cache keys or database updates, but current usage is safe and parameterized.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through ORM queries and cache mechanisms to output date dictionaries or updates, with no external network calls or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Cache keys are constructed from course and user info, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard course date management functions using Django ORM, caching, and exception handling. No malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Cache keys are constructed from course, user, and schedule data, which is typical. ORM queries are parameterized, avoiding injection. The code handles user overrides and schedule retrieval securely. The security risk is minimal, with no external network activity or dynamic code execution. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting the low threat level. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9+).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation for course date management, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are accurate. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this dependency is very low risk.",
