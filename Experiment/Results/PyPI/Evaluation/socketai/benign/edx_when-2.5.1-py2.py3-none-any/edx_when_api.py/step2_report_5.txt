  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its functions, and the reasoning provided.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is standard for course date management, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** Well-structured, uses ORM safely, cache keys are constructed from course and user info, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk, no malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code performs typical date management functions with no signs of malicious intent. The risk score of 0.2 is reasonable given the potential for misconfiguration but not malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard date handling, no malicious behavior, proper validation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious data flows or code patterns, cache keys are constructed from safe parameters.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard API for course date management, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** Proper use of ORM, cache, validation, no obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No indicators of sabotage or malware.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is valid. The risk score remains low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focused on schedule and override management, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Analysis:** Uses standard Django ORM, cache, and validation. No network activity or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, standard code.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Manages course dates, caching, and overrides, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Analysis:** Uses typical patterns, no obfuscation, no external network calls, no malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code's purpose. The very low risk score of 0.1 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code does not perform any network communication, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, and the code is clear, well-structured, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, mostly 0.2, with one at 0.1. Given the code's purpose and the lack of malicious indicators, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 in all cases is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 in all cases is correct.\n- **Risk:** Considering the code is for course scheduling and date management, with no malicious behaviors, a risk score of 0.1–0.2 is justified. No changes needed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports' assessments are accurate and reasonable. The code is secure, with no signs of malware or obfuscation, and the risk scores reflect a low-security concern.",
