  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation for course date management, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are accurate. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this dependency is very low risk."
