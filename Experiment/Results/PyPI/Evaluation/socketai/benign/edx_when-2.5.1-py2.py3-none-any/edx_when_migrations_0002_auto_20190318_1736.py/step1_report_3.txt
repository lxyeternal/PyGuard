  "purpose": "This code defines Django database schema migrations for the 'edx_when' app, modifying models and fields related to content and user date policies.",
  "sources": "N/A (code is migration definitions, not input/output data processing)",
  "sinks": "N/A (no untrusted data outputs or external system interactions)",
  "flows": "N/A (migration scripts modify database schema without data flow from untrusted sources)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated elements detected. No code injections or malicious patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a Django migration script that alters database models and fields. It removes, adds, and modifies fields related to content and user date policies, including foreign keys, boolean, and character fields. The use of Django's migration framework and standard model field types indicates typical schema management. There are no external network calls, no suspicious dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded credentials or secrets. All changes are schema definitions and follow standard Django practices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Django migration script for database schema updates, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
