{
  "purpose": "This migration script updates the database schema for Django models related to 'edx_when', modifying fields, relationships, and constraints.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the model definitions and migration dependencies; it does not take external input.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data output, network operations, or external system calls.",
  "flows": "The migration operations modify database schema and constraints; no data flow analysis is relevant here.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. All operations are standard Django migration commands.",
  "analysis": "The script includes typical Django migration operations such as removing fields, adding new fields, altering existing fields, and setting unique constraints. It references models and fields with standard data types and no dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or external interactions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The code appears to be a straightforward schema migration for schema evolution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django migration script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It solely modifies database schema as intended, with no suspicious or harmful code detected.",
