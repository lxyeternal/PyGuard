  "purpose": "Utility functions for retrieving user schedules within the edx-when application.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters 'user_id' and 'course_key'. Uses imported modules: 'django.core.exceptions.ObjectDoesNotExist' and 'edx_django_utils.cache.utils.RequestCache'.",
  "sinks": "Uses Schedule model's ORM query 'Schedule.objects.get', potentially exposing database query results. Stores data in cache with 'cache.set'.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'user_id' and 'course_key' are used to generate a cache key and to query the Schedule model. Cache responses can be retrieved and stored using 'RequestCache'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors. The try-except handles missing modules gracefully, which is standard. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for the presence of a Schedule model, which is optional, and uses cache to optimize database access. It performs standard ORM queries with proper exception handling. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or backdoors. The use of cache is straightforward and intended for performance, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for fetching user schedules with caching, containing no malicious intent or security issues. It uses standard patterns for optional model import and caching.",
