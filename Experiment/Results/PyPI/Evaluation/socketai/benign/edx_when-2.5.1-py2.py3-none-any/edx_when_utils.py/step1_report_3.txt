  "purpose": "Utility functions to retrieve user schedule information in a Django-based application.",
  "sources": "Reads user_id and course_key input parameters; imports from Django models and utils.",
  "sinks": "Database query via Schedule.objects.get; cache set operation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> cache key generation -> cache retrieval -> database query -> cache set -> return schedule object.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious data leaks, no unusual code constructs. The code interacts with models and cache in a standard way.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical Django model retrieval with caching. It handles missing models gracefully and uses a request-based cache. No hardcoded secrets, no data exfiltration, and no external network connections are present. The cache key is constructed from user input but does not leak sensitive info; it is a standard pattern. The database access uses parameterized queries implicitly via Django ORM, which mitigates injection risks. Overall, the code appears safe and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for retrieving and caching user schedule data. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It operates as intended with typical Django patterns and proper error handling.",
