  "purpose": "Utility functions to retrieve user schedule information within a Django application, possibly for course management.",
  "sources": "User input: user_id, course_key; External models: Schedule model import; RequestCache for caching responses.",
  "sinks": "Cache store: cache.set; Database query: Schedule.objects.get; Cache retrieval: cache.get_cached_response.",
  "flows": "Input (user_id, course_key) -> cache lookup (if enabled) -> database query if not cached -> cache store (if schedule found) -> return schedule.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. Use of try-except to handle missing models is standard, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data retrieval and caching operations in a Django environment. It imports models with a fallback for ImportError, which is normal. Cache mechanisms are used appropriately to avoid repeated database hits. No malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor code are present. The only minor concern might be the reliance on cache, but this is common in web apps and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for data retrieval with caching. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It performs typical operations for a Django-based caching and data access layer.",
