  "purpose": "Utility functions to retrieve user schedules with caching in a Django environment, handling missing models gracefully.",
  "sources": "Reads user_id and course_key parameters, accesses Schedule model via ORM, uses RequestCache for caching responses.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; data is retrieved and cached locally without external communication or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (user_id, course_key) flow into ORM query; cache key is generated from these parameters; data retrieved from ORM and stored in cache.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard exception handling and caching patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical Django ORM query with caching, handling missing models gracefully. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The caching mechanism is standard, and exception handling is appropriate. No obfuscation or external network activity is detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the use of ORM and local caching, with no evident vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility function for schedule retrieval with caching. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
