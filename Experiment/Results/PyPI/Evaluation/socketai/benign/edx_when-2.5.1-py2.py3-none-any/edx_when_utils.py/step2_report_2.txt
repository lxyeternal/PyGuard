  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a straightforward Django utility for fetching user schedules with caching. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** The low malware and security risk scores are justified. The confidence is high, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard data retrieval with caching, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk (0.2) is acceptable, given the caching and database access. No malware present.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—standard ORM and caching, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, typical Django ORM and cache usage, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate scores.\n- **Verdict:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard data access pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1, obfuscated=0\n- **Assessment:** Zero security risk and malware scores are justified. Perfect confidence aligns with the benign code.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** All reports confirm the code is standard, with no malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** All are zero, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Zero across all reports, appropriate given the straightforward code.\n- **Security risk scores:** Ranging from 0.1 to 0.2, which are reasonable for typical cache/database access code.\n- **Confidence levels:** High, indicating the reviewers are certain about the benign nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and justified.\n- No modifications needed.\n- The code appears safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, typical for cache/database operations)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed reviews, confirming the code's benign nature.",
