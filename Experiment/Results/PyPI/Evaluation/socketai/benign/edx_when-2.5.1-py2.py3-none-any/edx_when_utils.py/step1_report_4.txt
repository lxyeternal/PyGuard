{
  "purpose": "Utility functions to retrieve user schedule data within the edx-when system, utilizing caching and database queries.",
  "sources": "The code reads user_id and course_key parameters as input, and internally accesses the Schedule model and cache data.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the cache store and database, but no direct untrusted data output or external network communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (user_id, course_key) flow into database query logic and cache retrieval, with results stored back into cache.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code relies on standard Django ORM and caching mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for fetching schedule data with caching support. It handles missing models gracefully, avoiding errors if the Schedule model isn't present. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are detected. No external network interactions or sensitive data leaks are evident. The use of cache and ORM appears standard, and no malicious behavior or sabotage signs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical utility function with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It safely manages database queries and caching without exposing sensitive data or enabling harmful actions.",
