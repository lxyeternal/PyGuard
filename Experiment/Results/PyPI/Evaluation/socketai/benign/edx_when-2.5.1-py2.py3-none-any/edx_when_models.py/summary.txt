  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of date management models with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. Validation logic is sound, and external dependencies are presumed legitimate. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate."
