  "purpose": "Define and manage course date policies, content dates, and user-specific date overrides within an educational platform.",
  "sources": "User input via models (user, schedule, course_id), environment variables (not explicitly used here), external utility function get_schedule_for_user.",
  "sinks": "Return values for date calculations, string representations, validation errors.",
  "flows": "Input from user models and schedule data flows into date calculations and validation logic, with outputs as date objects, validation exceptions, or string representations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external communications. Use of validation errors and dynamic date calculations appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual control flows are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Django models related to course scheduling, with methods for calculating and validating dates. The methods rely on external functions and data but do not contain external network calls or data exfiltration. Validation errors are used for data integrity checks. The models do not include any dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious data handling are evident. The only potential concern is the reliance on external utility get_schedule_for_user, but this is a legitimate function call and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of course date policies and user overrides, with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It performs expected operations within a learning management context, with appropriate validation and data handling. Overall, the code is safe and trustworthy.",
