  "purpose": "Manage course date policies, content-specific dates, and user overrides within an edX-like platform, ensuring proper validation and date calculations.",
  "sources": "Input data from user profiles, course content, and date policies; external function get_schedule_for_user for schedule retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if validation errors expose sensitive info; no external sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "User data and content date policies feed into validation and date calculation functions; get_schedule_for_user provides schedule context for relative dates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network calls detected. Validation logic is standard and appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code implements Django models for date policies, content-specific dates, and user overrides with proper validation to prevent conflicting date fields. It uses external utility get_schedule_for_user to retrieve user schedules, which is assumed legitimate. Validation checks ensure logical date sequences, and string representations are standard. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks are present. The reliance on external functions is typical and does not introduce security concerns. The code does not perform any network activity or data exfiltration. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation of date management models with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. Validation logic is sound, and external dependencies are presumed legitimate. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate.",
