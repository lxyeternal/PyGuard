{
  "purpose": "Define REST API views related to course dates, with authentication and permissions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for authentication classes, permissions, and API view base class; class declaration; class docstring.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no external data transmission or dangerous commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; class setup involves standard authentication setup without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward and does not perform any risky operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard authentication and permission classes for a REST API view. The CourseDates class inherits from APIView and sets up authentication classes and permission checks. The class docstring indicates its purpose is to return course dates, but there are no methods or data processing shown. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as data leakage, code injection, or malicious network activity, is evident. The code appears to be a typical setup for a secure API endpoint with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup for a REST API view with authentication, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intentionally designed for secure data access.",
