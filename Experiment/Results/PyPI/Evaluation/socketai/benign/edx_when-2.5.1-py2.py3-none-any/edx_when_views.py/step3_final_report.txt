  "purpose": "Define a REST API endpoint for retrieving course dates with authentication and permissions.",
  "sources": "Imports from edx_rest_framework_extensions.auth.jwt.authentication, rest_framework.authentication, rest_framework.permissions, rest_framework.views",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data, external calls, or sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Imports -> Class definition -> Configuration of authentication and permission classes -> API view setup",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard APIView subclass that sets authentication and permission classes. It contains only a docstring and no data processing, external calls, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Malware scores are appropriately set to 0, and security risk scores are very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern. Confidence levels are high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. No assumptions are unjustified, and scores are consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a REST API view with authentication and permissions. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk present. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or further scrutiny are necessary.",
