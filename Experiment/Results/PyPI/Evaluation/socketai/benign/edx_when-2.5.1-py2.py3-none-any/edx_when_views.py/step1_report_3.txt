{
  "purpose": "Defines REST API views for retrieving course dates with authentication.",
  "sources": "Imports from edx_rest_framework_extensions and rest_framework, likely from external libraries; class definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or output sensitive data are evident.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows are visible in the provided snippet; mainly class setup for API view.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code appears to be a standard API view setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports authentication and permission classes from external libraries and defines a simple APIView class with specified authentication and permission classes. No user input handling, data processing, or untrusted data flows are visible. The class is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The imports are from established libraries, and the class implementation is standard for REST API views.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet appears to be a standard implementation of a REST API endpoint with authentication; there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks in the provided code.",
