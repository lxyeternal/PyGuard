  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Review and Evidence of Issues:**\n   - The code snippet is a minimal, straightforward class definition for a REST API view, importing authentication and permission classes, with no data processing, external calls, or complex logic.\n   - All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks within this snippet.\n   - The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is a standard API view setup with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0.1), reflecting minimal concern due to the code's simplicity.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate. The code appears benign, with no evidence of malicious or dangerous behavior.\n   - The slightly elevated security risk scores (0.1) are reasonable, perhaps reflecting standard caution but not indicating actual vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Justification:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the code's content.\n   - No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they stick to observable facts.\n   - The code is a typical REST API view setup, and no suspicious behavior is inferred.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's content.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — Very low, reflecting standard security considerations but no actual risk.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\nThis code is a benign, standard implementation of an API view with authentication and permissions. No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are evident. The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code analysis.",
