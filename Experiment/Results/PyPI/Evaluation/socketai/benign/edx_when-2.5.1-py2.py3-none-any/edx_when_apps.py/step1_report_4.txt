  "purpose": "Define the Django application configuration for the 'edx_when' app, including URL namespace and plugin settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class attributes and dictionary definitions for configuration purposes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or handle external inputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; configuration is static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs. The code is straightforward Django app configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with static attributes specifying application name, verbose name, and a plugin_app dictionary containing URL configuration settings. All data are hardcoded and serve configuration purposes. There are no dynamic data inputs, external data processing, or suspicious behaviors detected. No potential vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django app configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply sets up configuration parameters for the 'edx_when' application.",
