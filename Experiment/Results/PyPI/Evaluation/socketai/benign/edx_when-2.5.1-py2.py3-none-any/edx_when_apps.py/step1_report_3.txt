  "purpose": "Define the configuration for the edx_when Django application, including URL namespace and plugin settings.",
  "sources": "Reading the class definition and class attributes; no external data sources or input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows within the application setup, but no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code present. The plugin_app dictionary is static and standard for Django plugin configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass for the edx_when app, setting its name and verbose name. It also specifies a static plugin_app configuration with URL routing parameters. The code appears to be straightforward, standard Django configuration without any dynamic code execution, obfuscated elements, or embedded malicious behavior. No external inputs or untrusted data handling is present, and no suspicious network or system actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Django application configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It solely sets up application and plugin parameters without any dangerous code.",
