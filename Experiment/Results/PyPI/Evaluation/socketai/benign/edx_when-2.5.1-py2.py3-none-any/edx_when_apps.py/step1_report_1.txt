  "purpose": "Defines the configuration for a Django application named 'edx_when'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class attributes and dictionaries within the AppConfig class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or user input is present, so no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; code is purely configuration-based.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual language features, or obfuscated code observed. The 'plugin_app' dictionary appears to be standard configuration data.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Django application configuration class with static attributes, including application name, verbose name, and plugin configuration. There are no dynamic code executions, external data reads, or potentially malicious constructs. The 'plugin_app' dictionary specifies URL configuration details, which is typical for Django apps. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's structure and content appear standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Django application configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
