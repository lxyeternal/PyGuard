  "purpose": "Define and configure the Django application 'edx_when' with URL routing information.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points that could be exploited are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only sets configuration variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard Django application configuration; no suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig class with static attributes for application name, verbose name, and a plugin app URL configuration. There are no input handling, dynamic code execution, or external data processing. No anomalies or malicious patterns such as obfuscated code, backdoors, or secret leaks are detected. The configuration seems straightforward and typical for a Django app setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django application configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely sets static configuration parameters for the 'edx_when' app.",
