Validation logic is sound, and external dependencies are presumed legitimate. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate."

The use of 'request.user' for audit purposes is appropriate and does not introduce significant risk.

The main security consideration is ensuring 'settings.COURSE_ID_PATTERN' is validated to prevent regex-related vulnerabilities. The malware score remains 0, obfuscation score 0, and a low to moderate risk score (~0.2-0.3) is appropriate depending on validation practices."
