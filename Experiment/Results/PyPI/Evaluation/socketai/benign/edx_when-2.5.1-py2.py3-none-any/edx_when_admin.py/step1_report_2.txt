{
  "purpose": "Provide Django admin interface configuration for managing ContentDate, DatePolicy, and UserDate models in edx-when.",
  "sources": "Reads data from HTTP requests (request.user), model fields (content_date, user, actor), and search inputs.",
  "sinks": "None indicating data leaks or unsafe operations; no direct output or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "User input (request.user) flows into save_model to set actor; search inputs and form data flow into admin views.",
  "anomalies": "The code straightforwardly configures admin models without obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns. The only notable logic is assigning request.user to obj.actor, which is a standard audit trail practice.",
  "analysis": "The code defines Django admin classes for three models, configuring display, filtering, and search. It safely accesses request data to record user actions. There are no indications of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or external network activity. The save_model method appropriately tracks the user making changes. No anomalies or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a typical Django admin configuration with standard practices for auditing user actions. No malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks identified.",
