  "purpose": "Provide Django admin interface support for models related to date policies and user-specific dates in the edx-when package.",
  "sources": "Django admin registration, request user info in save_model method",
  "sinks": "save_model method assigns request.user to obj.actor, which could potentially expose user info if misused",
  "flows": "User request triggers save_model -> assigns request.user to obj.actor -> saves model",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed. Use of request.user is standard in Django admin for auditing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines admin classes for models ContentDate, DatePolicy, and UserDate, configuring list displays, filters, search fields, and ordering. The save_model method in UserDateAdmin assigns the current user to the actor field for auditing, which is standard practice. No untrusted data handling, external network calls, or suspicious logic detected. All code aligns with typical Django admin patterns, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard Django admin configuration with proper audit logging. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident.",
