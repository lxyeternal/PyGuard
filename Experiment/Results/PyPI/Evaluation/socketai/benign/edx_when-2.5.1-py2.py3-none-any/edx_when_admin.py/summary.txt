  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Django admin setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The use of 'request.user' for audit purposes is appropriate and does not introduce significant risk. All reports correctly assess the code as benign, assigning malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, and low risk scores (~0.1). No modifications to the scores or the assessment are necessary."
