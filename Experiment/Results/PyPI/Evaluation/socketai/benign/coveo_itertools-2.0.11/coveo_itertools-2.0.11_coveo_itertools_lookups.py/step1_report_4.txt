  "purpose": "Utility function to recursively lookup nested keys in a mapping with optional default value.",
  "sources": "The function reads input data from the 'source' parameter, which is a Mapping, and the variable 'keys' provided as positional arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have any evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or external effects. No untrusted data is sent to external systems or environments.",
  "flows": "Input 'source' and 'keys' flow through recursive calls, accessing nested dictionary keys. If a key is missing, it raises a KeyError or returns the default value.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. The use of cast and type ignore suggests a focus on type hints, not obfuscation or malicious intent. The _NOT_SPECIFIED sentinel is standard practice for optional parameters.",
  "analysis": "The function performs a recursive lookup of nested keys within a dictionary-like object. It handles missing keys with an optional default parameter. The code is straightforward and uses standard Python idioms. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. It does not interact with external systems, read environment variables, or perform any unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for nested dictionary key retrieval with proper error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a safe, well-structured utility function.",
