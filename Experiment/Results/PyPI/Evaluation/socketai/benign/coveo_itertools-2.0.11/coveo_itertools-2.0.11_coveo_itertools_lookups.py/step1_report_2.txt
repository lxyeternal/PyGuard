{
  "purpose": "The function performs a recursive lookup of nested keys in a mapping/dictionary structure, with optional default value handling.",
  "sources": "The source data is provided via the 'source' parameter, which is a Mapping. Input keys are provided via *keys arguments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are evident; the code does not output data externally or perform side effects beyond returning a value or raising exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'source' through recursive calls, with keys used to access nested elements. No external output or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a cast with _NOT_SPECIFIED to type T, and handling of default values with cast and ignore, are standard. The recursive approach and exception handling are typical. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a recursive dictionary lookup function with optional default handling. It uses type casting and exception handling to manage missing keys or type errors. No input/output beyond standard return/exception, no environment variables, no network, and no code injection points. The use of cast and ignore is safe here and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The code's purpose is clear and standard, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility function for nested dictionary lookup with optional default values. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward and safe.",
