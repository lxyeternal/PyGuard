{
  "purpose": "The function performs recursive lookup of nested keys in a mapping structure, with optional default return.",
  "sources": "Reads from the 'source' mapping and the 'keys' arguments for nested key access.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no data leaks, network activity, or external interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (source and keys) flow through recursive calls, with potential for exceptions if data types are incompatible.",
  "anomalies": "Use of cast and a generic object cast to a TypeVar with ignore; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. The pattern is typical for nested dict access.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a utility function for nested dictionary key lookups with error handling and optional default. It uses type annotations, cast, and a sentinel for default values. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No external data flows, network connections, or side effects. The only notable aspect is the use of 'cast' and the sentinel for default, which are common in robust dictionary access functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility function for safe nested dictionary lookup with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any external or unsafe operations.",
