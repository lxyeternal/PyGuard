  "purpose": "A utility function to perform recursive dictionary lookups with optional default value.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'source' mapping parameter, specifically dictionary-like structures using source[keys[0]].",
  "sinks": "Returns a value from the mapping or raises an error; no direct sinks for untrusted data or external systems.",
  "flows": "Source (input dictionary) -> function calls -> dictionary key access -> return value or exception.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns. Uses standard type casting and recursion for lookup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a recursive lookup function for nested dictionaries. It uses type casting and ignores type errors with 'type: ignore'. It handles missing keys with optional defaults. No external calls, network activity, or system modifications are present. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected, and no unusual code patterns or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard recursive dictionary lookup utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and performs its intended purpose without security concerns.",
