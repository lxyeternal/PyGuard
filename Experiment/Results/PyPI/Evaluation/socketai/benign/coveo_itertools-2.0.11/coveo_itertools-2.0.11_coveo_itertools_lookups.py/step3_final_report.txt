  "purpose": "Recursive nested dictionary lookup with optional default value handling.",
  "sources": "Dictionary source parameter; keys parameter for nested keys.",
  "sinks": "Potential KeyError if keys are missing and no default is provided.",
  "flows": "Source: source dictionary; keys: sequence of keys; sink: return value or exception.",
  "anomalies": "Use of cast and 'type: ignore' for default sentinel; standard practice, not obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward recursive lookup in a dictionary, handling missing keys with an optional default. It employs standard Python idioms, with no external I/O, network activity, or obfuscation. Error handling is appropriate, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The use of cast and 'type: ignore' are typical for type safety and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility function for nested dictionary access, with no malicious or security concerns.",
