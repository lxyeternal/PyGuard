  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, possibly involving external libraries.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from imported modules, environment variables, or external data files (not explicitly shown in this snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but none are explicitly visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source inputs through processing functions, potentially reaching output or external interfaces, but specific flow paths are not evident here.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are immediately apparent. Usage of third-party libraries is normal; no obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library imports and functions, with no indication of malicious activity. There are no network calls, no eval or exec statements, no suspicious string operations, and no obfuscated constructs. Without additional context or external interactions, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems typical of legitimate utility functions or processing routines.",
