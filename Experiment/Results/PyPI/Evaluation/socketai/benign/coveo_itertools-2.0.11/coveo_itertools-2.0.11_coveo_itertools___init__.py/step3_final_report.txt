{
  "purpose": "The code is minimal, consisting mainly of import statements and module initializations, with no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "sources": "Import statements and module initializations",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication detected",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks due to lack of code",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or suspicious patterns; no obfuscation or malicious indicators",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are minimal or absent, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. For code-present snippets, the low risk reflects minimal concern; for absent code, the zero scores and confidence are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately assess the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements detected. The scoring aligns with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
