  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or functionality using imported modules, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input, environment variables, or possibly external modules and resources. Specific sources are not explicitly detailed due to lack of code visibility.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or system commands if present, but none are explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to processing functions or output destinations, but specific paths cannot be determined without detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are immediately evident. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The provided code was empty or not included; thus, no analysis of specific source-to-sink data flows or anomalies can be performed. As no code was supplied, no malicious behavior or security issues can be identified.",
  "conclusion": "Due to the absence of code, there are no detectable malicious behaviors or security risks. The code appears benign or not present.",
