  "purpose": "Astronomical calculations for converting datetime to Julian date, Greenwich sidereal time, and local sidereal time.",
  "sources": "Input datetime objects, optional 'astropy' library functions, and internal formulas.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; calculations are internal and do not leak data.",
  "flows": "Input datetime -> julian date calculation -> sidereal time computation -> local sidereal time.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code uses standard formulas, handles optional dependencies gracefully, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-known astronomical formulas for time conversions, with optional 'astropy' support. It processes input data safely, with fallback mechanisms that are standard. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The functions perform deterministic calculations based on accepted algorithms, and no external communication or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard astronomical utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores should reflect zero malware, no obfuscation, and a very low security risk.",
