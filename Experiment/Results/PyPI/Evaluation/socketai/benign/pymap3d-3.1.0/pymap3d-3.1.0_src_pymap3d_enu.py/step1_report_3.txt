{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for transforming geographic coordinates between ENU, geodetic, and other coordinate systems, mainly for geospatial and navigation applications.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters such as e, n, u, az, el, srange, lat, lon, h, lat0, lon0, h0, and optional input via numpy array operations.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks are present, but untrusted inputs could influence calculations; notably, numpy array operations and mathematical functions like atan2, sin, cos, which could be manipulated if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e, n, u, az, el, srange, lat, lon, h) flow into mathematical calculations (e.g., enu2ecef, geodetic2ecef, uvw2enu), affecting coordinate transformations. The main flow involves input data -> coordinate calculations -> outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Handling of potential array inputs with conditional modification (setting small values to zero) is present; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are observed. No suspicious behavior or backdoors are evident. The numpy import is optional and used for input validation. No external network calls or hidden code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on coordinate transformations and relies on mathematical functions and well-defined geospatial formulas. Error handling for negative ranges and small values is included. No indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks are found. The only potential concern is input validation via numpy, but this is standard for handling arrays. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate geospatial utility module without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard coordinate transformation functions for geospatial applications. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a clean, purpose-specific utility module.",
