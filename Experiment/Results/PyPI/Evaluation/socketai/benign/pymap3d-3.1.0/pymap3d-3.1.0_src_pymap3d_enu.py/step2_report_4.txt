  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports conclude that the code is a standard, well-structured implementation of geospatial coordinate transformations.\n- They consistently state that there are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscation.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1.0), indicating strong agreement.\n- Malware scores are uniformly 0, and security risks are minimal or zero.\n- The only noted anomalies relate to handling array inputs with numpy, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The functions implement standard formulas for ENU, geodetic, ECEF, azimuth/elevation/range conversions.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation techniques are used.\n- **Data leaks/external communication:** None observed.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Inputs are validated for ranges, and exception handling is appropriate.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The handling of array inputs with numpy (try-except) is standard for geospatial libraries and not suspicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or system modifications are present.\n- The mathematical operations are well-understood and typical for such applications.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is appropriate; code is transparent and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of vulnerabilities, malware, or suspicious activity, a low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of coordinate transformations.\n- No security concerns or malicious activity are evident.\n- The handling of array inputs is typical and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports' assessments)\n\n**Note:** These scores reflect the current analysis. If the code were to be integrated into a larger system, standard security reviews should be performed, but based solely on this code snippet, there are no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, transparent, and performs standard geospatial transformations without any malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores provided in the reports are reasonable and align with the analysis.",
