{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for coordinate transformations involving ENU (East, North, Up), geodetic, and ECEF coordinate systems, mainly for geospatial calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters to functions such as e, n, u, az, el, srange, lat, lon, h, lat0, lon0, h0.",
  "sinks": "The code performs mathematical calculations and returns coordinate tuples; it does not write data to external sources or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through mathematical functions (e.g., trigonometric operations, hypot, atan2) to produce transformed coordinate data, with no external data flow or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains exception handling for import errors and type errors, uses try-except blocks for array operations, and performs input validation on ranges (e.g., slant range). No suspicious or malicious code constructs are evident. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. No obfuscation or hidden code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides clear, standard mathematical coordinate transformation functions using known geospatial formulas. It imports numpy and other modules for calculations but does not include any network operations, file manipulations, or external data exfiltration. Error handling appears appropriate for expected use cases. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data theft, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors. The import of modules and use of mathematical functions are typical for this domain. No anomalies suggest malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of coordinate transformations with no evidence of malicious behavior. It functions as intended for geospatial calculations and does not contain malicious code or security risks.",
