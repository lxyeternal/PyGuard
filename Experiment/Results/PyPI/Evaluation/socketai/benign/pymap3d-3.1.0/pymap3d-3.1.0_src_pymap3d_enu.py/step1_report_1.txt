{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for coordinate transformations involving ENU (East, North, Up), geodetic, ECEF, and other coordinate systems, primarily for geospatial and navigation applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, including coordinates (e, n, u, lat, lon, h, etc.), and also potentially from external libraries (numpy, other modules).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include calculations that may handle untrusted data (e.g., srange, angles). However, no direct data leaks or external network connections are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through mathematical functions (hypot, atan2, sin, cos) to compute transformed coordinates or angles, but there are no external data flows or output leaks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a try-except block that modifies input parameters if they are array-like, which could be unexpected but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are observed. The use of optional numpy import is standard, and no obfuscation techniques are present.",
  "analysis": "The module focuses on coordinate transformations with clearly defined mathematical procedures. The functions handle both scalar and array inputs gracefully. The code performs standard geospatial calculations using established formulas, with no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious intent. The try-except blocks handle input type variations without suspicious behavior. No network calls, system modifications, or suspicious side-effects are evident. The code's structure is straightforward, and the logic aligns with normal geospatial processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of coordinate transformation functions with no malicious or sabotage intent. It performs typical mathematical operations for geospatial calculations, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
