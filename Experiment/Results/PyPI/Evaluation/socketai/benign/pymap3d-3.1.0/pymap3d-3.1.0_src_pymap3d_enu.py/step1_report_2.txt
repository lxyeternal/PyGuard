{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for coordinate transformations between ENU, geodetic, and other coordinate systems, primarily for geospatial and navigation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, including ENU coordinates, azimuth, elevation, slant range, geodetic latitude, longitude, height, and observer location parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations and returns transformed coordinate tuples; no direct data leakage or external system interaction occurs within these functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are processed through mathematical transformations and conversions (sinks) like trigonometric functions, hypot, and coordinate conversions, with some condition checks and data normalization steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code uses standard mathematical functions and libraries. The only notable aspect is the use of try-except for handling array inputs, which is normal. No obfuscated or misleading code found.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-understood mathematical conversions for geospatial data. It uses standard libraries and functions without any signs of malicious behavior. There are no external network calls, data leaks, or system modifications. The only minor concern is the handling of array inputs with numpy, which is typical for such applications. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of coordinate transformation functions with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs calculations relevant to geospatial transformations safely and efficiently.",
