  "purpose": "Provides coordinate transformation functions for geospatial applications, including ENU to geodetic, azimuth/elevation/range conversions, and related transformations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as ENU coordinates, azimuth, elevation, slant range, geodetic coordinates, and observer location data.",
  "sinks": "Mathematical calculations within the functions; no external data leaks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through mathematical formulas to produce transformed coordinates or angles; no external data flow or system interaction occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Uses try-except blocks to handle array inputs, which is standard; no suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard geospatial coordinate transformations using well-known formulas and safe input validation. It handles both scalar and array inputs appropriately. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of numpy is optional and for performance; no external network or file operations are present. The mathematical operations are straightforward and purpose-specific, with proper validation for input ranges. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-specific implementation of geospatial coordinate transformations with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the minimal security risk score reflects the standard nature of the code. Overall, it is safe and appropriate for use in geospatial applications.",
