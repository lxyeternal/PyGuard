{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for converting between different coordinate systems used in geospatial and navigation applications, including ENU, geodetic, ECEF, and azimuth/elevation/range.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as e, n, u, az, el, srange, lat, lon, h, lat0, lon0, h0, and potentially from imported modules or numpy array inputs.",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations and returns coordinate tuples; it does not write to external systems or files. There are no evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through mathematical transformations (e.g., enu2ecef, geodetic2ecef, uvw2enu) and used in trigonometric calculations to produce output coordinates, with no untrusted data flowing into external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code structures, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code employs standard mathematical functions and coordinate transformations. Exception handling appears standard for input validation.",
  "analysis": "The module is a collection of coordinate transformation functions with standard mathematical operations and safe handling of data types. It imports modules conditionally, but no malicious code or obfuscated patterns are present. The functions use well-understood formulas for coordinate conversions. No network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Exception handling is used for type safety and input validation. The code appears clean, purpose-driven, and free of malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of coordinate transformation functions with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs mathematical calculations for geospatial data conversions, with appropriate input validation and no suspicious activity.",
