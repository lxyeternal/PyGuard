  "purpose": "Provides functions for geodesic calculations such as distance, reckoning, and tracking on an ellipsoid using Vincenty's formulas.",
  "sources": "Reads input coordinates, ranges, and azimuths; uses internal mathematical functions and external libraries (numpy, ellipsoid module, mathfun module).",
  "sinks": "Calculates and returns distances, azimuths, and coordinates; no data leaks or external data transmission identified.",
  "flows": "Input coordinates and parameters flow into Vincenty's iterative algorithms for distance and endpoint calculations; outputs are the computed geodesic measurements.",
  "anomalies": "Uses standard mathematical computations; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Contains warnings for antipodal points but no malicious handling. No obfuscated code detected; code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code implements Vincenty's geodesic algorithms for calculating distances, azimuths, and endpoints on an ellipsoid. It carefully handles input validation, numerical stability, and edge cases like poles and antipodal points. There are no signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious commands. External libraries are used for mathematical functions and ellipsoid parameters, which are standard for such calculations. The presence of warnings for antipodal points indicates attention to numerical issues but does not suggest malicious intent. The functions return geometric calculations without any suspicious side-effects or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured implementation of standard geodesic formulas with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behaviors. It performs mathematical computations related to geographic distances and positions securely and transparently.",
