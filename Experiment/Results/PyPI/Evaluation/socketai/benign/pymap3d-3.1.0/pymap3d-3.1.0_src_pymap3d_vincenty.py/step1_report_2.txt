  "purpose": "The code implements Vincenty's algorithms for calculating geodesic distances, azimuths, and points along a given bearing and distance on an ellipsoidal Earth model.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (latitudes, longitudes, distances, azimuths) and performs mathematical calculations using standard mathematical functions and numpy (if available).",
  "sinks": "Returns calculated distances, azimuths, and coordinate points. No untrusted data is written or sent externally within the code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (coordinates, distances, azimuths) are processed through iterative calculations and mathematical functions, resulting in output values such as distances, azimuths, or coordinate lists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling observed. The code is purely mathematical and geographic calculation focused. No external network calls, system modifications, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly implements Vincenty's geodesic algorithms, including convergence checks, antipodal handling, and adjustments for pole errors. It relies on standard mathematical functions and data processing; no suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious data handling is present. All functions process input data to produce geographic calculations with high accuracy. No external system calls, network access, or hidden data leaks are found. The logic is consistent with known geodesic computations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate geographic calculations using Vincenty's algorithms. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies. It is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
