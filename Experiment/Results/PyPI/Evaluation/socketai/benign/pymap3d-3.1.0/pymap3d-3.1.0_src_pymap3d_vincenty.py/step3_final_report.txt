  "purpose": "Implementation of Vincenty's formulas for calculating geodesic distances, azimuths, and point reckoning on an ellipsoid, primarily WGS84.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as latitudes, longitudes, azimuths, and ranges; internal mathematical functions and constants.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network, or file operations; purely computational with mathematical outputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through mathematical functions, convergence loops, and calculations to produce distance, azimuth, or endpoint coordinates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, external communications, or obfuscation. Handles edge cases like poles and antipodal points appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard Vincenty's geodesic algorithms with proper input validation, convergence handling, and numerical stability measures. No signs of malicious behavior, external data leaks, or obfuscation are present. Warnings are for numerical convergence issues, which are standard in such calculations. The functions operate solely on mathematical data, with no external system interactions or secrets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of Vincenty's geodesic algorithms, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to potential misuse of inputs, but no active vulnerabilities are present.",
