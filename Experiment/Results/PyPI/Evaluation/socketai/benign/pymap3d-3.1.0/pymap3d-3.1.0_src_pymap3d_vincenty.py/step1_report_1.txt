  "purpose": "Implement Vincenty's geodesic calculations for distance, forward reckoning, and great circle track generation on an ellipsoid (WGS84 by default).",
  "sources": "Input parameters: latitudes, longitudes, azimuths, ranges; Ellipsoid parameters. Data inputs from function arguments and external modules (e.g., numpy).",
  "sinks": "Calculation outputs: distance, azimuths, final coordinates, track points. No untrusted data writes or external communications detected.",
  "flows": "Inputs are processed to compute geodesic measurements, involving mathematical transformations and iterative convergence. Outputs are derived from these calculations, with no data leakage or network transfer observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or privacy-violating behaviors. Uses standard mathematical functions, with exception handling for numerical stability.",
  "analysis": "The code performs complex mathematical geodesic calculations based on Vincenty's formulas. It vectorizes inputs, handles edge cases at poles and antipodal points, and includes warnings for convergence issues. No signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. All operations are consistent with legitimate geodesic computations. External modules (numpy, math, warnings, logging) are used for numerical processing. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of Vincenty's geodesic algorithms with standard practices for numerical stability and edge cases. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
