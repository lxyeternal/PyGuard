  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code content, logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward module setup, importing functions, defining metadata, and handling optional imports. No external data sources, no data flows, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (minimal, due to standard optional import handling).\n- **Justification:** The low risk score aligns with the benign nature of the code. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are indicated.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a standard package setup with no external data handling or suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Justification:** Consistent with benign package initialization.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, a standard package with optional dependencies, no data leaks, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Justification:** The slight increase in securityRisk (0.1) is justified by the optional import fallback, which is common practice and not malicious.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same pattern—standard module setup, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No issues detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Also a benign module setup, with no external input or malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Justification:** No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely a module setup with imports and metadata.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, the risk scores are appropriately low. The slight risk in Report 3 (0.1) due to optional imports is justified, but overall, the risk is negligible.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are accurate.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to reflect the standard optional import handling, but not a security concern)\n\nThis code is a benign, well-structured Python package module with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
