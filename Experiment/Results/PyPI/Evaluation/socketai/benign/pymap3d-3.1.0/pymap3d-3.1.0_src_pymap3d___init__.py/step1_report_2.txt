{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python module for geodesy and coordinate transformations, providing various functions and class imports related to geospatial calculations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local module files (.aer, .ecef, .ellipsoid, .enu, .ned, .sidereal, .spherical, .timeconv, .azelradec, .eci, .vallado). No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs involving untrusted data. The code mainly imports functions and sets up module exports.",
  "flows": "N/A - The code primarily imports functions and assigns them to __all__ for export. No data flow paths involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. Conditional import handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles module imports, versioning, and conditional import fallbacks for optional modules. There are no functions executing untrusted input, no code injection, and no network activity. The import of functions and classes is static, and the code serves as a library setup without executing malicious code or containing suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python module setup for geospatial coordinate transformations. It contains no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No suspicious data handling or network activity is present.",
