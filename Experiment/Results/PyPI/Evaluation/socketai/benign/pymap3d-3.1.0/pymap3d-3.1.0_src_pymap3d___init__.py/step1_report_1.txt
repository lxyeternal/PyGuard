{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python module for geospatial coordinate transformations and related functions, providing an API similar to MATLAB's Mapping Toolbox.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources or input reads; mainly imports, constants, and definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no points where untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mostly sets up imports and exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code activities, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code consists of standard module setup, imports, and conditional imports.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a module for geospatial computations, importing functions from local files. It defines metadata (__version__) and exports multiple functions via __all__. It also handles optional imports with a try-except block for fallback imports. No external input handling, network operations, or data manipulation that could indicate malicious activity are present. The structure and content align with standard Python package modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured Python package setup for geospatial functions. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The only conditional import is standard practice for optional dependencies and does not raise suspicion.",
