{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python package for coordinate transforms and geodesy functions related to planetary coordinate systems, based on the description and imported modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads input mainly through function calls (imported functions). No direct data input sources like user input, files, or network sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications are evident in this code.",
  "flows": "The code defines functions and imports modules; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this module.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated code. The import fallback for 'vallado' suggests optional imports but not malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a module defining coordinate transformation functions and importing various submodules. It includes a conditional import to handle missing dependencies, which is standard practice. No data is read from external sources, nor are any operations that could leak or exfiltrate data. No malicious code or behavior is present. The code structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured Python package module for geospatial calculations. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected based on the content provided.",
