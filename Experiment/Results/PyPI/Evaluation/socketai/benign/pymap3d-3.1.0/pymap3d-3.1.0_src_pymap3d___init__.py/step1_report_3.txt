{
  "purpose": "The code provides a Python package module for coordinate transformations and geodesy functions related to planetary and Earth coordinates, with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local module files (.aer, .ecef, .ellipsoid, etc.), version declaration, and conditional imports based on import success.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "The code initializes the module by importing various functions and classes; there are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are evident. Conditional import handling appears standard, with fallback imports in case of ImportError.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module metadata, version info, import statements from local files, and conditional imports with fallback logic. All imported modules are part of the same package or related to geodesy functions. There are no signs of network activity, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms. The import statements and module declarations are typical for a Python package, and no malicious behaviors like backdoors, network communications, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python package module for coordinate transformations and geodesy functions. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior, no suspicious data flows, and no malicious code snippets. It is a legitimate package module for scientific computations without security concerns.",
