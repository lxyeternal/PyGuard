{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Python package for coordinate transformations and geodesy functions, including versioning, imports, and conditional dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.aer, .ecef, .ellipsoid, etc.), version string, and optional fallback imports within try-except blocks.",
  "sinks": "No external data input or output, no network activity, no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Import statements and conditional fallback import from 'vallado' module; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Standard fallback import pattern; no suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward package setup with versioning, imports, and optional dependencies. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. The fallback import is a common pattern for optional dependencies and does not introduce security risks. The code is well-structured, readable, and free of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured Python module for geospatial functions. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 in one report is justified by the optional import fallback but does not indicate any real threat.",
