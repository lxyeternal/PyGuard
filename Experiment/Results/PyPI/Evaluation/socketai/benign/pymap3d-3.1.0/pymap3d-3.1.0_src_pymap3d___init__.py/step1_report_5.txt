{
  "purpose": "This module provides coordinate transformation functions and geodesy utilities for planetary coordinate systems, with an emphasis on Earth and related references.",
  "sources": "The code reads package imports, module attributes, and version information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no functions or code sections that process untrusted input or output data externally.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code does not process untrusted data; it primarily imports functions and defines module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. The version string and import handling are standard. The try-except block for optional imports is typical in Python modules.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward Python package initialization file. It defines metadata, imports various coordinate transformation functions, and sets the module's __all__ attribute for public API. The try-except block handles optional imports, which is common for optional dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The code structure and content are consistent with standard Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and functions as a coordinate transformation package without malicious intent. There are no signs of malware, suspicious data flows, or security issues. The overall security risk is negligible.",
