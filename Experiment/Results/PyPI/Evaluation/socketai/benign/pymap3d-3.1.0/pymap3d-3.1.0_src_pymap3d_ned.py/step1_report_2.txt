{
  "purpose": "The code provides coordinate transformation functions between various geospatial coordinate systems, including NED (North, East, Down), ECEF, geodetic, and ENU, primarily for geospatial calculations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters include azimuth, elevation, slant range, geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude, altitude), ECEF coordinates (x, y, z), and observer position data.",
  "targets": "Outputs are transformed coordinate data such as NED coordinates, geodetic positions, and ECEF positions, often used in navigation and geospatial analysis.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed into functions (sources), processed through calls to imported conversion functions, and produce transformed coordinate outputs (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No network activity, file manipulation, or dynamic code execution present. All functions rely on external library calls with clear purposes. No obfuscated or misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of coordinate transformation functions that convert between different geospatial coordinate systems. It imports specific transformation functions from other modules and uses a predefined ellipsoid model. Each function performs mathematical conversions with no indication of malicious intent. The functions handle input validation implicitly via parameter defaults and documented parameter types. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears standard, well-structured, and consistent with typical geospatial computation routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard geospatial coordinate transformations without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain backdoors, data leaks, or network activity. The functions rely on external libraries for core calculations and serve legitimate purposes in geospatial applications.",
