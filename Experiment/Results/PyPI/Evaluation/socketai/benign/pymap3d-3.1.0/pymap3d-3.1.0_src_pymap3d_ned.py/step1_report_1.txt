  "purpose": "The code provides transformations between different coordinate systems used in geospatial and navigation applications, specifically involving North, East, Down (NED) and related coordinate conversions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as azimuth, elevation, range, latitude, longitude, altitude, and ECEF coordinates. It also reads observer location parameters like lat0, lon0, h0.",
  "sinks": "The code returns transformed coordinate tuples such as North, East, Down, geodetic coordinates, and ECEF coordinates. No data is transmitted externally or stored maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are processed through transformation functions that call imported geospatial conversion functions, producing output coordinate data (sinks). Data flows from input parameters through conversion functions to output results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic execution. The code uses well-known geographic transformation functions without misuse. No network communication, file access, or environmental variable use observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of coordinate transformation functions converting between geodetic, ECEF, ENU, and NED coordinate systems. It imports geospatial functions and uses a consistent approach for coordinate conversions. No suspicious code patterns, no data exfiltration, nor malicious behaviors identified. The functions perform standard mathematical transformations common in geospatial applications. All code appears to serve legitimate coordinate transformation purposes. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware behavior are evident. The code is clean, well-structured, and relies on external modules for core computations, reducing suspicion of hidden malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of geospatial coordinate transformation functions with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate library for coordinate conversions in navigation or mapping applications. No indicators of malware, malicious data exfiltration, or security risks are present.",
