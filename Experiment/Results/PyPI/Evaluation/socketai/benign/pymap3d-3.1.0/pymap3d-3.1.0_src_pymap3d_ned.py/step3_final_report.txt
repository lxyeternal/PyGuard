{
  "purpose": "Provides coordinate transformation functions between NED, ECEF, geodetic, ENU, and aer systems for geospatial applications.",
  "sources": "Inputs include azimuth, elevation, slant range, latitude, longitude, altitude, and ECEF coordinates; functions call external modules for core calculations.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are transformed coordinates; no external data transmission or storage observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into transformation functions which invoke external modules; results are returned as coordinate tuples.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geospatial coordinate transformations using trusted external modules. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling are present. The functions serve legitimate purposes in navigation and geospatial computations. External dependencies should be verified for trustworthiness, but the code itself is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of coordinate transformations with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. Scores are consistent with its benign nature, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1).",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
