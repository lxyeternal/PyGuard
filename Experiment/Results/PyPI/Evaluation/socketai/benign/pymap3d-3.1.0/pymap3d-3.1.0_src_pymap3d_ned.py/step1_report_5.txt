{
  "purpose": "The code provides coordinate transformation functions between various geospatial coordinate systems (NED, ENU, ECEF, geodetic) related to navigation and positioning.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as azimuth, elevation, range, latitude, longitude, altitude, and ECEF coordinates. It also uses imported functions from modules like ecef, ellipsoid, and enu.",
  "sinks": "The code returns transformed coordinate data; no sink functions appear to send data externally or perform network operations. No direct data leakage or malicious data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) pass through conversion functions (e.g., aer2enu, enu2ecef), which perform coordinate transformations and output results. There are no untrusted data flows leading to external systems or harmful actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs detected. The code appears to follow standard geospatial transformation practices. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variable names observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of coordinate transformation functions, utilizing existing libraries and mathematical formulas. It defines clear input/output parameters with proper conversions. There are no signs of malicious intent such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All functions serve legitimate geospatial computation purposes. The use of imported functions from other modules does not indicate malicious behavior since they are standard for such operations. No suspicious anomalies or obfuscation patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of coordinate transformations for geospatial data. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It appears safe and solely aimed at coordinate conversion tasks.",
