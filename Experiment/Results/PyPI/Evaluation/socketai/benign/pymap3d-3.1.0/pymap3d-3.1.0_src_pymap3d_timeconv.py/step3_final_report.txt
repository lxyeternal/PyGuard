  "purpose": "Convert strings, datetime objects, or iterable date representations into Python datetime objects.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (strings, datetime objects, list elements, pandas Series/arrays, numpy datetime64 objects)",
  "sinks": "Return of datetime objects or lists thereof; no external data flow or side effects",
  "flows": "Input data is parsed or converted directly within the function, with exception handling for dependencies",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; standard use of libraries; exception handling for missing dependencies",
  "analysis": "The code handles multiple date input types, uses trusted libraries (`dateutil.parser`, numpy, pandas), and includes appropriate exception handling. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The reliance on `dateutil.parser.parse` introduces minimal risk, but this is a common and trusted library. The function performs straightforward conversions without external effects or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured date parsing utility with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores in the reports are consistent and justified.",
