{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import mathematical functions from numpy, and if unavailable, falls back to the math standard library, defining some functions manually if needed.",
  "sources": "Reads module imports from numpy and math, and defines fallback functions if imports fail.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "The fallback to defining functions locally is normal; the import logic is standard. However, the import of math.cbrt as cbrt using 'import math.cbrt as cbrt' is invalid in Python (should be 'from math import cbrt') and might cause an ImportError, which could be exploited or lead to unexpected behavior if not handled properly. Additionally, the code uses try-except to fallback on definitions, which is typical but the way math.cbrt is imported is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports functions from numpy, which is common for numerical computations, and falls back to math for environments without numpy. The fallback functions are straightforward and do not contain malicious code. The attempt to import math.cbrt as cbrt is incorrect syntax and will always raise ImportError, leading to a fallback definition. There are no indications of malicious intent or backdoors. The code's primary purpose is utility and compatibility, with no evident malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for mathematical functions with fallback implementations, with no malicious intent. The only concern is the incorrect import statement for math.cbrt, which is likely an error rather than malicious. Overall, no malware or malicious behavior is evident.",
