{
  "purpose": "This code provides fallback implementations for various mathematical functions, attempting to use NumPy if available, otherwise falling back to the math standard library or custom implementations.",
  "sources": "The code reads the environment during import, attempting to import NumPy or math modules, and defines functions or imports based on availability.",
  "targets": "The functions and variables defined or imported are intended for mathematical calculations; no direct data leakage points are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (such as function arguments) flow into mathematical functions like asin, log, or pow, but no untrusted sources are explicitly integrated or handled within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, with fallback mechanisms that are standard for ensuring compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by attempting to import numerous functions from NumPy. If NumPy is unavailable, it falls back to the math library and defines some functions (linspace, sign, cbrt) manually. These fallbacks are common practices for ensuring cross-environment compatibility. There are no signs of malicious code such as network operations, data exfiltration, code injection, or obfuscated behaviors. The fallback functions are simple and do not perform any suspicious actions. The code's purpose appears to be providing mathematical utilities with robustness across different environments. No external data inputs or outputs are handled, and no sensitive information is accessed or stored.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module designed to ensure availability of mathematical functions in various environments. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks based on the provided analysis.",
