  "purpose": "Provide mathematical functions by importing from numpy if available, otherwise fallback to math standard library implementations.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy or math modules; dynamic import of math.cbrt",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data or external system effects",
  "flows": "Import and fallback definitions do not involve data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard fallback pattern for optional numpy import; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import mathematical functions from numpy for performance or extended functionality. If numpy is not available, it provides fallback implementations from the math library. The fallback for linspace and power is straightforward, and sign function is a simple numeric check. The dynamic import of math.cbrt is performed only if not available, with a fallback implementation. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or covert data leakage. The code appears to be a benign utility module designed for mathematical operations with optional dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign utility for mathematical functions with optional numpy dependency, implementing fallbacks securely. No malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues detected.",
