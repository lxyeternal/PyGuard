{
  "purpose": "Provide mathematical functions, primarily from numpy if available, otherwise fallback to math standard library, for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy (conditional), fallback to math library, and dynamic definition of linspace, power, sign functions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly processes untrusted input or outputs data; imports are static, and functions are basic math operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The fallback functions are standard reimplementations. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. The import fallback and conditional definitions are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import numerous mathematical functions from numpy for efficiency or convenience. If numpy isn't available, it defines fallback functions using math library. It also defines linspace and sign functions when numpy is absent. The fallback functions are standard and do not process external input; they simply implement mathematical operations. No network activity, no data leakage, no hidden backdoors or suspicious behavior. The code appears designed solely for providing math utilities with fallback options, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for math functions with standard fallback mechanisms. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
