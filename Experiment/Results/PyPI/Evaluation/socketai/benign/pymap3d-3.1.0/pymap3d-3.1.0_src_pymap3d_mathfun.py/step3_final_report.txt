{
  "purpose": "Provides mathematical functions from numpy if available, otherwise falls back to math library implementations with custom functions as needed.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy or math modules, and the fallback functions defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; no data leaks or external effects detected.",
  "flows": "The code attempts to import functions from numpy; if unavailable, it uses fallback functions, including a conditional fallback for cbrt.",
  "anomalies": "The line 'import math.cbrt as cbrt' is invalid Python syntax and will always raise an ImportError, leading to fallback. This appears to be a typo or mistake, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to provide math functions with fallback mechanisms. The primary anomaly is the incorrect import syntax for 'math.cbrt', which is a syntax error. This will cause the fallback implementation to be used, but it does not introduce any security risks or malicious behavior. The fallback functions are straightforward, and no network activity, data leakage, or malicious code is present. The code is benign and intended as a utility module. The incorrect import is likely an oversight rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for mathematical functions with a minor syntax error in the import statement. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is negligible.",
