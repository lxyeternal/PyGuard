{
  "purpose": "Provide mathematical functions by importing from numpy if available, otherwise fallback to math standard library implementations.",
  "sources": "Imports from numpy or math modules, dynamic function definitions for fallback implementations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no network or file operations, no command execution.",
  "flows": "N/A - static imports and function definitions with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward fallback logic for mathematical functions, with no hardcoded credentials or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports mathematical functions from numpy for efficiency and broader functionality. If numpy is unavailable, it defines fallback implementations using the math library and custom code. The fallback includes functions like linspace, power, and sign, with their implementations being standard mathematical algorithms. No untrusted input, network operations, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears designed solely for providing mathematical utilities, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for mathematical functions, with fallback implementations when numpy is not available. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
