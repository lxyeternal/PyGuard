{
  "purpose": "This code computes radii of curvature for an ellipsoid, including geocentric, parallel, meridian, and transverse radii, primarily for geospatial and geodetic calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as geodetic latitude (lat), and optionally takes in an Ellipsoid object and degree/radian flags. It also imports functions from other modules.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks or output channels that handle untrusted data; it solely performs mathematical calculations based on provided inputs.",
  "flows": "Inputs like lat and ell parameters flow through trigonometric and mathematical functions to compute the respective radii, with no external data or network interactions involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present. The code consists of standard mathematical computations with clear functions and no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports mathematical functions and a custom Ellipsoid class, defines a default ellipsoid (WGS84), and includes functions to calculate different radii related to an ellipsoid at specified latitudes. Input parameters are validated and converted to radians if necessary. All calculations involve standard mathematical formulas for radii of curvature and geocentric radius. No dynamic code execution, external network interactions, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, performing standard geodetic calculations without any malicious intent or suspicious features. It appears to be a well-structured utility for geospatial computations, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
