{
  "purpose": "The code calculates radii of curvature and geocentric radius for an ellipsoid model, primarily used in geodesy and Earth modeling.",
  "sources": "Inputs are 'geodetic_lat' and 'lat' parameters, which are numeric latitude values; default ellipsoid parameters are derived from WGS84.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; functions return calculated numeric results without side effects.",
  "flows": "Input latitudes are converted to radians if necessary, then used in mathematical calculations involving trigonometric functions and ellipsoid parameters to produce radius values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code performs standard mathematical computations relevant to geodesy; no obfuscated or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports mathematical functions and a custom Ellipsoid class. It defines functions to compute geocentric radius, parallel radius, meridian radius, and transverse radius using established formulas. The parameters include optional degrees input. No user input, external data sources, or network interactions are present. The code appears to be straightforward, with proper use of mathematical operations. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of geodesic radius calculations for an ellipsoid, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate, domain-specific utility module. The overall security risk is minimal.",
