{
  "purpose": "The code calculates radii of curvature for an ellipsoid, such as Earth, based on geodetic latitude, providing functions for geocentric radius, parallel radius, meridian radius, and transverse radius.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters: geodetic latitude ('geodetic_lat', 'lat') and optional ellipsoid parameters ('ell'), with 'deg' indicating degree/radian input/output.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (latitude, ellipsoid object, degree flag) are processed to compute radii, with flow from input through conditional degree conversion to mathematical calculations; no untrusted data flows into insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors, are present. Usage of __future__ import and relative imports suggests modern Python style, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs mathematical calculations for ellipsoid radii based on input parameters, utilizing imported math functions and a predefined ellipsoid object. No external data sources, network operations, or file I/O are present. The functions include typical geometric formulas with straightforward implementations. No malicious patterns, such as dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are detected. The code appears well-structured for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign implementation of ellipsoid radius calculations, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard mathematical procedures for geographic computations without any suspicious behavior.",
