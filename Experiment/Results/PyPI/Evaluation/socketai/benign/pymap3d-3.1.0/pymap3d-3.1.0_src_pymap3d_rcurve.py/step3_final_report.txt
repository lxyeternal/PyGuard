  "purpose": "Compute radii of curvature for an ellipsoid, including geocentric, parallel, meridian, and transverse radii, using standard geodesic formulas.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as geodetic latitude and ellipsoid parameters; functions from mathfun module; Ellipsoid class for ellipsoid parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs purely mathematical calculations without external data or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input latitude (geodetic or degrees) -> conversion to radians if needed -> calculation of radii via formulas -> output radius values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward and uses standard formulas.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard geodesic formulas for radii calculations on an ellipsoid, with input validation for degrees/radians. It relies on well-known mathematical functions and a trusted Ellipsoid class. No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The functions are simple, clear, and correctly implement the formulas. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are detected. The code is a legitimate geodesy utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of geodesic radius calculations. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
