  "purpose": "The code computes various radii of curvature for an ellipsoid (such as Earth) at given latitudes, including geocentric, parallel, meridian, and transverse radii.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters: geodetic latitude, latitude, and optional ellipsoid parameters (via the Ellipsoid object).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the functions perform mathematical calculations without writing to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (lat, ellipsoid object, deg flag) flow through conditional conversions (radians), then into mathematical calculations returning radius values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. Uses standard mathematical functions and straightforward calculations. No hardcoded credentials or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports mathematical functions and a custom Ellipsoid class, then defines functions for calculating different radii based on geodetic latitude. Each function converts degrees to radians if needed and performs standard ellipsoid radius calculations. The calculations follow established formulas from geodesy literature. No external data is fetched, no network operations, no code injection, or other malicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a legitimate mathematical utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard geodesic computation module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It relies on mathematical calculations and an external Ellipsoid class, which appears to be a normal dependency. There are no anomalies, backdoors, or malicious signals detected.",
