{
  "purpose": "Provides coordinate transformations between ECEF, geodetic, ENU, AER, and ECI systems for satellite and observer positioning calculations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as ECEF coordinates, geodetic latitude/longitude/altitude, azimuth, elevation, slant range, and datetime for ECI conversions.",
  "sinks": "Internal mathematical transformations; no external data leaks, network, or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows through functions converting between coordinate systems, utilizing standard formulas and optional dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard geospatial coordinate transformations with clear, well-structured functions. No external network or data exfiltration is present. Optional import handling is standard. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. Exception handling is minimal but appropriate. The code relies on established formulas and external modules typical for scientific libraries. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-implemented set of coordinate transformation functions with no malicious or security concerns. It is safe for use in geospatial applications.",
