{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for converting between different geographic coordinate systems (ECEF, geodetic, ENU, AER, ECI) for satellite tracking and observer-based calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters such as x, y, z coordinates, lat/lon/alt, azimuth, elevation, range, and datetime objects.",
  "sinks": "Performs calculations and returns geographic coordinates, azimuth, elevation, slant range, or ECI coordinates; no direct data leaks or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (coordinates, angles, datetime) flows through transformation functions (ecef2enu, enu2aer, geodetic2enu, aer2ecef, etc.) to produce geographic or inertial coordinate outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments identified. Usage of try-except for optional imports is standard. No obfuscated or misleading code features detected. No network activity or external calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically performs coordinate transformations using well-established formulas for geodesy and satellite tracking. It includes error handling for optional dependencies (like eci module) with appropriate imports. No code segments suggest malicious intent; all functions appear to serve legitimate geographic calculation purposes. There are no signs of data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or stealthy behavior. Usage of external modules is typical, and no suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of coordinate transformation functions related to satellite tracking and geographic calculations. It shows no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code appears safe, with no suspicious patterns or security risks identified.",
