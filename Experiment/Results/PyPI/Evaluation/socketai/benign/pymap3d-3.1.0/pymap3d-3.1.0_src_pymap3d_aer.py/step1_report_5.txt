{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to convert coordinates between various geospatial reference systems (ECEF, geodetic, ENU, AER, ECI) for satellite tracking and observer-based calculations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as x, y, z coordinates, latitude, longitude, altitude, azimuth, elevation, slant range, and time; data derived from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Returns include azimuth, elevation, slant range, geodetic coordinates, ECEF, and ECI coordinates; no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are processed through coordinate transformation functions (sinks), involving intermediate conversions (ecef2enu, enu2aer, geodetic2enu, aer2ecef, etc.), with some data passing through mathematical transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. Conditional import of eci functions with a fallback is standard practice; no obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious behavior identified. No network connections, file I/O, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard coordinate transformation algorithms using well-known geospatial formulas and external libraries. All functions are focused on mathematical conversions relevant to geodesy and satellite tracking. The optional import of eci functions with a try-except block is typical for optional dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leaks, or unauthorized system access. The functions do not handle sensitive data beyond coordinate parameters, and no external communication is performed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of coordinate transformation routines for satellite and geospatial calculations. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or harmful behavior. It is a standard geospatial utility module.",
