{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for transforming between different coordinate systems (ECEF, geodetic, AER, ECI) related to Earth observation and satellite tracking, primarily for calculating azimuth, elevation, and range from observer or target positions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as coordinates (x, y, z), latitude, longitude, altitude, azimuth, elevation, range, and datetime for time-dependent transformations.",
  "sinks": "Return of computed azimuth, elevation, slant range, and converted coordinate tuples; no data leaks or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters into transformation functions; data from source inputs are processed through coordinate conversions and eventually output as tuples of angles and positions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. No signs of code injection, obfuscation, or hidden behavior. The code relies on standard mathematical and geospatial libraries, with optional import handling for eci functions. No network, file, or external system interactions observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of coordinate transformation functions using standard geospatial calculations; no suspicious data handling or external communications are present. The conditional import for eci functions appears intended to handle optional dependencies. The functions perform straightforward mathematical conversions with proper parameter handling. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard geospatial coordinate transformation library without malicious intent. It processes and converts positional data for Earth observation or satellite tracking applications in a typical manner. There are no signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks within this module.",
