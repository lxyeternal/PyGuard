  "purpose": "This module converts between azimuth/elevation and right ascension/declination for astronomical observations.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters: az_deg, el_deg, lat_deg, lon_deg, time, ra_deg, dec_deg",
  "sinks": "Returns converted coordinates: ra_deg, dec_deg, az_deg, el_deg",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used in coordinate transformation functions; no untrusted data is transmitted or stored externally",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected. Usage of try-except to fallback on external functions is standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs coordinate transformations using astropy, with fallbacks to external functions vazel2radec and vradec2azel if astropy is unavailable. The only data sources are function parameters; no external data is fetched or written. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network access, file manipulation, or code injection detected. The try-except blocks handle missing dependencies gracefully. The use of astropy's coordinate transformations appears standard and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard astronomical coordinate conversions with proper fallback mechanisms. No malicious or malicious-like behavior identified. It appears safe, with no signs of supply chain attacks or malicious activity.",
