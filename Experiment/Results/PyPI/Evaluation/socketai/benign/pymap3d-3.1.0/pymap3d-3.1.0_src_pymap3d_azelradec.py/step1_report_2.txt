{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to convert between azimuth/elevation and right ascension/declination coordinates for astronomical observations.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as az_deg, el_deg, ra_deg, dec_deg, lat_deg, lon_deg, time (datetime or str).",
  "sinks": "Returns converted coordinate values; calls external functions vazel2radec and vradec2azel if astropy is not available.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed directly; use of try-except captures NameError to fallback; external functions may receive data but are not visible here.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional fallback to external functions vazel2radec and vradec2azel via NameError exception handling; no other suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides coordinate transformation functions leveraging astropy if available, otherwise relies on external fallback functions. The try-except structure is used solely to handle import failure or NameError, not malicious exceptions. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data leaks are present. The external fallback functions are invoked in case of missing astropy components, which is standard practice. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, implementing standard astronomical coordinate transformations with appropriate fallback mechanisms. No malicious or suspicious activity detected.",
