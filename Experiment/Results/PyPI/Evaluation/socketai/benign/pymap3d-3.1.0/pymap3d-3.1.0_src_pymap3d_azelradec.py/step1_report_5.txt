{
  "purpose": "Convert between azimuth/elevation and right ascension/declination for astronomical observations.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters (azimuth, elevation, RA, Dec, location coordinates, time). Uses imports for datetime, optional astropy, and local modules (timeconv, vallado).",
  "sinks": "Transforms coordinate data using astropy or fallback functions, potentially outputting sky coordinates or angles.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to create EarthLocation and SkyCoord objects, then transformed to or from AltAz/ICRS coordinate frames; data flows from inputs through transformations to outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of astropy modules; fallback functions vazel2radec and vradec2azel are invoked when astropy is not available, suggesting dual pathways. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious string manipulations, or unusual code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs coordinate transformations for astronomical purposes. It conditionally uses astropy libraries if available, otherwise relies on fallback functions. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The fallback functions suggest prior validation or alternative implementations, not malicious intent. The try-except blocks are used for import fallback, not to hide malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard astronomical coordinate conversion module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. Its use of fallback functions is typical for handling missing dependencies and does not indicate malicious sabotage.",
