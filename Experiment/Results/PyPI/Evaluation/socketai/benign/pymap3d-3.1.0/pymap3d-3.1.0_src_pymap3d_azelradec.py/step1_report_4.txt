  "purpose": "This code provides functions to convert between azimuth/elevation and right ascension/declination coordinates for astronomical observations, based on observer location and time.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters: az_deg, el_deg, ra_deg, dec_deg, lat_deg, lon_deg, time. Calls external modules: str2dt, vazel2radec, vradec2azel, and potentially astropy if available.",
  "sinks": "Uses data from input parameters; transforms coordinate objects using astropy or fallback functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> EarthLocation and SkyCoord objects -> coordinate transformation -> output ra/dec or az/el.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of astropy, with fallback to external functions. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. No dynamic code execution or external network requests are present. No suspicious variable names or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard astronomical coordinate transformations utilizing the astropy library, with fallbacks to locally imported functions vazel2radec and vradec2azel if astropy is unavailable. No data leakage, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The only external dependencies are standard astronomical libraries, and no user input is used insecurely. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The fallback functions imply external, potentially open-source, safe functions are used if astropy is missing. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate utility for coordinate transformations, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard astronomical coordinate conversion utility that employs known libraries and fallback functions. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe based on the provided code fragment.",
