  "purpose": "Convert between azimuth/elevation and right ascension/declination for astronomical observations, considering observer location and time.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: az_deg, el_deg, ra_deg, dec_deg, lat_deg, lon_deg, time. Imported modules: __future__, datetime, timeconv, vallado, astropy (conditional).",
  "sinks": "Transformation functions from astropy: SkyCoord.transform_to, AltAz, EarthLocation, Time. External fallback functions: vazel2radec, vradec2azel.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> EarthLocation and SkyCoord objects -> transformation methods (transform_to) -> output angles.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import of astropy modules, fallback to external functions upon ImportError, no explicit security-sensitive operations or code injection points.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard astronomical coordinate transformations using astropy when available, with fallback functions for environments lacking astropy. It imports necessary modules, defines two conversion functions, and handles potential import errors gracefully. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The fallback functions (vazel2radec and vradec2azel) are external and not provided here, so their behavior cannot be fully assessed, but their usage appears to be a standard fallback mechanism. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard astronomical coordinate conversion module with proper error handling and fallback strategies. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks within this code segment.",
