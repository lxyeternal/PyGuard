{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to convert between azimuth/elevation and right ascension/declination for astronomical observations.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as azimuth, elevation, RA, Dec, observer latitude, longitude, and observation time.",
  "sinks": "Transforms data via astropy or fallback functions; no data leaks or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to create EarthLocation and SkyCoord objects, which are transformed to obtain the output coordinates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Fallback functions are external and invoked only if astropy is unavailable.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard astronomical coordinate transformations using astropy when available, with fallback functions for missing dependencies. It handles dependencies gracefully and does not include malicious or suspicious behavior. No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The fallback functions are external and their security cannot be verified here, but their invocation is standard. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and consistent with best practices for such transformations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of coordinate conversions with appropriate fallback mechanisms. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The fallback functions are external but assumed safe. The overall security risk is negligible.",
