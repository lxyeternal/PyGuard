  "purpose": "Provides encoding and decoding functions for base62 representation of integers and byte arrays.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'n', 'barray', and 'encoded' in functions encode, encodebytes, decode, and decodebytes.",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions process input data; no external system interactions or data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Input data is validated, processed through encoding/decoding functions, and returned as strings or integers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Functions perform standard encoding/decoding tasks. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure practices detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard base62 encoding and decoding routines, with input validation via _check_type. The functions handle bytes and string inputs, process leading zeros, and raise errors on invalid characters. There are no network operations, file manipulations, or system commands. The code appears clean, purpose-specific, and free from obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured implementation of base62 encoding/decoding with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely as a utility module for data encoding.",
