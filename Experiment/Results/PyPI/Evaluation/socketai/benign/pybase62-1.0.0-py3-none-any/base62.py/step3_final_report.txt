  "purpose": "Standard base62 encoding and decoding utility functions for integers and byte arrays.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as integers, byte arrays, and encoded strings; type checks ensure validation.",
  "sinks": "Decoding functions process encoded strings; no external system interactions or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through encode/decode functions, with validation and conversion steps; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; handling of leading zeros is standard; no obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward base62 encoding/decoding with proper input validation, handling of leading zeros, and no external dependencies. All functions perform as intended, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The input validation and error handling are appropriate, and the code structure is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of base62 encoding/decoding functions. No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and correctness.",
