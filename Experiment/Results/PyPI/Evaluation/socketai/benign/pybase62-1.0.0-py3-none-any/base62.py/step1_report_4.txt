{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for encoding and decoding integers and byte arrays using base62 encoding scheme.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for encode, encodebytes, decode, and decodebytes functions (integers, byte arrays, strings).",
  "sinks": "Returned encoded strings, decoded integers, and byte arrays.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into encode/encodebytes functions and is processed; output flows as encoded strings or decoded values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns detected. The functions perform standard encoding/decoding without external calls or side effects. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variables observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements base62 encoding/decoding with straightforward logic. It manages leading zeros in byte arrays and validates input types. No external network connections, file operations, or environment variable usage are present. Functions perform pure transformations of data. The charset selection allows for different character sets but does not introduce security issues. No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of base62 encoding/decoding functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates as expected for encoding utilities without side effects.",
