{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for encoding and decoding integers and byte arrays into base62 strings, primarily for data encoding purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions: integers, byte arrays, and encoded strings; data derived from these inputs during encoding/decoding processes.",
  "sinks": "Return values of encode, encodebytes, decode, decodebytes functions; they produce encoded/decoded data but do not send or store data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into encoding functions, which convert them to strings or bytes; decoded data flows back to binary forms. No external data transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code segments identified. The code strictly performs encoding/decoding operations with input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of functions to encode integers and bytes to base62 strings and decode them back. It includes input validation and handling of leading zeros, which is standard for base62 encoding. No external system interactions, network communications, or file operations are present. The functions do not execute untrusted code, manipulate environment variables, or contain obfuscated code. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of base62 encoding/decoding with appropriate input validation. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign utility module for data encoding purposes.",
