{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for encoding and decoding data between integers, bytes, and base62 strings.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters: integers, byte arrays, and strings.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed internally; no output or external data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through encoding and decoding functions, but no untrusted external data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward and performs standard base62 encoding/decoding.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard base62 encoding/decoding functions with handling for leading zeros and error checking for invalid characters. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected. The functions operate solely on provided input data with no external dependencies or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical implementation of base62 encoding/decoding without malicious intent or security risks. There are no signs of malware or suspicious behavior. It is safe for use from a security perspective.",
