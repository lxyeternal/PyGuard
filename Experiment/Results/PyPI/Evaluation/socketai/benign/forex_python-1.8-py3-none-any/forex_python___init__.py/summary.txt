  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent with the absence of code and malicious activity. Malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. Confidence and purpose scores could be adjusted downward to reflect the lack of analysis, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, no evidence of malicious behavior or security risk is present."
