  "analysis": "Absence of code prevents source, sink, or flow identification. All reports correctly acknowledge the lack of code, leading to no detectable malicious behavior or obfuscation. Scores for malware and obfuscation are appropriately zero. Confidence levels are low, reflecting the inability to analyze code. Slightly higher purpose and confidence scores in some reports suggest assumptions of benign intent despite no code being present; these could be conservatively lowered.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent with the absence of code and malicious activity. Malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. Confidence and purpose scores could be adjusted downward to reflect the lack of analysis, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, no evidence of malicious behavior or security risk is present.",
