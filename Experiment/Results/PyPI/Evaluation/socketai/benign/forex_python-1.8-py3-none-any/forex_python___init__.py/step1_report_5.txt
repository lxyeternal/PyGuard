{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a typical Python script, potentially for data processing or utility purposes, with no explicit indication of malicious intent based on the visible content.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, file operations, environment variables, or network sources (if present). However, specific data sources are not visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, file writes, network transmissions, or subprocess calls. The code does not clearly show untrusted data reaching critical sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables, files) to sinks (outputs, network, files). No explicit flow is identifiable without more context.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are evident. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review indicates the code uses common Python constructs without obfuscation. No suspicious imports, dynamic code execution, or network activity are apparent. The absence of visible malicious patterns suggests the code's behavior aligns with normal operations. Since the code is incomplete or generic, confidence in detecting malicious behavior is limited.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but the limited visibility prevents a definitive assessment. No suspicious activity or malware signatures are detected.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
