  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on patterns like dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, and suspicious control flow.",
  "sources": "Use of 'eval', 'exec', environment variables, hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, obfuscation patterns, and input handling functions.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file I/O, environment variables, dynamic code execution points, and data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or environment variables flow into 'eval'/'exec' or other dynamic execution points, potentially leading to malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'eval'/'exec' with untrusted data, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, suspicious control flow, and handling of environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code analysis across reports indicates that benign code lacks suspicious patterns, with low malware and obfuscation scores. Reports highlighting 'eval'/'exec' and obfuscation patterns suggest higher malicious potential. The scores in reports 2 and 4 are justified by these patterns, with report 4's malware score warranting an increase due to the presence of 'eval' with untrusted input and obfuscation. The overall suspicion is moderate, with a conservative estimate of malware around 0.4, obfuscated around 0.6, and security risk around 0.5.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent and cautious, correctly identifying benign and suspicious patterns. The primary adjustment needed is increasing the malware score for report 4 from 0.2 to approximately 0.4 to better reflect the risks posed by 'eval' and obfuscation. The overall risk remains moderate, emphasizing caution due to dynamic code execution and obfuscation patterns.",
