  "purpose": "This code provides functionality to fetch and convert currency exchange rates using an external API, and to retrieve currency metadata from a local JSON file.",
  "sources": "The code reads currency data from a local JSON file located at 'raw_data/currencies.json' and fetches data from an external API endpoint 'https://theforexapi.com/api/' via HTTP GET requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external API endpoints, parsing of JSON responses, file reading for local currency data, and data returned for currency conversion and metadata retrieval.",
  "flows": "Input data such as currency codes, symbols, and amounts are read from user functions. These inputs influence API requests (source) and local JSON file reading (source). Responses from API or local files are parsed and used for calculations or data retrieval (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a hardcoded URL for the external API; no evident hardcoded credentials or secrets. The JSON file path is constructed dynamically. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present. The code uses requests without SSL validation or other network security measures, but this is typical for such use cases. No suspicious or malicious functions are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for handling currency rates and currency metadata, with methods that fetch data from a remote API and local JSON files. The API URL is static and not suspicious. The JSON file is read from the local filesystem, which appears standard. There are no hardcoded credentials or secrets. The network requests are straightforward, and no data exfiltration or malicious network activity is evident. Exception handling is present for common failure modes, but no malicious behavior such as data theft or command execution is visible. The code is primarily for data retrieval and conversion, with no evident malicious payloads or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard currency conversion utility with local data caching and external API requests. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are detected. The usage of external API and local JSON files is typical and does not present security concerns based on the provided code.",
