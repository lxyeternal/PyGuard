  "purpose": "This code provides functionality to fetch and convert currency exchange rates using an external API, and manage currency codes and symbols from a local JSON file.",
  "sources": "Requests to the external API at https://theforexapi.com, file reads from 'raw_data/currencies.json' for currency data.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted API responses that are parsed into JSON, usage of response.text and response.json() for decoding, reading from local JSON file.",
  "flows": "API responses are decoded and used to retrieve exchange rates or currency info, potentially involving data returned from untrusted sources being parsed and used.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Usage of environment variables is not present. No unusual code structures or obfuscation. The API URL and local file reading are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with a public currency API and local JSON data for currency information. It does not contain any obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious data handling. The API responses are parsed normally, with error handling for failed requests or missing rates. The local JSON file is loaded only once and used for lookup operations. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity is present. The code's primary focus is currency data retrieval and conversion, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform legitimate currency data processing tasks without any malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It securely reads data from a public API and local files, with appropriate error handling. Overall, it seems safe based on the provided source.",
