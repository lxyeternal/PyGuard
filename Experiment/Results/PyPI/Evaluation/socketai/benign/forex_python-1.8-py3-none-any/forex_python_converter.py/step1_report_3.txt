  "purpose": "This code provides functionality to retrieve and convert currency exchange rates using an external API, along with currency metadata such as symbols and names from a local JSON file.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include: (1) User-provided currency codes, (2) Date objects, (3) JSON files containing currency metadata, (4) responses from the external forex API via HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include: (1) External API responses (requests.get), (2) Reading local JSON files, (3) Returning data through API calls, (4) Calculations involving rates and amounts, (5) JSON decoding and data retrieval.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs (API responses, user parameters) through decoding and processing functions, potentially involving external requests (requests.get), into internal variables and return values. Data retrieved from local JSON files is used for metadata lookups.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. The code relies on external API without API keys or authentication, which is normal. No obfuscated code or unusual code structures. Exception handling appears standard. No backdoors, code injection, or malicious data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily interacts with external services via HTTP GET requests, processes JSON data, and reads local JSON files for currency metadata. It uses standard Python libraries with no signs of obfuscation or malicious manipulation. The API URL is hardcoded but does not include sensitive credentials. The local JSON file access is straightforward, with no indications of malicious content or behavior. Data is processed and returned in a standard manner, with error handling for common issues like unavailable rates or data mismatch. No suspicious network activity or privacy leaks are apparent from static code review. The external requests are made to a public API, and the data handling is safe assuming the API is legitimate. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system harm, nor any behavior that could be malicious based on this static review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical currency conversion utility relying on external API data and local JSON files. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. Its primary functions are to fetch, decode, and process currency data securely, with standard exception handling. No malware or malicious intent is detected.",
