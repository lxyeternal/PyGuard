  "purpose": "The code provides currency exchange rates and conversion functionalities by fetching data from an external API and local JSON files, with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "External API at https://theforexapi.com/api/ and local JSON files for currency data.",
  "sinks": "API responses and local JSON data reads used for rate calculations and currency info retrieval.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external API responses and local JSON into JSON parsing and rate calculations, with no untrusted data manipulation beyond standard API requests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API requests and JSON parsing for currency data. It includes error handling for network issues and data availability. No signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. The code is straightforward, with clear structure and no obfuscation. External API URL is publicly accessible and used without credentials. Local JSON data is loaded once and used for lookups, with no suspicious content. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, reflecting operational dependencies rather than security threats.",
