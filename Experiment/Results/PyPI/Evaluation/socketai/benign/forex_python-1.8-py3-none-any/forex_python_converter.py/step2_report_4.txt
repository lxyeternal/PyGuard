  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code interacts with a public API and local JSON data for currency info. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The API responses are parsed normally, with error handling. No signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, operational risk)\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is straightforward, with no evidence of malicious intent. The low risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard API interactions, local JSON data, and no malicious code. The only concern is potential operational risks from unvalidated external data, not malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, operational risk)\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No malicious activity is indicated.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code fetches and processes currency data from a public API and local JSON files, with no signs of malicious behavior. No obfuscation or backdoors.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (appropriate)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is solid. The code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern: external API calls, local JSON reads, no suspicious code or secrets. No malicious activity or backdoors.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The evaluation is consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, standard data fetching and processing, no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no backdoors. The code uses 'simplejson' but that alone isn't suspicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion aligns with the static analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the code clarity and lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Uniformly 0.2, representing low operational risk due to reliance on external API and local data, but no malicious activity.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n\n- The code interacts with a public API without credentials, which is typical.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.\n- Local JSON data is read securely, and no hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The API URL is hardcoded but appears legitimate.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (appropriate, given the low operational risk)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent with the static code analysis.** There are no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation, and the low risk score reflects the operational considerations rather than security threats.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Estimated Score |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                      |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                      |\n| Risk           | 0.2                    |\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and reasoning in the reports.",
