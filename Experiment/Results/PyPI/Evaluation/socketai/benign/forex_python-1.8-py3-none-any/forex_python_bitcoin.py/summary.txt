  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Bitcoin API client with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Minor semantic issues (Unicode symbol) and robustness concerns (lack of network error handling) do not elevate security risk. Overall, it is safe for use with a very low security risk score."
