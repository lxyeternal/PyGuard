  "purpose": "A Python class for fetching Bitcoin prices and performing conversions using CoinDesk API endpoints.",
  "sources": "API responses from requests.get() calls to CoinDesk endpoints; response.json() and _decode_rates() parsing JSON data.",
  "sinks": "Data used in calculations for price conversions; no external data leaks or untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "API response data flows into conversion functions, where prices are extracted and used for arithmetic operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'json.loads(response.text, use_decimal=True)' which relies on 'simplejson' extension; Unicode symbol '\\u0E3F' (Thai Baht) instead of Bitcoin symbol; lack of explicit network error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper for CoinDesk Bitcoin price data, performing conversions and historical data retrieval. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The use of 'use_decimal' parameter in 'json.loads' suggests reliance on 'simplejson' with extended features, which is acceptable if verified. The Unicode symbol for Bitcoin is incorrect but semantically minor. The code lacks explicit exception handling for network errors, which could be improved but does not introduce security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Bitcoin API client with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Minor semantic issues (Unicode symbol) and robustness concerns (lack of network error handling) do not elevate security risk. Overall, it is safe for use with a very low security risk score.",
