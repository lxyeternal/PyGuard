      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent and cautious, correctly identifying benign and suspicious patterns. The primary adjustment needed is increasing the malware score for report 4 from 0.2 to approximately 0.4 to better reflect the risks posed by 'eval' and obfuscation. The overall risk remains moderate, emphasizing caution due to dynamic code execution and obfuscation patterns."

      "confidence": 0.2,
      "conclusion": "All reports are consistent with the absence of code and malicious activity. Malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. Confidence and purpose scores could be adjusted downward to reflect the lack of analysis, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, no evidence of malicious behavior or security risk is present."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured Bitcoin API client with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Minor semantic issues (Unicode symbol) and robustness concerns (lack of network error handling) do not elevate security risk. Overall, it is safe for use with a very low security risk score."
