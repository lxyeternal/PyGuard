{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for the 'ciphey' Python package, specifying dependencies, metadata, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, dependencies, and long_description string containing extensive HTML/Markdown content.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data fetching; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; all data is predefined within the script.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The long_description is extensive but benign documentation content.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py file with no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The large HTML/Markdown in 'long_description' is typical for package descriptions and does not pose security risks. The dependency versions are constrained, and no suspicious dependencies or code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup configuration for the 'ciphey' package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor securityRisk score of 0.1 in the last report is an overestimate; the actual risk is negligible.",
