  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and whether any adjustments are warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup.py for 'ciphey' with no malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies. The long_description is extensive but benign HTML/Markdown content.\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — consistent; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — accurate; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — justified; no security risks.\n\n**Conclusion:** Fully accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; standard setup.py with static data, no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, risk 0.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical setup.py with static configuration, no suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, risk 0.0 — justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** Correct. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard setup script, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, risk 0.0 — appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** Accurate. No modifications required.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar setup script; no malicious code, obfuscation, or anomalies. The only notable point is a **securityRisk** score of **0.1**, which is very low.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.0, securityRisk 0.1.\n\n**Analysis of the securityRisk score:**  \nGiven the content, this is a standard setup script with no suspicious activity. The slight non-zero value (0.1) might reflect a conservative stance, perhaps due to the extensive HTML content or the potential for hidden data in long_description, but nothing in the code indicates actual risk.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- The securityRisk score should be **0.0**, as there are no signs of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.  \n- The low score (0.1) is probably overly cautious and should be adjusted.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Final Estimates**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0.0, as there's no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0.0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk/malware/obfuscated scores:** All should be **0.0**; no evidence suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured setup.py for a Python package, with no dynamic code, external data fetching, or suspicious patterns.\n- The extensive HTML in 'long_description' is typical for detailed package descriptions.\n- No signs of backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious activity are present.\n- The only minor point is the 'securityRisk' score in report 5, which should be **0.0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my own estimates:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0.0            |\n| Obfuscated      | 0.0            |\n| Security Risk   | 0.0            |\n\n**All signs point to this being a legitimate, benign setup script with no security concerns.**",
