{
  "purpose": "This script configures the packaging and installation process for the 'ciphey' Python project, specifying dependencies, entry points, metadata, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads package data, dependency requirements, and metadata from static variables; no external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or user input within this script; it only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "The setup configuration data flows from static variables to the 'setup()' function, which then processes the package build; no runtime or external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are detected. All dependencies and metadata are typical for a Python package setup. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging using setuptools. It defines packages, dependencies, entry points, and descriptive metadata without any dynamic code execution or external data sources. All dependencies are version-restricted but legitimate, and the script does not perform any network operations or system modifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage within this setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal Python package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It purely specifies the package's build and distribution parameters without any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
