  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package named 'ciphey', used to configure the package's installation, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads package configuration data, dependencies, entry points, and metadata such as description, author, and URL.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted data or user input; it only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input or data manipulation; the script strictly sets package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The long_description contains extensive HTML content for documentation, but no malicious code is embedded.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools to define package configuration. It specifies a list of packages, package data, dependencies, and entry points. The dependencies are version-restricted but do not include any suspicious or malicious packages. The long_description is a lengthy HTML string for documentation purposes. There are no code execution, data processing, or network operations present. The script adheres to standard Python packaging practices and contains no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It solely defines package installation parameters, dependencies, and metadata without any malicious payload or suspicious logic.",
