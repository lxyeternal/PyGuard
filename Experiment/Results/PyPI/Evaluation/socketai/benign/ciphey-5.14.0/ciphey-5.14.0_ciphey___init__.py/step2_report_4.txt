  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the validity of conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as minimal, consisting solely of import statements from local modules and a decrypt function from ciphey.\n- No evidence of data flow, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs is present.\n- The decrypt function is a standard cryptography utility, not inherently malicious, but its usage elsewhere could pose risks depending on context.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code only imports modules; no active logic or data flow. No issues detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=0.8. These seem reasonable given the minimal code.\n- **Justification for scores:** The low risk score is appropriate; no malware or suspicious activity identified.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, consistent, and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; only import statements, no issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=0.9. Slightly higher confidence but still appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; the decrypt function alone isn't suspicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same minimal import structure; no issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=0.8. Consistent.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; only imports.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0, Confidence=1. The security risk is zero, which is justified.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same minimal import statements.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, SecurityRisk=0.1, Confidence=0.8. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity; the import of 'decrypt' alone isn't suspicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports:**\n\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code only contains import statements.\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Zero, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting minimal security concern given the code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Given the minimal code, a risk score of around 0.1 is reasonable, reflecting potential concern if used maliciously in context, but not in this snippet.\n\n**However, considering the overall context:**\n\n- The code imports cryptography-related functions, which could be misused elsewhere.\n- Without further context, the risk remains low, but the potential for misuse exists if the decrypt function is exploited.\n\n**Therefore, my adjusted scores are:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports)\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. The code snippet is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate, given the context.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- Continue monitoring how the 'decrypt' function is used elsewhere.\n- Maintain vigilance if additional code shows data handling or network activity.\n\n**Overall, the reports are thorough and accurate.**",
