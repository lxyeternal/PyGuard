{
  "purpose": "The code imports local modules related to cryptography and a decrypt function from the ciphey module, likely setting up cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: basemods, common, iface; and the decrypt function from ciphey.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules and a cryptography utility. There is no executable logic, data processing, network activity, or hardcoded secrets. The presence of a decrypt function does not imply malicious intent; it is a common cryptographic utility. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this snippet. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation at 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal threat in this context.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, serving as setup for cryptographic operations. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
