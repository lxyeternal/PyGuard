  "purpose": "Utility functions for dynamic class generation and string case adjustment.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: 'value' in id_lambda; 'target' and 'base' strings in fix_case.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal data manipulation only.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' flows into lambda returned by id_lambda; 'target' and 'base' influence string case in fix_case.",
  "anomalies": "Duplicate return statement in fix_case, which appears to be a coding mistake, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises simple utility functions with straightforward logic. No network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns are present. The duplicate return in fix_case is redundant but not malicious. The id_lambda function creates lambdas that return a constant value, which could be misused but is benign in isolation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The redundancy in fix_case is a minor coding issue. The overall security risk is very low, and the malware score is zero. The existing reports' assessments are accurate and consistent.",
