  "anomalies": [
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets.",
    "Standard version and platform checks.",
    "Conditional platform-specific messages and exits.",
    "No obfuscated code, no unusual language features."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward environment validation tasks: it checks Python version, platform compatibility, and system architecture. It then conditionally exits or proceeds to import and run the main Ciphey module. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The import is relative, assuming a package structure, and is used to execute main logic only after validation. No hidden or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions solely as a compatibility check and launcher for the Ciphey tool without any malicious intent. It does not perform any suspicious activities or malicious behavior. The code appears benign and consistent with its purpose as a version and platform validator.",
