  "purpose": "The script is a launcher for the Ciphey project, verifying Python version and platform compatibility before executing the main functionality.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys.maxsize, platform.system()",
  "sinks": "Importing and executing 'main()' from the ciphey module",
  "flows": "Input from sys.version_info and platform.system() → conditional checks and messages → import ciphey.main → execution of main()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or suspicious code constructs detected. Checks are standard version and platform validations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment validation to ensure compatibility with Ciphey. It verifies the Python version is 3.6+ and platform specifics, then conditionally exits if requirements are not met. It imports and runs 'main()' from the ciphey module. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious data manipulations are present. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious constructs. It functions as a typical environment check and launcher.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate environment validator and launcher for the Ciphey project. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are identified.",
