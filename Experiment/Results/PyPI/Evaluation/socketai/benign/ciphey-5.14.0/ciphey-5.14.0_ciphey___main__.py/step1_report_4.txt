  "purpose": "Check Python environment compatibility and invoke the main function of the Ciphey decryption tool.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info (sys.version_info), platform system info (platform.system()), and maximum integer size (sys.maxsize).",
  "sinks": "Calls the 'main' function imported from the local ciphey module; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Sources (version info, platform info) influence conditional logic that determines whether to exit the program or proceed to import and execute 'main'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code performs environment validation and then runs a main function from an internal module.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily validates the Python environment version and platform compatibility for Ciphey. It prints user guidance and exits if the environment does not meet requirements. The import of 'main' from a local module is standard. No data leaks, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are present. No obfuscation, code injection, or malicious side effects are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs environment checks for the Ciphey application and then runs its main function. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on this code snippet.",
