{
  "purpose": "The script is a launcher for the Ciphey decryption tool, verifying Python environment compatibility before executing the main program.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, platform.system(), platform.sys.maxsize",
  "sinks": "print statements and sys.exit calls, which terminate the program based on environment checks",
  "flows": "Input sources (Python version info, platform info) flow through conditional checks, leading to potential program termination or proceeding to import and run the main module",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors detected. The code performs straightforward environment validation and imports a main function",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment checks to ensure compatibility with specific Python versions and Windows configurations. It issues warnings or terminates execution if conditions are not met. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The import of a local main module is standard for a script-based entry point. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions solely as an environment validator and launcher for the Ciphey project. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. Its purpose is legitimate, and the code appears safe.",
