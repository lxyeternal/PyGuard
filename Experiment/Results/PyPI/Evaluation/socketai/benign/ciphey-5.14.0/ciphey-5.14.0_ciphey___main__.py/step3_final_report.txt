  "purpose": "Environment validation and launcher for the Ciphey project, checking Python version, platform, and architecture before executing main() from the local ciphey module.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, platform.system(), sys.maxsize",
  "sinks": "import of .ciphey and execution of main()",
  "flows": "version checks and platform/architecture validation leading to import and execution of main()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard environment validation and module import",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment validation by checking Python version, platform, and architecture, then imports and runs main() from a local module. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. The import is relative, typical for package modules. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The logic is straightforward and aligns with a standard launcher script. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment validation script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications or escalations are necessary.",
