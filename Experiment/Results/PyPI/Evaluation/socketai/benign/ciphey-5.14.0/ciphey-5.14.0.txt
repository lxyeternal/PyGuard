      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup configuration for the 'ciphey' package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor securityRisk score of 0.1 in the last report is an overestimate; the actual risk is negligible."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious or obfuscated content. The primary concern is the logical bug in 'is_ascii' which should be fixed for correctness. Verbose logging should be managed carefully in production to prevent internal data leaks. Overall, the code poses a very low security risk and does not contain malware."

While this introduces a supply chain risk if paths are untrusted, there is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a moderate security risk (~0.2-0.3). Proper validation of module paths can mitigate this risk."

There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall security assessment should be that the code is safe for use."
