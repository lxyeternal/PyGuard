  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Code Summary & Key Observations:**\n- Utility class with functions: gcd, modular inverse, percentage, sorting probability tables, ASCII validation, punctuation stripping.\n- Uses verbose logging (`loguru`) at TRACE level.\n- Contains a bug in `is_ascii`: it returns `bool(lambda s: len(s) == len(s.encode()))`, which always evaluates to `True` because `bool(lambda ...)` is always `True`. The lambda is not invoked, so the function does not perform its intended check.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or data sinks are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n- The sorting functions are complex but straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- No malicious code, backdoors, or malware behavior detected.\n- The `mod_inv` implementation is naive but correct for small inputs; inefficient but not malicious.\n- Extensive logging could expose internal states but is standard for debugging.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None. The code is benign.\n- **Code correctness:** The `is_ascii` method is flawed; it does not perform as intended. This is a logical bug, not malicious.\n- **Potential security concerns:** Verbose logging could leak internal states if logs are exposed, but this is a standard debugging concern, not a security vulnerability.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Malware:** None.\n- **Suspicious behavior:** None.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring & Justifications:\n| Report | Malware Score | Obfuscated | Risk Score | Justification |\n|---------|----------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|\n| 1       | 0              | 0            | 0.2          | No malicious behavior; benign utility functions. |\n| 2       | 0              | 0            | 0.2          | Same as above; minor bug in `is_ascii`, not malicious. |\n| 3       | 0              | 0            | 0.2          | Same conclusions; bug present but not malicious. |\n| 4       | 0              | 0            | 0.2          | No malicious activity; only a bug in `is_ascii`. |\n| 5       | 0              | 0            | 0.2          | Same; no malicious intent, just verbose logging and a bug. |\n\n**Note:** All reports agree on no malware, no obfuscation, and low security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Critical Analysis:\n- The **`is_ascii`** method's implementation is flawed across all reports, which could lead to logical errors in ASCII validation but not security issues.\n- The **logging** verbosity, while not malicious, could pose information leakage if logs are exposed, but this is a common debugging practice.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, primarily due to verbose logging and a minor bug)\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe code is a benign utility module with a minor logical bug and verbose logging, but no security threats or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, with a small bug in `is_ascii` that does not pose security risks. The logging verbosity should be managed appropriately, but it does not constitute a security vulnerability. The overall security posture is very low risk.",
