  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious or obfuscated content. The primary concern is the logical bug in 'is_ascii' which should be fixed for correctness. Verbose logging should be managed carefully in production to prevent internal data leaks. Overall, the code poses a very low security risk and does not contain malware."
