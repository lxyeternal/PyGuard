{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for mathematical calculations, sorting, and string processing, primarily aimed at NLP and probability table manipulation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read at runtime; the code operates on input parameters provided to functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write data to external systems or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the functions process data passed as arguments without external data flow or untrusted input handling beyond local computations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are evident. The class contains verbose logging via loguru, but this alone is not malicious. The is_ascii method contains an incorrect lambda function that is not invoked, which appears to be an oversight or ineffective code, but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static and instance methods performing mathematical operations (gcd, modular inverse, percentage), sorting dictionaries, and string manipulation. The modular inverse implementation is naive but correct for small inputs. The sort_prob_table method attempts to sort nested probability tables, with detailed logging that does not affect security. The is_ascii method contains an unused lambda, which is ineffective but not malicious. No external data sources, network connections, or code injection mechanisms are present. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign helper functions for mathematical and data manipulation tasks, with no malicious intent or security risks. The only minor concern is the ineffective is_ascii method, which is likely a bug rather than malicious behavior.",
