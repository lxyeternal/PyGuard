  "purpose": "Utility class providing helper functions for mathematical operations, probability table sorting, ASCII validation, and string punctuation removal.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions such as 'prob_table' dictionaries, strings for 'is_ascii' and 'strip_punctuation', and numeric inputs for gcd and mod_inv.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network operations; potential internal data exposure through verbose logs if logs are accessible externally.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions like 'sort_prob_table', 'is_ascii', and 'strip_punctuation'; no external data flows or network communication are present.",
  "anomalies": "The 'is_ascii' method implementation is flawed: it returns a lambda object instead of executing the check, which is a logical bug. Excessive TRACE logging could expose internal states if logs are not secured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility class with functions for gcd, modular inverse, percentage calculation, probability table sorting, ASCII validation, and punctuation stripping. The 'is_ascii' method's implementation is incorrect, returning a lambda object rather than performing the check, which is a logical bug but not security-related. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated constructs are present. The verbose logging, while potentially exposing internal data if logs are accessible externally, is typical for debugging and not malicious. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to verbose logs and the minor bug. The functions are transparent and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious or obfuscated content. The primary concern is the logical bug in 'is_ascii' which should be fixed for correctness. Verbose logging should be managed carefully in production to prevent internal data leaks. Overall, the code poses a very low security risk and does not contain malware.",
