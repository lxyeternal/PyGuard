  "purpose": "Helper functions for mathematical operations, probability table sorting, ASCII validation, and string punctuation removal.",
  "sources": "No direct data input sources; the code operates on provided arguments and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data for security vulnerabilities; primarily static computations and data transformations.",
  "flows": "N/A - the functions process data passed as arguments without external data flow or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code includes detailed logging, which could potentially expose internal states if logs are exposed, but this is standard for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for gcd calculation, modular inverse, percentage calculation, probability table sorting, ASCII validation, and punctuation stripping. All functions use straightforward algorithms without external data or network access. The logging statements are verbose but intended for debugging. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The logic is well-contained, with no suspicious patterns or backdoors. The sorting logic is complex but transparent, and no obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign helper utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not handle sensitive data or perform any network operations. The only potential concern is verbose logging, which should be managed securely in production environments but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
