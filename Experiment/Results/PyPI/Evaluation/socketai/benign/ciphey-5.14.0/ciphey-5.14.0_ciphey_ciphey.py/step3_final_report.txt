{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a command-line interface wrapper for the Ciphey decryption tool, handling user input, configuration loading, and invoking decryption routines to produce plaintext output.",
  "sources": "Input from CLI options, files, or stdin; configuration files loaded from disk.",
  "sinks": "Decrypted results printed to console; configuration files read from disk.",
  "flows": "User input or file/stdin data -> configuration setup -> call to decrypt() -> decryption routines -> output to console.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected. Warnings are globally suppressed, which could hide runtime issues but is common in CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI front-end for Ciphey, managing argument parsing, configuration, and calling decryption functions. No malicious behaviors such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration are present. The suppression of warnings is a standard practice but could conceal runtime warnings. The code relies on external modules and handles input securely. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the code's clarity supports an obfuscated score of zero. The overall security risk is minimal, around 0.2, primarily due to warning suppression and configuration handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured CLI wrapper for an open-source decryption tool, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The low security risk score is justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
