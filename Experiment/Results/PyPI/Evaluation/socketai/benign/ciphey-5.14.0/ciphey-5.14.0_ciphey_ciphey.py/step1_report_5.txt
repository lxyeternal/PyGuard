{
  "purpose": "This script is a command-line interface for the Ciphey decryption tool, facilitating automated decryption of input ciphertexts using various configurable parameters and modules.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line options (-t, --text), stdin, or file input; configuration settings are loaded from configuration files or arguments; environment variables are not explicitly used.",
  "sinks": "Results are output to the console; configuration files are read from disk; potentially sensitive data could be written or logged if logs are exposed, but no explicit sensitive data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from command-line options or stdin to the decrypt() function, where it is processed via the searcher object; configuration data flows from files or arguments into the config object; results flow from decrypt() to console output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration present; no unsafe execution or code injection mechanisms detected. The code primarily reads configuration and user input, then calls into imported modules.",
  "analysis": "The script acts as a CLI front-end that orchestrates decryption processes via the Ciphey library, with input/output handling, configuration management, and logging. It does not include any code that performs network activity, file modification, or system commands that could be malicious. All data inputs are from user-controlled sources, and outputs are displayed to the user. The code does not handle sensitive credentials or secrets within itself. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected in this code segment. The overall design is consistent with a standard CLI application, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI front-end for the Ciphey decryption tool. It handles user input, configuration, and output without performing any malicious actions or containing malicious code. No signs of malware or security risks are present within this module.",
