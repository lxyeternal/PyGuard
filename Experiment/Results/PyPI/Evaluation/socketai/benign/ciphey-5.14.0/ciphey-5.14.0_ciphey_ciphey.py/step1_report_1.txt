{
  "purpose": "The script is an automated decryption tool called Ciphey, designed to decrypt ciphertexts using various algorithms and configurations.",
  "sources": "User inputs via command-line options (-t, -f, positional argument), environment variables (not explicitly used), and configuration files loaded from disk.",
  "sinks": "Decrypted output is printed to the console; config file paths and other parameters are used internally; no network or file writes are directly visible.",
  "flows": "Input sources (command-line or files) feed into decryption functions; configuration parameters flow into the config object; decrypted results flow from decrypt() to output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper for decryption routines. No unusual dynamic execution, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a CLI application that processes user input, loads configurations, and invokes decryption routines. It carefully manages input sources, configuration files, and logging. No network activity, code injection, or malicious data handling is detected. The only potentially sensitive operations are reading input data and loading configuration files, which are standard for such tools. The code does not perform any suspicious actions like data exfiltration, malicious code injection, or hidden backdoors. Overall, it functions as an interface to the underlying decryption mechanisms, which are not included here. The code is well-structured and does not contain obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate CLI wrapper for an automated decryption tool with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It responsibly handles user input and configurations without any suspicious behaviors.",
