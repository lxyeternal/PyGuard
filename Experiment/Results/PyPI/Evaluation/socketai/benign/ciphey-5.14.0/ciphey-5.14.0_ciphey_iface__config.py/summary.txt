  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration and resource management system with dynamic module loading capabilities. While this introduces a supply chain risk if paths are untrusted, there is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and a moderate security risk (~0.2-0.3). Proper validation of module paths can mitigate this risk."
