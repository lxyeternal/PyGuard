  "purpose": "Module initialization and internal component aggregation via import statements from internal modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_config, _modules, _registry, _fwd).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; purely static imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static import of classes and functions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import statements with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static import statements from internal modules, serving as a package initializer or aggregator. There are no dynamic code executions, network activities, or handling of untrusted data. The structure is typical for Python packages, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module import pattern with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
