{
  "purpose": "The code assigns None to the variables 'registry' and 'config', likely for initialization purposes.",
  "sources": "No data input or data reading occurs in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output is present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and only involves variable assignment; no anomalies or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns None to two variables, 'registry' and 'config', with 'config' being set to the type of None. The code does not include any data input, processing, or output. It is likely part of a larger script where these variables are initialized for future use. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or security issues in this small fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple variable initialization with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies detected. It appears benign and standard for setting up variables.",
