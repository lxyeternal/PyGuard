{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize two variables, 'registry' and 'config', with 'None' and a type object respectively. It likely sets up placeholder variables for further configuration or registration processes.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read any input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present as no operations or data assignments involve external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Assigning 'type(None)' to 'config' is unusual but not inherently malicious; it might be a placeholder or a setup step. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares two variables, one assigned to None and the other assigned to the type object of None. There are no data flows, input/output operations, or complex logic. This minimal code snippet does not contain any malicious patterns or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be a setup or placeholder snippet with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
