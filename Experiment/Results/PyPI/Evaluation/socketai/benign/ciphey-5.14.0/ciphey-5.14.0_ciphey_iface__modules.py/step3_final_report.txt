{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract framework for cryptographic modules, including parameter handling, configuration, decoding, cracking, resource management, and search algorithms. It is intended for extensibility and modularity in cryptography-related applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input primarily from class instantiations, configuration objects, and method parameters; no external data sources, network activity, or user input handling are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks or data leaks; the code does not perform network communication, file I/O, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal method calls and configuration attribute access; no untrusted data flows to external systems or sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code is well-structured and purely abstract, with no runtime logic that could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of abstract classes and data structures designed for cryptography modules, decoders, checkers, resource loaders, and search algorithms. It relies on standard Python idioms, type annotations, and the 'rich' library for display purposes. There are no external data sources, network activity, or runtime behaviors that could be malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, risk=0.0 or 0.2) are consistent with the code's nature. The slight elevation in risk scores (0.2) reflects the potential misuse of the framework but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured abstract framework for cryptography and decoding modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the overall security assessment should be that the code is safe for use.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
