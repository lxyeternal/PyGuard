{
  "purpose": "Defines a set of abstract classes and data structures for modular components related to cryptography, decoding, cracking, resource loading, and search strategies within a security or cryptography framework.",
  "sources": "Imports modules such as 'rich' for output and a local configuration module; no user input or external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that handle untrusted data; primarily class definitions and static methods without execution of external commands or data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code mainly defines interfaces and data models without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code contains abstract classes and utility functions typical for a plugin or modular architecture. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed. No network activity or data exfiltration mechanisms present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a framework of abstract base classes and utility functions for cryptographic modules, decoders, crackers, resource loaders, and search algorithms. It uses standard Python features such as ABCs, typing, and data classes. No input/output operations, network calls, or executable code are present. The functions primarily define interfaces to be implemented elsewhere. No signs of malicious payloads, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a cryptography toolkit or security framework.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of abstract base classes and data structures meant for a modular cryptography or security framework. It contains no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and intended for plugin-like extension. No security risks are identified based solely on this code segment.",
