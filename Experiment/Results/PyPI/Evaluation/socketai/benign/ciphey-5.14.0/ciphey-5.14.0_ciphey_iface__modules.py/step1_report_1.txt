{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract framework for various cryptographic and decoding modules, including parameters, configuration, checking, decoding, cracking, resource loading, and search functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (abc, typing), third-party library (rich), and a local module ._fwd (config). No direct input sources such as user input or external data streams are evident.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data leak points such as network, file system, or environment variable manipulations are present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily sets up class structures, abstract methods, and type definitions; there are no active data flows, input/output handling, or untrusted data processing within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code relies on standard design patterns for modular cryptography-related tasks. No obfuscation or hidden backdoors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several abstract classes and data structures intended for cryptography and decoding workflows, including parameter management, checks, decoding, cracking, resource management, and search. It uses static and instance methods, type parameters, and rich library for display formatting. There are no evident points of data injection, malicious network activity, or system manipulation. The code appears to be a clean framework for cryptographic modules with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior embedded within.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a framework for cryptographic and decoding modules, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured for modular extension, and there are no suspicious or malicious elements found.",
