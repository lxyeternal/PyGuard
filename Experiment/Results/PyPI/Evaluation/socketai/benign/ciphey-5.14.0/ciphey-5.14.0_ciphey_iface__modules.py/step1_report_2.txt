{
  "purpose": "This code provides a framework for defining various cryptographic and data processing modules, including configuration handling, cracking, decoding, and resource management.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration objects, method inputs (such as text, ciphertext, or resource names), and class/static method return values. There are no direct network, file, or environment variable reads.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or environment variable modifications. It primarily defines interfaces and data structures without executing potentially dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (texts, resources, configs) into methods like check(), decode(), attemptCrack(), and search(), with some configuration values being read and potentially used for processing. No untrusted data is shown to be passed to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs. The code structure is typical for a plugin-style framework with abstract base classes and method placeholders.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured framework for cryptographic modules with emphasis on configuration, checking, decoding, cracking, and resource management. It mainly consists of abstract classes and data containers, with no runtime logic that could perform malicious actions. The only potential concern would be if any subclass implementations or external resources misused this structure, but as provided, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a framework defining interfaces and data structures for cryptographic and security modules. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks by itself. It appears to be designed for extensibility and modularity. No suspicious or malicious code was detected.",
