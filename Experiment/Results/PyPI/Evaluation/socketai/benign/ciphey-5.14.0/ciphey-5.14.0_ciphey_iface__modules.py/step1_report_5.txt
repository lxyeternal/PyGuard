  "purpose": "Define an abstract framework for various cryptographic and decoding modules, including configuration handling, checking, decoding, cracking, resource loading, and search functionalities.",
  "sources": "Configuration data from 'config' import, class parameters, method parameters, and potentially external inputs via method calls",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code involves no direct data output or external communication mechanisms such as network, files, or environment variables",
  "flows": "Data flows from configuration and parameters into class methods and attributes; no untrusted external data sources or sink points identified",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, hard-coded secrets, or suspicious control flow patterns are present. The code is structured as an abstract framework, with no concrete malicious logic or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of abstract base classes and utility functions for cryptography and decoding modules, including parameter validation, resource management, and result presentation. It uses standard Python idioms, type annotations, and well-known libraries ('rich') for display. There are no network operations, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of sensitive data such as credentials or environment variables. All classes are designed as interfaces or templates, with no actual implementation details that could contain malicious behavior. The absence of data leaks, code injections, or hidden features suggests a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured framework for cryptographic module management without any signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It does not include hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data flows. The overall security risk is minimal.",
