  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code content, logical consistency, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a framework for cryptographic modules, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Findings:** The code is purely structural, defining abstract classes and data containers. No data flows, external I/O, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, risk=0.0\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code. No issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that it's a framework with no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No network, file, or environment variable access; purely interface definitions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a framework with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Findings:** No external data access or execution; uses 'rich' for display, which is harmless.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) due to the use of 'rich' for display purposes, but 'rich' is a benign library. No malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The risk score of 0.2 seems reasonable, considering potential misuse of display libraries, but in this context, it's minimal. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, structured as an abstract framework with no malicious elements.\n- **Findings:** No network, file, or external data handling; standard Python idioms.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same general conclusion: a legitimate cryptography framework, no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No data leaks, backdoors, or suspicious constructs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The small risk score (0.2) is acceptable, given the use of display libraries and the framework nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a set of abstract classes and data structures for cryptography modules.\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is appropriate. No malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0.0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in some reports, justified by the use of 'rich' for display purposes, but no real security risk.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a well-structured, standard framework for cryptographic modules, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- The use of 'rich' for output formatting is benign and does not introduce security risks.\n- The small risk scores (0.2) are reasonable, considering the potential for misuse of display libraries, but in this context, they are minimal.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to the display library, but no real threat)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and their scores are justified. No further adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with appropriate scoring.",
