{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract framework for cryptographic modules, checkers, decoders, resource loaders, and search algorithms, mainly for analysis and cracking of ciphers.",
  "sources": "No direct data input sources; configuration objects passed during initialization.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; code does not process or output untrusted data directly, other than logging/display functions.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters flow from external Config objects to internal module states; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of rich library is for UI, not harmful. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes an abstract class hierarchy for modular cryptography, decoding, and cracking tools, emphasizing structure over implementation. It includes parameters, configuration management, and interfaces for analysis modules. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or covert channels. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or embedded exploits are present. The library is designed for security analysis tasks and does not include code that could directly harm or compromise systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate framework for cryptographic analysis and cracking with no malicious intent. It employs standard programming constructs and no suspicious behavior was detected. It is safe to use from a security perspective.",
