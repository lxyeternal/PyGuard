  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of distributed model evaluation with no signs of malware or malicious obfuscation. The primary security concern is the use of pickle serialization, which is a known risk if data sources are untrusted, but in controlled environments, it is standard practice. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the pickle serialization concern without indicating malicious intent."
