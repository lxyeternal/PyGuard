  "purpose": "Provides functions to locate and load TensorRT plugin libraries, issuing deprecation warnings and status checks.",
  "sources": "File system access via os.path and glob to locate shared object files, environment-dependent paths.",
  "sinks": "ctypes.CDLL is used to load a shared object library, which could execute code from that library.",
  "flows": "get_tensorrt_op_path() locates the shared object file; load_tensorrt_plugin() loads it into the process if not loaded; is_tensorrt_plugin_loaded() checks status.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated use of warning messages about deprecation and usage of ctypes.CDLL to load external shared libraries; no user input handling or network communication.",
  "analysis": "The code locates shared libraries based on a relative path and loads them via ctypes, which is a standard method for dynamic library loading. Warnings about deprecation are non-malicious but indicate the function might be outdated. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. Usage of warnings and library loading appears routine for plugin management. The code does not perform any data exfiltration, network communication, or system manipulation beyond library loading. The potential risk lies in loading external libraries, but this is typical for plugin systems and does not, by itself, indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin loader with deprecation warnings. It does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious code patterns. It is a legitimate library loading routine with no evident malware indicators.",
