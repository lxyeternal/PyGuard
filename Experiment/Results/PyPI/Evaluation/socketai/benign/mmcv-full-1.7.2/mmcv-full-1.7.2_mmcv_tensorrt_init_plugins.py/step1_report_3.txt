  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve, check, and load TensorRT plugin libraries for deployment.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.path.dirname, os.path.join, glob.glob, os.path.exists, warnings.warn, ctypes.CDLL",
  "sinks": "ctypes.CDLL(lib_path)",
  "flows": "get_tensorrt_op_path -> load_tensorrt_plugin -> ctypes.CDLL(lib_path)",
  "anomalies": "Repeated warnings with identical messages; no input validation for lib_path; no explicit security checks on the library file; no user input or external data validation.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a path to a shared object file based on the script's directory, then uses ctypes.CDLL to load it if it exists. It also issues deprecation warnings before performing actions. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior. The use of ctypes.CDLL could pose a risk if the library path is malicious, but the code only loads a local file determined by safe path construction. The repeated warnings are benign and related to deprecation notices. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. Overall, the code performs legitimate library loading functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for loading a local shared library with no malicious behavior detected. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious operations. The only concern could be the reliance on local files, but given the context, it seems intended for legitimate deployment purposes.",
