  "purpose": "Provides functions to locate, check, and load TensorRT plugin libraries, with user warnings about deprecation and usage.",
  "sources": "os.path, glob.glob, os.path.exists, warnings.warn, ctypes.CDLL",
  "sinks": "ctypes.CDLL(lib_path) loads a shared library potentially from a user-controlled path",
  "flows": "get_tensorrt_op_path() retrieves a library path; load_tensorrt_plugin() loads the library if it exists and not already loaded",
  "anomalies": "Repeated warning messages with deprecation notices, no direct user input or external data influencing library path; no hardcoded credentials or secret data",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for handling TensorRT plugins, generating warnings about deprecation, and conditionally loading shared libraries. The library path is constructed from the directory structure, not user input. Warnings are harmless notifications. The library is loaded via ctypes only if the path exists and not already loaded. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for handling TensorRT plugin libraries, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
