  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step and assess the security implications:\n\n1. **Code Behavior & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports describe functions that locate and load a shared library (`_ext_trt.*.so`) from the filesystem.\n   - The code issues deprecation warnings with styled console output, then performs filesystem checks and loads libraries via `ctypes.CDLL`.\n   - No user input, network activity, or external data influences these operations.\n   - The code appears to be standard utility functions for plugin management, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The repeated deprecation warnings could clutter logs but are benign.\n   - The library path is constructed based on relative directory structure, which is typical for plugin systems.\n   - No input validation or security checks on the library file are performed, but given the context, this is standard practice.\n   - No evidence of obfuscation or malicious code snippets.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across all reports. This aligns with the analysis that no malicious code is present.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward, readable code.\n   - **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security risk due to filesystem operations and dynamic loading, which are typical in plugin systems.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.2, which is reasonable.\n   - Given the benign nature, a higher score would be unjustified unless external factors or user input were involved.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions & Claims:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code only loads local shared libraries and issues warnings.\n   - No false positives or unwarranted assumptions about malicious intent are evident.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's behavior—no malware, no obfuscation, low security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, typical for filesystem and library loading operations)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard utility for locating and loading TensorRT plugin libraries, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The deprecation warnings are benign and do not impact security.\n\n**If I were to assign my own scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard plugin management code)\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the detailed analysis.",
