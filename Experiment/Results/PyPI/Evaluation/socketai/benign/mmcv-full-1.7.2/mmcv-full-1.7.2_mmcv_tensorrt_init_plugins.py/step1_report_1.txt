{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to locate and load TensorRT plugin libraries with warning messages about deprecation.",
  "sources": "Reads the filesystem to find library files using glob and os.path, and checks for library existence with os.path.exists.",
  "sinks": "Potentially loads a shared library via ctypes.CDLL, which can execute code within the library.",
  "flows": "Filesystem check (os.path.exists) and library loading (ctypes.CDLL) happen after warning messages; no untrusted user input directly influences these actions.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated warning messages with styled output; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code present. The code appears to be standard utility code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to locate and load a TensorRT plugin library, with user warnings about deprecation. It reads filesystem paths using glob and os.path for library discovery, and loads the library via ctypes if not already loaded. No untrusted input, external network connections, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code follows normal practices for dynamic library loading, with clear, benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for managing TensorRT plugins, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It includes deprecation warnings and performs standard filesystem and library loading operations. No malicious or security-sensitive issues are evident.",
