  "purpose": "Utility functions to locate and load TensorRT plugin shared libraries, issuing deprecation warnings and managing plugin loading state.",
  "sources": "Filesystem paths constructed via os.path and glob; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "Loading shared libraries with ctypes.CDLL from local filesystem paths.",
  "flows": "Filesystem path creation -> check existence -> ctypes.CDLL load (if not loaded) -> set plugin_is_loaded flag.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated styled deprecation warnings; no input validation on library paths; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard plugin management tasks: locating shared libraries in the filesystem and loading them dynamically. It issues benign deprecation warnings with styled terminal output. No external data, network activity, or user input is involved. The use of ctypes.CDLL is typical for plugin systems, and the paths are constructed from local directories, minimizing external influence. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation are present. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clarity of the code. The risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in loading local shared libraries, which is standard practice in plugin management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for locating and loading local TensorRT plugin libraries. It issues deprecation warnings but does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
