  "purpose": "Provide functions to retrieve, check, and load TensorRT plugin libraries, with user warnings about deprecation and usage.",
  "sources": "File system access via os.path and glob, environment warnings via warnings.warn",
  "sinks": "ctypes.CDLL invocation potentially loading a library from the filesystem based on a path",
  "flows": "get_tensorrt_op_path() generates a path; load_tensorrt_plugin() calls ctypes.CDLL with the path if conditions are met",
  "anomalies": "Repeated warning messages with embedded styled text; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious input handling; reliance on filesystem paths for dynamic library loading",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for managing TensorRT plugin libraries, including path retrieval and dynamic loading. Warnings are issued at each function call with styled messages, but these do not affect security. The loading function dynamically loads a library from a filesystem path if it exists and has not been loaded before. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious actions are evident. The use of ctypes.CDLL is standard for loading shared libraries, and the code appears to be for legitimate deployment purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is for legitimate library management and deployment, with no signs of malicious intent. It performs dynamic library loading based on filesystem checks and issues styled warnings. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
