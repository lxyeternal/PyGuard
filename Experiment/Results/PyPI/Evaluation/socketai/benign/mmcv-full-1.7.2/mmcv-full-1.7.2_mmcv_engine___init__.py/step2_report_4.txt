  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward import/export module, importing functions from a local `.test` module and defining `__all__`.\n- No data input handling, no dynamic execution, no network activity, or suspicious code patterns are observed.\n- The code appears to be a typical module initialization or interface file in a Python package, likely part of a machine learning framework.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the original code snippet exactly.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present.\n- **Security risks:** No evident security issues; the code is benign.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, standard, and secure. No issues are present.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- No logical flaws, errors, or mistakes are evident in the reports. They all correctly interpret the code as a benign module setup.\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Confidence levels:** Mostly 1, indicating high confidence, which is justified given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Recommendations for score adjustments:\n\n- The third report assigns a security risk of 0.1, which is slightly higher than necessary given the benign analysis. It would be more consistent to set this to 0.\n- The malware scores are all correctly 0; no change needed.\n- The obfuscated scores are all 0, correct.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are detected, the risk scores should remain at **0** for all categories.\n- Even if some reports have slightly higher scores, they should be adjusted downward to reflect the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nBased on all reports, the code is a standard, benign module import/export pattern with no security issues.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No anomalies, errors, or suspicious behavior.\n- Scores should be consistent at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep all scores at 0, reflecting the code's safe and standard nature.",
