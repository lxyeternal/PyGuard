{
  "purpose": "The code exports specific testing functions related to multi-GPU and single-GPU testing in a machine learning framework, likely for modular importation.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions from a local module named .test.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "The module imports functions and exposes them via __all__, with no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The code is straightforward and standard for a Python package module.",
  "analysis": "The code solely handles importing functions and defining an export list. There is no user input handling, no network operations, no data processing, or other potentially malicious activity. The structure is standard for Python package modules and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module for exporting functions related to testing procedures in a machine learning framework. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
