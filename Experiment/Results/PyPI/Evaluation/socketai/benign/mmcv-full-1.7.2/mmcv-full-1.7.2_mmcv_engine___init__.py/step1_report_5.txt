{
  "purpose": "This code exports specific testing functions related to result collection and testing in a machine learning framework, likely for use in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.test), which provides functions such as collect_results_cpu, collect_results_gpu, multi_gpu_test, and single_gpu_test.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage; the code only exports functions without executing or handling external input directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply imports and re-exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module and defines __all__ for module exports. There are no apparent data flows involving untrusted input or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a standard module setup for a machine learning project, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that exports testing functions, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign component of a larger framework.",
