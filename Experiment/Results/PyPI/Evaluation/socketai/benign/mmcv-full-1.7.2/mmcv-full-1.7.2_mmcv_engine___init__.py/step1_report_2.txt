{
  "purpose": "Export functions related to testing in a machine learning framework, likely for result collection and testing on CPU or GPU.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions from a local module (.test).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform potentially dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "The imported functions are made available for external use but are not called or executed within this snippet; no data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard import and export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a module named .test and then declares them as part of the module's __all__ list for export. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs. The code appears to serve a typical purpose in a testing or evaluation framework for machine learning models. No external data input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard and benign, serving as a module interface for testing functions. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
