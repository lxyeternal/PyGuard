{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that imports and exposes testing functions related to GPU and CPU result collection and testing, likely for a machine learning or computer vision framework.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.test), which may contain various functions that read data or perform operations.",
  "sinks": "The functions imported may serve as sinks if they handle untrusted input or perform insecure operations, but from this snippet, they are just references without implementation details.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions that potentially process data; however, no data flow or execution logic is present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward, with standard import and export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from a local module, likely related to testing procedures. It only exposes these functions via __all__. There are no data inputs, no external data handling, and no active code that could be exploited. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that re-exports testing functions. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is likely part of a larger framework and appears safe based on this snippet.",
