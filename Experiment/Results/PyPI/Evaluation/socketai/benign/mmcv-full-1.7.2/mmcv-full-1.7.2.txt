      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build setup with potential supply chain risks primarily related to external resource handling. No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation was found. The main risk stems from external URL reliance without validation, but this is typical in such build scripts."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of distributed model evaluation with no signs of malware or malicious obfuscation. The primary security concern is the use of pickle serialization, which is a known risk if data sources are untrusted, but in controlled environments, it is standard practice. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the pickle serialization concern without indicating malicious intent."

The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible, approximately 0.1 due to stylistic warnings. The confidence in this assessment is high."

It uses internal APIs for compatibility but does not contain malicious code or behavior. The internal API usage is justified but could pose future stability issues if internal APIs change. Overall, the code is safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation."
