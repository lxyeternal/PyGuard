  "purpose": "Determine if PyTorch JIT tracing is currently active based on the version and tracing status",
  "sources": "torch.__version__, torch.jit.is_tracing(), torch._C._is_tracing()",
  "sinks": "None present; no data leakage or malicious data handling",
  "flows": "Version check -> JIT tracing status -> Conditional return based on version and tracing status",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior; use of warnings for version support",
  "analysis": "The code checks the PyTorch version to determine if JIT tracing status can be safely queried. It uses standard version comparison functions and conditional logic. It calls known PyTorch API functions to identify tracing state and issues warnings if the version is below 1.6.0. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is standard for feature compatibility and version handling, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version and feature check for PyTorch JIT tracing support. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The primary function is to adapt to different PyTorch versions and warn users accordingly.",
