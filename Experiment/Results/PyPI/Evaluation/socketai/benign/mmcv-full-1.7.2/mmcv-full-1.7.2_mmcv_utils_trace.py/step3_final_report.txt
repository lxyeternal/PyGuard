  "purpose": "Determine if the code checks JIT tracing status with version handling and internal API fallback.",
  "sources": "Reads torch.__version__, calls torch.jit.is_tracing(), and accesses torch._C._is_tracing() as a fallback.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks; internal API usage is for internal compatibility checks.",
  "flows": "Version check leads to conditional call to torch.jit.is_tracing() or torch._C._is_tracing().",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal API torch._C._is_tracing(), which is not part of the public API but used here for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a version check to determine if PyTorch's JIT tracing is active. It uses the public API torch.jit.is_tracing() for versions >= 1.6.0, and falls back to the internal API torch._C._is_tracing() for compatibility with older versions. The internal API is known to be used internally within PyTorch but is not documented for public use. The code issues a warning if the version is below 1.6.0, indicating that is_tracing should be set manually. There are no data leaks, network calls, or malicious payloads. The internal API usage is for compatibility, not malicious activity. The code is straightforward and serves as a utility function for version compatibility and internal state checking.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for checking JIT tracing status across different PyTorch versions. It uses internal APIs for compatibility but does not contain malicious code or behavior. The internal API usage is justified but could pose future stability issues if internal APIs change. Overall, the code is safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.",
