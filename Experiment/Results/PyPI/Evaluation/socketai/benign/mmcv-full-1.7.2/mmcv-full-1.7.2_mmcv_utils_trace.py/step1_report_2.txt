  "purpose": "To check whether PyTorch JIT tracing is active based on the version and internal state.",
  "sources": "Reads the PyTorch version (__version__) and calls torch.jit.is_tracing() or torch._C._is_tracing() for tracing status.",
  "sinks": "Calls torch.jit.is_tracing() and torch._C._is_tracing() which are internal functions used to determine tracing state.",
  "flows": "Checks version -> conditionally calls internal tracing functions -> returns tracing status or warning.",
  "anomalies": "Uses internal or undocumented functions (torch._C._is_tracing) which could be unstable or intended for internal use. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs. Warnings are benign but indicate version limitations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily checks the PyTorch version to determine support for tracing status. It uses a combination of public and internal functions to establish whether JIT tracing is active. The use of internal function torch._C._is_tracing() could be considered a potential anomaly but is not inherently malicious. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code contains version checks and warnings but no data exfiltration or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a version-dependent check on whether PyTorch JIT tracing is active, using internal functions for compatibility. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It’s a typical utility function with benign intent.",
