{
  "purpose": "The code performs environment checks for the 'tensorrt' module, conditionally loads related plugins and utilities, and manages the module's __all__ exports for optional TensorRT support.",
  "sources": "Import statements for is_tensorrt_plugin_loaded, load_tensorrt_plugin, preprocess_onnx; runtime import of 'tensorrt' module; conditional import of tensorrt_utils; call to load_tensorrt_plugin()",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network activity, or untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "Import 'tensorrt' -> delete 'tensorrt' -> load_trt_engine, onnx2trt, save_trt_engine (if available) -> extend __all__ with these functions",
  "anomalies": "The 'del tensorrt' statement after import is unusual but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code checks for 'tensorrt' module availability via import, then conditionally loads related utilities and plugins, managing __all__ accordingly. The 'del tensorrt' line removes the module from memory after the check, which is unconventional but benign. No network, data leakage, or malicious code is present. The dynamic import pattern and plugin management are standard practices. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard plugin management snippet for optional dependency loading with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The 'del tensorrt' statement is unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk and is safe for use.",
