  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code checks for TensorRT availability, conditionally loads modules, and loads plugins if available.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, no malicious activity. The dynamic import and plugin loading are standard practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. The risk score is slightly above zero, but given the benign nature, it might be slightly overstated.\n- **Justification:** The code performs environment checks and loads optional components, typical for such setups.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing plugin management and conditional imports.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior detected. The only potential concern is the `load_tensorrt_plugin()` function, but it appears to be a standard utility.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Again, a low risk, but perhaps slightly high given the benign analysis.\n- **Justification:** Standard plugin loading pattern, no suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, with emphasis on environment-dependent plugin loading.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation. The code is straightforward.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The risk score seems appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No security concerns.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, with a note on the `del tensorrt` statement.\n- **Findings:** The deletion of the module after import is unusual but not malicious. No backdoors or network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. The risk score is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The unusual `del` statement is likely a design choice, not malicious.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard plugin management.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently assign 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious activity. The dynamic imports and plugin loading are standard practices.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0; the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.2), but given the benign analysis, a more appropriate risk score should be very low, around 0.1 or even 0.05, considering the code's purpose and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n### Additional Observations:\n- The `del tensorrt` statement in Report 4 is unusual but not malicious; it might be a design choice to free memory or prevent further use of the module.\n- The code does not process untrusted input, perform network communication, or handle secrets.\n- The dynamic import pattern is standard for optional dependencies.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Score |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | **0.0**         |\n| Obfuscated     | **0.0**         |\n| Security Risk  | **0.05**       |\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a typical plugin management script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores in the reports slightly overstate the risk, so I recommend setting them to the minimal possible values to reflect the benign nature.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, standard for optional dependency handling, and poses no security threat.",
