{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and loads plugins and utility functions related to TensorRT and ONNX preprocessing for a machine learning framework.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, checks for the presence of the 'tensorrt' package, and dynamically loads plugins and functions based on availability.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network communication, file writing, or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tensorrt' module -> conditionally loads related utilities and plugins -> extends the list of available functions accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The dynamic import and conditional plugin loading are standard practices in plugin management.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and functions, performs a runtime check for the 'tensorrt' module, and conditionally loads related utilities and plugins. It uses exception handling to detect module presence, which is a common pattern. No malicious or suspicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The purpose appears to be modular plugin loading based on available dependencies, with no obfuscated or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical plugin management script that conditionally loads TensorRT and ONNX utilities based on environment availability. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
