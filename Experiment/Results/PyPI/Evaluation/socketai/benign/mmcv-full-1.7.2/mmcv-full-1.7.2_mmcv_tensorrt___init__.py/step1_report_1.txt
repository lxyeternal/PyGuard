{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and conditionally loads TensorRT plugins and utility functions for model processing, primarily related to AI inference optimizations.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, a function call to check TensorRT availability, and the load_tensorrt_plugin() function. It also dynamically imports modules based on runtime checks.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed. The code performs import checks and function calls that do not handle external or untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Source: Import statements and is_tensorrt_available() check -> Conditional import and plugin load -> Extending __all__ with utility functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The dynamic import based on runtime checks is standard for optional dependencies and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code or misleading constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for the availability of the TensorRT library by attempting to import it. If available, it loads specific modules related to TensorRT optimization, including plugin loading. The use of dynamic imports and conditional logic aligns with standard practices for optional dependencies. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The code appears to be part of a larger package designed for AI model optimization, with proper handling of optional dependencies and plugin loading.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for conditional dependency loading of TensorRT modules. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It performs environment checks and loads optional components accordingly. Overall, it appears safe and intended for performance optimization in AI workflows.",
