  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Checks for the presence of the 'tensorrt' library via a try-except import.\n- If available, imports related utility functions and classes.\n- Loads the TensorRT plugin library via `load_tensorrt_plugin()`.\n- Extends the `__all__` list with relevant functions/classes.\n- Performs standard dependency management for optional features.\n- No network activity, data handling, or obfuscated/malicious code detected.\n- The 'del tensorrt' statement removes the imported module after checking, which is unusual but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code's logic aligns with standard practices for optional dependency handling.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.\n- The `del tensorrt` statement is unusual but not inherently malicious; it likely aims to prevent further use of the module after the check.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The main questionable element is the `del tensorrt` statement. While unusual, it does not pose a security risk but could potentially cause confusion or issues if subsequent code expects the module to be available.\n- No actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are present.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Generally low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting standard dependency management without significant security concerns.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.2, which seems appropriate.\n- The only slightly unusual element is the `del tensorrt`, but it does not justify a higher risk score.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- No contradictions or assumptions that are not supported by the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and readable.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, primarily due to the unusual `del tensorrt` statement, which is a benign design choice.\n\n---\n\n### Additional comments:\n- The overall security posture of this code is very high.\n- No signs of supply chain attack, malicious payload, or suspicious behavior.\n- The dynamic import pattern and plugin loading are standard for optional dependencies.\n\n**In conclusion,** I agree with the existing assessments: the code is safe, with no malicious intent, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis reflects a benign, well-structured plugin management script with a minor unusual element that does not impact security.",
