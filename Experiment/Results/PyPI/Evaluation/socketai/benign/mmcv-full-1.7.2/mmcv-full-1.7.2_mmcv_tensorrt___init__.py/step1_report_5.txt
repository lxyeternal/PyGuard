{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to conditionally import and load TensorRT plugins and utilities for deep learning model acceleration and preprocessing, based on the availability of the TensorRT library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the presence of the 'tensorrt' module to determine availability. It also imports specific functions and modules related to plugin loading and preprocessing.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be the dynamic import and plugin loading functions, but they are limited to library imports and function calls with no untrusted input involved.",
  "flows": "Checks for 'tensorrt' availability, then conditionally imports and loads plugins, extending the module's exported symbols accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs standard dynamic module checking and conditional imports, which are common in plugin-based architectures.",
  "analysis": "The script verifies the presence of the 'tensorrt' library and, if available, imports related utility functions and loads plugins dynamically. It uses a try-except block to prevent errors if 'tensorrt' is missing. The code then extends the __all__ list to expose certain functions and classes. The approach is standard for optional dependency handling. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code is present. The code does not perform network operations, file modifications, or system commands outside controlled library functions. Overall, it appears to be a benign setup script for plugin management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical plugin loader with conditional imports based on library availability. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The structure and functions used are standard for managing optional dependencies in Python projects.",
