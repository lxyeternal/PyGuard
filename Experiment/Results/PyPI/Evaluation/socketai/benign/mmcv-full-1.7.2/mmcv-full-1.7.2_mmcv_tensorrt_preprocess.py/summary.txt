  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for ONNX model adjustment, with no malicious intent or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the use of colored warnings, which is harmless. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible, approximately 0.1 due to stylistic warnings. The confidence in this assessment is high."
