{
  "purpose": "The code modifies an ONNX model to address compatibility issues with TensorRT plugins, specifically adjusting certain nodes and attributes for deployment purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input ONNX model (onnx_model parameter), accesses graph nodes and initializers, and reads node attributes and raw data within the model.",
  "sinks": "Creates new ONNX nodes; potentially modifies existing nodes, but does not write or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input model -> Parsing node attributes and initializers -> Modifying or removing specific nodes (NonMaxSuppression, InstanceNormalization) -> Returning modified model.",
  "anomalies": "Contains warnings with embedded ANSI escape sequences; no hardcoded credentials or hidden backdoors; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly performs model graph manipulations: identifying and modifying specific ONNX nodes to resolve compatibility issues. It includes functions to parse node data, mark nodes for removal, and replace certain nodes with new configurations. The embedded warning message with ANSI codes is benign and informational. No external network calls, file operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's structure and purpose align with standard model preprocessing tasks for deployment. No malicious or maliciously intended code segments are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign utility for ONNX model modification intended for deployment compatibility. It does not contain any malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The presence of styled warning messages is harmless and related to deprecation notices. Overall, it is a legitimate and safe piece of code.",
