{
  "purpose": "The code preprocesses ONNX models to resolve conflicts for compatibility with TensorRT plugins, mainly modifying specific node types and attributes in the model graph.",
  "sources": "Reads ONNX model input, including graph nodes, initializers, node attributes, and node outputs.",
  "sinks": "Modifies the ONNX model graph, potentially rewriting nodes and attributes, but does not write external data or communicate over the network.",
  "flows": "Reads input model -> processes nodes (especially 'NonMaxSuppression' and 'InstanceNormalization') -> modifies or replaces nodes -> outputs the modified ONNX model.",
  "anomalies": "Uses color escape sequences and warnings (not malicious), no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs structured modifications to an ONNX model, specifically handling 'NonMaxSuppression' nodes by extracting attribute values and replacing nodes with updated versions. It also renames 'InstanceNormalization' nodes. The parsing functions handle node attributes and initializers carefully, with no unsafe code patterns. The use of warnings and color sequences is benign, intended for user notification. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors are present. The code strictly manipulates the model structure, adhering to intended preprocessing functions.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs legitimate model preprocessing with no evident malicious behavior. It updates certain nodes for compatibility, with no signs of malware or security risks. No suspicious network or data leakage activities are observed.",
