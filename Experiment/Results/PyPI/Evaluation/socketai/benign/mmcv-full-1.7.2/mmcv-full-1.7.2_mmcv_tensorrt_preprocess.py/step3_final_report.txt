{
  "purpose": "The code modifies an ONNX model graph to ensure compatibility with TensorRT plugins, specifically adjusting node attributes and renaming certain nodes for deployment.",
  "sources": "Reads node outputs, node inputs, and initializers within the ONNX graph; accesses node attributes and raw data buffers.",
  "sinks": "Creates new ONNX nodes, modifies existing nodes; no external data or network activity involved.",
  "flows": "Source data (node outputs/inputs and initializers) is processed to generate modified nodes, replacing original nodes in the graph.",
  "anomalies": "Uses ANSI escape sequences for colored terminal warnings, which is unusual but not malicious; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard graph transformations on an ONNX model, adjusting nodes like 'NonMaxSuppression' and 'InstanceNormalization'. It reads node attributes and raw data buffers, constructs new nodes with modified parameters, and replaces or removes certain nodes. The warning message with ANSI escape sequences is benign and intended for user notification. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is detected. The code's purpose is legitimate model preprocessing for deployment, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for ONNX model adjustment, with no malicious intent or security risks. The only minor anomaly is the use of colored warnings, which is harmless. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible, approximately 0.1 due to stylistic warnings. The confidence in this assessment is high.",
