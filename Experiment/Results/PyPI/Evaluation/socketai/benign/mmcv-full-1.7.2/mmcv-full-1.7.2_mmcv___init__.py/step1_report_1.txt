  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module import and warning setup for the MMCV library, likely used in computer vision applications.",
  "sources": "Imports from local submodules (.arraymisc, .fileio, .image, .utils, .version, .video, .visualization); warning message using warnings.warn()",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or output data in an insecure manner",
  "flows": "The imports and the warning do not involve data flows that could lead to vulnerabilities",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code; only standard import statements and a warning message",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple submodules, which is typical for a package initialization script. The warning informs users about upcoming changes to the package. There are no input handling, data processing, or execution of untrusted code. No malicious or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization with a user warning message. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
