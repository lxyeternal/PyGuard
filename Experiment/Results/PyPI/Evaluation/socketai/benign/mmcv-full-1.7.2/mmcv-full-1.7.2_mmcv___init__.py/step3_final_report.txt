  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization script for the MMCV library, importing various submodules and issuing an informational warning about upcoming version changes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.arraymisc, .fileio, .image, .utils, .version, .video, .visualization); warnings.warn() call",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution present",
  "flows": "Import statements and warning message are executed sequentially; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and warning pattern, no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py module that imports submodules and issues a benign warning. It contains no untrusted input handling, no network activity, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscation. All security and malware scores are appropriately zero, reflecting the benign nature. The code does not perform any operations that could compromise security or contain malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are accurate and correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0. No further action or concern is warranted.",
