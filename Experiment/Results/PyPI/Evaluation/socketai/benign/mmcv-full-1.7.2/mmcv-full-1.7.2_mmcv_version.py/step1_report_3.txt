  "purpose": "Define functions and variables for version parsing and version info retrieval for a software package.",
  "sources": "Reading the '__version__' string and importing 'parse' from 'packaging.version'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input, no data leak points, no external communication, no sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "The version string '__version__' is used to generate 'version_info'. The 'parse_version_info' function processes external version strings into tuples.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code, no obfuscated behavior. The import and version parsing are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and provides functions to parse version information. It imports 'parse' from a standard library package, uses assertions for validation, and extends version release data with pre/post release info if applicable. All operations are related to version handling. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The code appears to be straightforward and standard for version management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard version parsing and information retrieval logic with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
