{
  "purpose": "To parse a version string into a tuple with detailed version components.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module version string '__version__' and the 'version_str' parameter passed to 'parse_version_info'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks, malicious actions, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The source '__version__' is used to initialize 'version_info'. The function 'parse_version_info' takes an input string 'version_str' from external input but only processes it internally with the 'packaging.version.parse' method. There are no flows leading to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The import statement is local within the function scope, which is standard. The version parsing and tuple construction are straightforward and standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module-level version string and a function to parse version strings into detailed tuples. The function uses the 'packaging' library to parse version info, which is a standard and safe approach. It ensures proper parsing and handling of prerelease or postrelease versions. No external inputs are taken dynamically apart from the function parameter, and there are no system calls or network activities. The code is well-structured, and no malicious or suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version parsing utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply processes version information, and there are no dangerous operations or data leaks involved.",
