{
  "purpose": "Define version information and provide a utility function to parse version strings into tuples.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and the input parameter 'version_str' in parse_version_info.",
  "sinks": "The parsed version data stored in 'version_info' and returned by parse_version_info.",
  "flows": "The version string '__version__' is split into parts; 'version_str' is parsed, and its components are processed and returned as a tuple.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'parse' function from 'packaging.version' to parse version strings. It defines 'parse_version_info' to convert version strings into a tuple, handling pre-releases and post-releases. The 'version_info' variable is set by splitting a static version string. The code is straightforward, with no apparent malicious intent or suspicious activity. No external data sources, network connections, or sensitive data handling is present. It is a simple utility for version parsing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign version parsing utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It serves a legitimate purpose in version management.",
