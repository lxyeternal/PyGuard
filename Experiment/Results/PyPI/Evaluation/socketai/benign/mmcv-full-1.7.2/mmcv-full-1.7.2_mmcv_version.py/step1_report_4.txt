  "purpose": "Define versioning information and parse version strings into structured tuples for comparison or processing.",
  "sources": "Reading the module-level variable '__version__', importing 'parse' from 'packaging.version'.",
  "sinks": "Converting version strings into tuples; no sink operations that handle untrusted data or cause side effects.",
  "flows": "Parsing '__version__' into 'version_info' and calling 'parse_version_info' with input version strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard version parsing and tuple operations. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles version parsing using standard libraries. It imports 'parse' from 'packaging.version' to process version strings, which is a common and safe practice. The function 'parse_version_info' converts version strings into tuples, extending with pre/post-release info if applicable. The module exposes version info and the parser function. No data flows involve untrusted input sources; '__version__' is a hardcoded string, and the function usage is typical. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version parsing utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It uses standard libraries appropriately and does not contain any suspicious or harmful operations.",
