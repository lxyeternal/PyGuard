  "purpose": "A utility to parse version strings into detailed tuples, handling pre- and post-release info.",
  "sources": "The version string '__version__' and the input parameter 'version_str'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; only internal parsing and tuple creation.",
  "flows": "Input version string flows through 'parse_version_info' to produce a tuple with version components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of 'packaging.version.parse' with no suspicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a standard, well-established library to parse version strings, handling pre- and post-release info correctly. It does not process untrusted input dynamically in a risky way, nor does it perform network or system modifications. The logic is clear, safe, and appropriate for its purpose. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are justified and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard version parsing utility with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports accurately reflect this, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
