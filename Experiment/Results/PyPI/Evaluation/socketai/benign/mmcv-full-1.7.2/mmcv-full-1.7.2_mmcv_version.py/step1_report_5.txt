  "purpose": "Define version information and parse version strings into structured tuples.",
  "sources": "Reading the module-level variable '__version__' and input argument 'version_str' in 'parse_version_info'.",
  "sinks": "The output of 'parse_version_info' function returning a tuple; no data flows into sinks that could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Input from '__version__' and 'version_str' -> processing in 'parse_version_info' -> output tuples.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of standard version parsing library ('packaging.version'). No obfuscated code or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and a function to parse version info into tuples. It uses standard libraries and straightforward assertions. No external data is fetched or sent. No suspicious or malicious code constructs are present. The logic is typical for version handling. No anomalies or malware-like behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard version parsing and variable definition without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and contains no suspicious activity.",
