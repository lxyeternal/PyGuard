  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports conclude that the code is a straightforward, standard version parsing utility.\n- They emphasize the absence of malicious activity, suspicious code, or security risks.\n- The sources, sinks, and flows are benign, involving only internal version string parsing.\n- No anomalies, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, security risk of 0, and high confidence (1).\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Code's Behavior:\n- The code uses `packaging.version.parse` to parse version strings, which is a well-established, safe library.\n- The function `parse_version_info` handles prerelease and postrelease info properly.\n- The `__version__` string is static and hardcoded; `version_info` is derived from it.\n- No external input is taken dynamically apart from the function parameter, which is safely handled.\n- No system calls, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are detected.\n\n### Logical and Security Evaluation:\n- The logic is straightforward and safe.\n- No evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n- The code's purpose is purely to parse and represent version information.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned by all reports seem reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- The code is a benign, standard version parsing utility.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The detailed analysis confirms that the code is safe and does not pose any threat.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's behavior.",
