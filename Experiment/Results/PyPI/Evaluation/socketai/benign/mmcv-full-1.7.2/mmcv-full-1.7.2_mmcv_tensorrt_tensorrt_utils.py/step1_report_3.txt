{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for converting ONNX models to TensorRT engines, saving/loading engines, and wrapping engines for inference in PyTorch.",
  "sources": "Data is read from ONNX models (load), serialized/deserialized TensorRT engines (save/load), and model inputs during inference in the TRTWrapper.forward method.",
  "sinks": "Serialized engine data written to disk, deserialized back into engine objects, and inference outputs returned as tensors. No data leaks or malicious sinks observed.",
  "flows": "ONNX model loaded and processed, then converted to a TensorRT engine, serialized and saved; engines are loaded from disk, wrapped, and used for inference, with outputs generated as tensors.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated deprecation warnings embedded in functions, but no suspicious code such as hidden network calls, credential handling, or backdoors. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles model conversion, serialization, and inference wrapping with clear and standard API calls. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or malicious system modifications are present. Deprecation warnings are informational. The code uses standard libraries and practices. No anomalies indicating malicious intent. It performs model deployment tasks securely and transparently.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for ONNX to TensorRT conversion and model inference. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The deprecation warnings suggest future updates but do not introduce security concerns.",
