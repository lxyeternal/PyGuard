{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and classes to convert ONNX models to TensorRT engines, save/load engines, and wrap engines into a PyTorch module for inference.",
  "sources": "Reads ONNX models, TensorRT engine files, input shape dictionaries, and model data from files or variables.",
  "sinks": "Serializes engines to disk, potentially deserializes engines from disk, and executes inference using TensorRT runtime, which involves data pointers and device memory operations.",
  "flows": "Input data (model files, shape parameters) -> ONNX parsing and engine building -> engine serialization/deserialization -> inference execution with inputs and outputs handling.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated deprecation warnings embedded in output messages; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious strings; no obfuscated code patterns; standard use of third-party libraries; normal data flow for model deployment.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical deployment utility for ONNX and TensorRT, including conversion, serialization, deserialization, and inference wrapper. It uses standard practices for handling engine files and inference context. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. Warnings about deprecation are informational and do not impact security. Usage of third-party libraries is appropriate for the purpose. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code structures are identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a deployment and inference utility for ONNX models with TensorRT, containing no malicious intent. It performs expected operations related to model conversion, saving, loading, and inference wrapping. No evidence of malware or security risks was found.",
