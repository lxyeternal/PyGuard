  "purpose": "Utility functions and classes for converting ONNX models to TensorRT engines, serializing/deserializing engines, and wrapping engines for inference within PyTorch.",
  "sources": "Model files (ONNX models), input shape dictionaries, engine files on disk, input tensors for inference.",
  "sinks": "Serialization output to disk, deserialization from disk, inference outputs, warnings for deprecation.",
  "flows": "Loading ONNX model -> preprocessing -> parsing with TensorRT -> building engine -> serializing to disk; loading engine from disk -> creating inference context -> executing inference -> returning outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of deprecation warnings; typo in class name 'TRTWraper' instead of 'TRTWrapper'; no suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard deployment utility for ONNX to TensorRT conversion, engine serialization/deserialization, and inference wrapping. No malicious behavior, network activity, or obfuscation patterns are present. Warnings are benign notices about deprecation. The typo in 'TRTWraper' is a minor code quality issue but does not impact security. The code uses common libraries and patterns consistent with deployment workflows. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks are detected. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting typical deployment utility risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign deployment utility for ONNX to TensorRT conversion and inference. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal. The current scores are accurate and appropriate.",
