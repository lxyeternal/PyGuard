  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python regex library with C extensions.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file, defines package metadata, specifies modules, and references C source files for extension compilation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Reads static README file -> sets package metadata -> compiles C extensions -> completes setup process.",
  "anomalies": "No dynamic code, obfuscated patterns, or suspicious behaviors; references to C source files are standard for extensions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup.py script for a Python package with C extensions. It reads a README file, defines package metadata, modules, and extension sources. No runtime data processing, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The inclusion of C source files is standard for performance extensions. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate, with the slight risk reflecting the presence of C source files, which is common and not inherently risky. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores are justified and consistent with the static, well-understood nature of the script. No modifications are necessary.",
