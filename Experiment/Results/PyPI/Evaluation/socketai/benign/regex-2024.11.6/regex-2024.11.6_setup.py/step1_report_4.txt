  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'regex', providing package metadata, descriptions, and extension modules.",
  "sources": "File reading for 'README.rst'; package and module definitions; extension module compilation from C source files.",
  "targets": "No explicit use of untrusted input data; static package metadata. No input or data processing observed.",
  "flows": "N/A – No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only static configuration and file reading.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The script performs standard package setup tasks. No obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools. It reads a README file for long description, defines package metadata, classifiers, dependencies, and extension modules compiled from C source files. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code flows. All code appears to be typical for package distribution without any signs of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate package setup script with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected setup tasks without any suspicious behaviors.",
