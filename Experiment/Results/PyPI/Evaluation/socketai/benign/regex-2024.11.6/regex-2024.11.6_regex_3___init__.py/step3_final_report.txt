  "purpose": "Re-export symbols from the local 'regex' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Reads from the relative module '.regex' via 'from .regex import *' and 'import .regex'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code only performs module re-export.",
  "flows": "Imports all symbols from '.regex' and assigns '__all__' to 'regex.__all__', establishing a source-to-export flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can cause namespace pollution; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward re-export pattern, importing all symbols from a local module and setting '__all__' accordingly. No data flows from untrusted sources, no network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged but common in package '__init__.py' files for re-exports. No security vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a minimal security risk score reflecting the 'import *' pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module re-export with no malicious or security concerns. The use of 'import *' is a stylistic choice that does not introduce security risks in this context. The scores across reports are consistent and justified.",
