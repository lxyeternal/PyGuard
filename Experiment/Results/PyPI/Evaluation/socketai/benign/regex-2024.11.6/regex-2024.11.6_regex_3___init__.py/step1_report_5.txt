{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a local 'regex' module and assigns its '__all__' attribute to the module's '__all__' variable, effectively exposing the 'regex' module's public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: 'from .regex import *' and 'from . import regex'. These are static imports from the package's own modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data, external network communication, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing local modules to setting the '__all__' variable; no data flow from untrusted sources is observable.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be considered poor practice, but is not inherently malicious; no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward module imports and sets the public API exposure. The use of relative imports and 'import *' is typical in Python packages. No malicious behavior or security issues are apparent. The code is minimal and does not perform any operations that could be exploited or cause harm.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
