{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to import all contents from a local 'regex' module and set the __all__ attribute to control what is exported.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from .regex import *' and 'import regex'",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code only performs imports and assigns __all__",
  "flows": "Imports data from local modules; no untrusted data flows to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' is generally discouraged as it can obscure imported content; however, this alone is not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a sibling module 'regex' using 'from .regex import *', which could introduce namespace pollution. It also explicitly imports the 'regex' module itself, then sets the module's __all__ attribute to 'regex.__all__', potentially exposing all symbols defined in 'regex'. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as code execution, data leaks, or backdoors. The structure is typical for modules aiming to re-export symbols from a submodule, though the use of 'import *' is a potential concern for code clarity and maintenance, not security.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard import operations to re-export symbols from a local module. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The use of 'import *' is not best practice but does not imply malicious behavior.",
