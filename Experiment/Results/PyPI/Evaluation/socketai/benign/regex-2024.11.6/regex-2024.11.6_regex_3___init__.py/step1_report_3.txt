{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be setting up imports for a module, likely related to regex functionalities, and defining what symbols to export.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing all symbols from a local 'regex' module and from a relative module '.regex'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; only module imports and an assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and adheres to common module import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a relative 'regex' module and also imports the module itself. It then sets '__all__' to expose symbols from the 'regex' module. The structure is simple and typical for module initialization files. There are no suspicious behaviors, code injections, or hidden functionalities. No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and export setup with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
