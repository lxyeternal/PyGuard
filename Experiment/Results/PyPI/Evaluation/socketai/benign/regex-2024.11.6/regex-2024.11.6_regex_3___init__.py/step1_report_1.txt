  "purpose": "Re-exporting symbols from a local module named 'regex' to make them available at the current package level.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .regex import *' and 'import .regex'",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "The import of all symbols from '.regex' module to the current namespace; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can be considered unusual or risky as it obscures imported symbols, but it is a common pattern for re-exporting modules. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a relative import of all symbols from a module named 'regex' within the same package, then sets '__all__' to the '__all__' attribute of the imported module. This is a standard re-export pattern in Python to control the public API of the package. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, data leaks, or hidden behaviors. The use of 'import *' can be considered less ideal but not inherently malicious. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module re-export with no malicious intent or security risks. It is standard package structure code to facilitate API management.",
