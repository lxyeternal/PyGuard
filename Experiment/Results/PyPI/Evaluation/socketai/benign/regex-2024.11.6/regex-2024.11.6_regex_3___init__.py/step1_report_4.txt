{
  "purpose": "Re-exports contents of the 'regex' module, likely for easier access or API management.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from .regex import *' and 'from . import regex'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; the code only performs import operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only establishes module references.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can obscure imported symbols, but not inherently malicious. No other suspicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from the local 'regex' module using 'from .regex import *', then re-imports the module as 'regex', and sets '__all__' to expose the 'regex' module's '__all__'. This pattern is common for module re-exports, facilitating API design. There are no indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. The use of 'import *' can be discouraged for clarity but is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module re-export pattern with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It does not perform any data processing or network operations that could pose security risks.",
