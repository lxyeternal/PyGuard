{
  "purpose": "The code downloads Unicode data ZIP if needed, parses multiple Unicode data files, and generates static C code for regex Unicode property support, including property tables, case folding, normalization, and lookup functions.",
  "sources": "Reads from local files within the ZIP archive, downloads the ZIP from unicode.org if absent or outdated.",
  "sinks": "Writes large static data tables, lookup functions, and header files for regex engine integration.",
  "flows": "Data flows from network download or local ZIP extraction into in-memory data structures, then into static C code and headers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, no embedded malicious payloads. Network activity is limited to a trusted Unicode.org download.",
  "analysis": "The script performs systematic Unicode data parsing, range management, and code generation for regex properties. It uses standard libraries, no eval or system calls, and maintains clear data flow. The network activity is solely a download from a trusted source. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose aligns with Unicode support in regex engines, and the data handling is consistent with legitimate Unicode processing tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Unicode data parser and C code generator for regex Unicode properties. It performs no malicious actions, contains no obfuscation, and the network activity is standard and safe. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and accurate.",
