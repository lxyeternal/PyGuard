{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS RDS and related service constants to enable type safety and better code documentation.",
  "sources": "The code sources string literals from the module's own definitions, including type annotations and optional conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted or external input are present; the code does not perform any data processing, I/O, or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely declarative, defining types.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns observed. The code uses conditional import for compatibility and straightforward type definitions. No hardcoded secrets or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on defining string literal types for various AWS RDS related constants, service names, regions, waiters, and paginator names. It employs conditional import to maintain compatibility with different Python versions. The structure is consistent and adheres to standard type hinting practices. There are no signs of obfuscated code, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The code is static, purely declarative, and designed for type safety, with no external data processing or network activity involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a safe, static module defining AWS service constants with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves as a type-safe reference for other modules. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected.",
