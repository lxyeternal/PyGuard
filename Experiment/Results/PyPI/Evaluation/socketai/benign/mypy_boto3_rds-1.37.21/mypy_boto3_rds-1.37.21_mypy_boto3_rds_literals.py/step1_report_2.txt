  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various AWS RDS service literal values using Python type hints for improved code correctness and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Reading type annotations and string literals defining allowed values for AWS RDS parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code solely defines literals and imports for type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; mainly static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. Usage of conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed entirely of static string literal definitions for various AWS RDS and related service parameters, using 'Literal' from the typing module or typing_extensions. The import pattern is standard for compatibility. No dynamic code execution, external data input, or suspicious behavior is observed. There are no functions, network operations, or environment variable accesses. The comments and structure suggest this is a type definition module intended for type safety, not runtime logic. The inclusion of a 'Copyright 2025' note appears to be a placeholder or typo but does not impact code security.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a static type definition file providing AWS RDS related string literals for type checking. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, benign utility module with no signs of supply chain attacks or sabotage.",
