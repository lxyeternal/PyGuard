  "purpose": "Define type literals for various AWS RDS service parameters and related constants for type checking and code validation.",
  "sources": "Imports sys and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions; definitions of string literal types for AWS RDS parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed; all definitions are static type annotations and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines type literals without data processing or external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code consists solely of static string literal type definitions and conditional import logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, which is standard practice for compatibility. It then defines multiple string literal types representing various AWS RDS service parameters, statuses, and constants. All definitions are static, well-structured, and lack any dynamic or external input handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code's purpose is purely to provide type annotations for better code validation and developer assistance.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard set of type literals for AWS RDS service parameters, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It functions as a type-safe constants repository for use with static type checkers.",
