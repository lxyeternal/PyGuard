  "purpose": "Static type definitions for AWS RDS service literals, providing type safety and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Static string literals defined directly in the code, with conditional import for 'Literal' based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "None; the code contains no data input, output, or external data processing.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static declarations with no suspicious patterns or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of static string literal type annotations for various AWS RDS parameters, statuses, waiters, regions, and service names. It uses standard practices for compatibility and contains no dynamic code, external input, network activity, or secrets. The purpose is solely to enhance static type checking and IDE support. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and serves as a static utility for type safety. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
