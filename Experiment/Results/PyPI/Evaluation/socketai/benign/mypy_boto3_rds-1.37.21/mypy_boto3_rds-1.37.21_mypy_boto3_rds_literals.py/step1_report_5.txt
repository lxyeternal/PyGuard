{
  "purpose": "Define type literals for AWS RDS service parameters and related constants for type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Type annotations for various RDS-related string literals, imported conditionally from typing or typing_extensions depending on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No data is processed or passed to external systems; no untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no dynamic data flows or untrusted data paths; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward type aliasing for literals.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static string literal definitions used for type annotations in a larger codebase. The conditional import of 'Literal' is standard practice for compatibility. No runtime data handling, network communication, or external I/O occurs. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code is consistent with a documentation and type safety module, with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign set of type alias definitions for AWS RDS literals, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It serves to improve code quality and type checking in the larger project, with no suspicious activity or security concerns.",
