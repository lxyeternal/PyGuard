  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code defines static type literals for AWS RDS parameters.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurately states that the code is purely static, with no dynamic or external data handling, and no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Risk = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification for scores:** Given the code's nature, these scores are reasonable.\n- **Additional notes:** The mention of \"Copyright 2025\" appears to be a placeholder or typo but doesn't impact security.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the static string literals and standard import pattern.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, external input, or obfuscation. The note about the 2025 copyright is a typo or placeholder.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Risk = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The code is purely declarative, serving as a type annotation utility.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the static definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic code, network activity, or external data processing. No malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Risk = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0 — justified.\n- **Additional notes:** The pattern remains consistent with previous reports.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; accurate.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data flow.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Risk = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0 — justified.\n- **Additional notes:** The license comment and version check are standard.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is static, purely type definitions, with no runtime or external activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Risk = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.0 — justified.\n- **Additional notes:** No suspicious patterns.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a static set of type literal definitions for AWS RDS parameters, with conditional import for compatibility.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign 0.0, which aligns with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- **Security Risk:** No external input, no dynamic code, no secrets, no network activity.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no security risk or supply chain attack evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a benign, well-structured static type definition module for AWS RDS literals. All reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Estimated Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware            | 0.0                   |\n| Obfuscated         | 0.0                   |\n| Security Risk      | 0.0                   |\n\nThis module poses no security threat, and its purpose is purely to aid static type checking.",
