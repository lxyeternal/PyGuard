  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static collection of type literals for AWS RDS parameters.\n- No external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The conditional import pattern for 'Literal' is standard for compatibility.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- The purpose is solely to provide type safety and improve IDE support.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is a straightforward static type definition module.\n- No issues with the code's logic, structure, or security posture.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The \"Copyright 2025\" note appears to be a typo or placeholder, but it doesn't impact security or functionality.\n- No other logical flaws or security concerns are evident.\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — Correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — Correct; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — Correct; no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is purely declarative.\n- The extensive list of literals and the conditional import are standard practices.\n- No suspicious patterns or behaviors detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the detailed review, **the provided reports are accurate**. The code is benign, well-structured, and serves a clear purpose in static type checking.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a safe, static set of type literals for AWS RDS parameters, with no malicious or security concerns. It functions as intended for type safety and developer support.",
