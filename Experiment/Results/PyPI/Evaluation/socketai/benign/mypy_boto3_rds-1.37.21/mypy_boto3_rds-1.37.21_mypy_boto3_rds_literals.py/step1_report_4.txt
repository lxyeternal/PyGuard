{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS RDS service literals and related constants for type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Import of sys module, conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data flows; the code only defines constants and type aliases.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only establishes type literals and does not process data or execute logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors. The code includes a license comment, version check for compatibility, and extensive type literal definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for various AWS RDS related string literals using Literal, with a version check for compatibility with Python 3.12+ and fallback to typing_extensions. It defines numerous constant types representing possible string values for AWS API parameters, waiters, regions, and other enumerations. The structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code, external input, or side effects. No suspicious or malicious code segments are present. The license and documentation links indicate open-source intent, and no obfuscated or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely a set of type definitions for AWS RDS service literals, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a well-structured, benign utility module for type safety. No malware or security threats are evident.",
