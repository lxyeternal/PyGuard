  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for interacting with AWS RDS service, providing method signatures and documentation links.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, typing, botocore modules, local modules (.paginator, .type_defs, .waiter), and method signatures with parameters and return types.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations such as generate_presigned_url, create, delete, modify, describe, and control operations which handle input parameters and return types; no direct untrusted data sinks or network actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (kwargs) unpacked from type definitions into methods; method calls follow AWS API conventions with no evidence of external data flows to malicious destinations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected. The code consists mainly of type annotations, method signatures, and documentation references.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a structured client class for AWS RDS, with detailed method signatures, type annotations, and documentation links. No runtime behavior, dynamic code execution, or external data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The extensive use of type hints and overloads aims to enhance type safety and IDE support. There are no indications of malicious intent such as network communication to unknown domains, data theft, or backdoors. The code appears to be a well-structured, type-annotated SDK interface without malicious or sabotage elements.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard, type-annotated interface for AWS RDS, designed to aid in static type checking and IDE autocompletion. It contains no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. Its purpose is purely to define method signatures and documentation links for the boto3 RDS client with type hints, with no suspicious or malicious components detected.",
