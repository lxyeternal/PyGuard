{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations, class structures, method signatures, and overloads for the AWS boto3 RDS client, serving as a static type stub to facilitate static analysis, IDE support, and type checking.",
  "sources": "The code sources are primarily static method signatures, class definitions, import statements, and type annotations. No runtime data input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs at runtime. The code is purely declarative, providing type hints without executing logic.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks exist, as the code only declares method signatures and type annotations without runtime logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscation, malicious code, backdoors, or unusual constructs are present. The code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive static type stub for the boto3 RDS client, including class definitions, method signatures, overloads, and detailed type annotations. It does not contain executable logic, dynamic code, or external data handling. The purpose is to improve static analysis and IDE support. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The code's static nature and extensive documentation links further confirm its benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured static type stub for the AWS boto3 RDS client. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The high confidence in safety is justified, and there are no security risks or malware present.",
