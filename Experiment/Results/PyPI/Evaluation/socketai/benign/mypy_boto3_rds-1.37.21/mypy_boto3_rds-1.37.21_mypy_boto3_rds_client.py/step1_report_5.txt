{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for boto3 RDS service, providing method signatures, type hints, and pagination/waiter overloads.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; overload functions for get_paginator and get_waiter.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows include method parameters unpacked from type definitions, and property/method returns. No untrusted input sources or external data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "Method parameters unpacked from predefined type definitions, with no indication of data from external untrusted sources; method implementations are placeholders, not actual logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. All methods are standard interface signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive type-annotated interface for the boto3 RDS client, including exception classes, method signatures, property definitions, and overloads for pagination and waiters. The structure aligns with standard SDK interface definitions. No malicious behaviors such as network connections, file access, or data exfiltration code are present. The code appears to be an auto-generated or manually maintained type stub meant for static analysis or type checking, not runtime logic. It contains no data handling or external interactions that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, well-structured type stub for boto3's RDS client. It does not include any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is solely for type hinting and documentation, with no active code that could compromise security.",
