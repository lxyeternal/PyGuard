  "purpose": "Type annotations and class interface for the boto3 RDS client, providing type hints and method signatures for interacting with Amazon RDS.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and internal modules; class attribute definitions; method definitions with parameters and return types; overloads for get_paginator and get_waiter.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that interact with AWS services, including actions like creating, deleting, describing, and modifying RDS resources, which could potentially be misused if exploited, but are standard API interactions.",
  "flows": "Method calls receive kwargs unpacked from type definitions, which are passed to AWS service operations; no untrusted input processing or data flow to external systems is explicitly shown in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, malicious code, or hidden backdoors; the code is purely interface/type hint definitions for a well-known AWS SDK with no suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides type annotations, method signatures, and overloads for the boto3 RDS client, enabling static type checking and IDE support. It includes exception class definitions and properties for exception handling. All methods correspond to AWS RDS API actions and use standard patterns such as kwargs unpacking from type definitions. No evidence of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The content appears to be auto-generated or hand-crafted interface definitions, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or sensitive data handling. The presence of comprehensive method signatures and type overloads indicates focus on type safety and API correctness, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static interface definition for the AWS boto3 RDS client with extensive type annotations, overloads, and exception handling classes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It functions solely as a type hinting layer to support static analysis and IDE features. Overall, it appears safe and intended for development tooling rather than malicious activity.",
