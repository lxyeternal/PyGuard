  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a static string, serving as a source of truth for versioning.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static assignment without external input or output.",
  "anomalies": "Future copyright year (2025) is unusual but not suspicious or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a version string with a comment. No dynamic code, input reading, external data, or code execution present. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The future year in the comment is likely a typo or placeholder, not security concern. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version declaration with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No modifications needed.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
