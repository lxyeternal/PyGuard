  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code simply assigns a static string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no dynamic behaviors, no input/output handling, no external data sources, and no code execution.\n   - The code includes a comment and a copyright notice, which are standard.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No report indicates any suspicious or malicious code.\n   - The version string is static and hardcoded.\n   - The copyright year is set to 2025, which is a future date, but this alone is not suspicious; it could be a placeholder or a typo, but it does not impact security.\n\n3. **Obfuscation & Anomalies:**\n   - No obfuscation is present.\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.\n   - The code is straightforward and minimal.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n5. **Potential Risks & Assumptions:**\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n   - Since no dynamic or external elements are involved, the risk of malicious activity is negligible.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct, no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct, code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 (correct, no vulnerabilities or security issues identified)\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The only minor point is the future year in the copyright notice, which could be a typo or placeholder, but it does not impact security.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the evidence, I agree with the reports' scores and assessments. The code is a standard, harmless version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns.\n\n**My final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current analysis and the code's simplicity.",
