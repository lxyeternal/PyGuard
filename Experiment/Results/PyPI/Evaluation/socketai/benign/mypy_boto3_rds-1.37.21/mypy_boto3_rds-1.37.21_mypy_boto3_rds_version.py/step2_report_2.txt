  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code is a straightforward assignment of a static version string to `__version__`.\n   - It includes a comment block indicating the source of truth for the version.\n   - The copyright year is set to 2025, which is in the future but not inherently suspicious.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No dynamic code, external data reads, or data flows are present.\n   - No obfuscation, code execution, or external communication.\n   - The version string is static and hardcoded.\n   - The code does not handle untrusted data or perform any operations beyond assigning a string.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is a standard version declaration.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior are identified.\n   - The confidence level is high (1.0 or 1), indicating certainty in the benign nature.\n   - Malware scores are all zero, aligning with the assessment that there is no malicious activity.\n   - Security risk scores are zero, which is appropriate given the simplicity and safety of the code.\n\n4. **Score Justification & Recommendations**:\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct; no malicious activity is detected.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is also correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The overall security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns & Clarifications**:\n   - The only unusual aspect is the future copyright year (2025). This is not suspicious but might be worth noting as a possible typo or placeholder.\n   - Since the code is static and simple, there's no need to adjust scores.\n\n6. **Final Assessment**:\n   - Based on the code and reports, the scores are appropriate.\n   - No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a typical version declaration with no malicious or security issues.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are correctly assigned as zero.\n- The confidence levels are justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Security Risk**: 0\n\nThe code appears entirely benign and standard.",
