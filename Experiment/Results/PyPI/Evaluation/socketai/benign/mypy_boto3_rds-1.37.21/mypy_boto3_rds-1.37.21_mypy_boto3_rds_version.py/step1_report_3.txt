  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only assigns a static string",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the copyright notice is standard, and the version string appears static and legitimate",
  "analysis": "The code sets a __version__ variable to a string '1.37.21'. It includes a copyright notice with a future date (2025), which is unusual but not malicious. There are no inputs, no data reading, no dynamic code, and no suspicious behavior. It is a straightforward version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version assignment with a copyright notice. No malicious intent or security issues are detected.",
