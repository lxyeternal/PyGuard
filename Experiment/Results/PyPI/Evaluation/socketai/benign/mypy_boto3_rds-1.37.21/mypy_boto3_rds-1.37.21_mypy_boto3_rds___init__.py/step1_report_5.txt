{
  "purpose": "Provides a structured interface for interacting with AWS RDS service, including client creation, waiters, and paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter) and defines constants for AWS service interactions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly initializes classes and constants for AWS API interactions.",
  "flows": "Imports modules -> defines classes/constants -> creates client instance -> provides access to waiters and paginators.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code primarily consists of boilerplate setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions related to AWS RDS service, including waiters and paginators. It defines a client alias and exports all imported elements via __all__. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a well-structured SDK wrapper or interface layer for AWS RDS, with no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. All parts are standard for SDK setup and module exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for AWS RDS interactions, with no malicious or suspicious features. It merely re-exports SDK components, which is typical in SDK wrapper packages. No malicious intent detected.",
