  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the code snippet accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code provides an interface for AWS RDS SDK components, importing from local modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows or sinks involving untrusted data are present.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. The code is purely structural, setting up SDK wrappers.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that this is a standard SDK interface with no security issues is justified. The confidence score of 0.95 is appropriate given the thorough reasoning.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both are correctly 0, as no malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, correctly notes the code's role as an SDK wrapper.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior. The code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid conclusion that this is a clean, standard SDK setup. The confidence score of 1 is justified due to the clear, unambiguous nature of the code.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Correctly 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; it describes the code as an SDK interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data processing or sensitive data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code is boilerplate.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified conclusion that this is a legitimate SDK setup. Confidence score of 1 is appropriate.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both correctly 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as an SDK interface.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows involving untrusted sources.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion is consistent with the code's nature; confidence score of 1 is appropriate.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both 0, as expected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes the code as a setup module.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid conclusion; confidence score of 1 is justified.\n\n**Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** Both correctly 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code snippets are purely SDK interface setup code, importing classes, functions, and defining constants for AWS RDS SDK interaction.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent across all reports.\n- **Security Risks:** None identified; the code is standard SDK wrapper code.\n- **Scores Consistency:** All malware and obfuscated scores are correctly assigned as 0, and risk scores are appropriately low (0), given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis code is a typical, legitimate SDK interface module with no security concerns.",
