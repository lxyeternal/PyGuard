{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for interacting with AWS RDS services, including client creation, waiters, and paginators for various RDS operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter), which define classes and functions for AWS service interactions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains sinks where untrusted data could lead to security vulnerabilities directly; it mainly defines classes, functions, and constants.",
  "flows": "The code imports and defines references to AWS SDK components. There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily consists of standard class and function definitions for AWS SDK wrappers. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports and re-exports classes and functions related to AWS RDS SDK interactions, including clients, paginators, and waiters. It does not execute any logic or handle external data input. All references seem to be straightforward SDK wrappers and type annotations. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious code patterns. The comments and structure suggest this is a typical SDK interface setup for managing RDS resources.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, legitimate SDK interface module for AWS RDS services. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply re-exports classes and functions for user convenience. No indications of malware or security threats are present.",
