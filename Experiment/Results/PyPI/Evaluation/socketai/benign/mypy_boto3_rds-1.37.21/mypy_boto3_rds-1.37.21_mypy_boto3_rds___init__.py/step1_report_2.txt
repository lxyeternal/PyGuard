{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface and import definitions for interacting with AWS RDS services through a Python SDK, including clients, waiters, and paginators.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter). No external data inputs or user inputs are processed within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or sensitive information. The code defines class and function references for later use.",
  "flows": "Initialization of client and waiters/paginators, then exporting these objects for external use. No data flow from untrusted sources is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be straightforward API interface definitions. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, class and function assignments, and module exports. It imports various classes and functions from local modules, which define AWS SDK components for RDS. The naming conventions align with standard AWS SDK practices. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious logic appears present. The absence of dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or network operations indicates a low likelihood of malicious intent. The purpose is purely to expose API interface objects.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a clean interface layer for AWS RDS SDK components with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs standard imports and exports, providing structure for SDK usage. No security risks are identified within this module.",
