{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for AWS RDS SDK components, importing classes, functions, and constants from local modules for use in managing RDS resources.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator, .waiter) and constants definitions within the module.",
  "sinks": "No data flows from untrusted sources; primarily class and function references for SDK setup.",
  "flows": "Static imports and definitions without dynamic data or external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward SDK wrapper setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard SDK interface module, importing necessary classes and functions for AWS RDS management. It does not process external data, execute dynamic code, or contain any malicious patterns. The structure is typical for SDK setup, with clear separation of imports and exports. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly set to 0, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK wrapper for AWS RDS, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities detected. It serves as a setup module for AWS SDK components, and the analysis confirms its safety.",
