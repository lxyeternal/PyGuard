{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for AWS RDS service client, enabling type-safe pagination of API responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads no untrusted input; it mainly defines class structures, type annotations, and method signatures for paginators. No external data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to files, send data over the network, or execute external commands. It only defines methods for pagination with parameters passed through kwargs.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling 'paginate' methods with keyword arguments, which would typically include untrusted data if provided externally, but as written, this is just type definitions. No actual data processing or flow control indicates malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated, heavily focused on type definitions, class inheritance, and documentation links. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. No obfuscated language features or dynamic execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines paginator classes for the boto3 RDS client, utilizing type annotations and documentation links for clarity. It uses conditional imports for compatibility, and each paginator class provides a 'paginate' method with specified parameters. No suspicious code, such as network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution, is present. The structure suggests generated boilerplate code intended for static type checking rather than runtime malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a comprehensive set of paginator class definitions for the RDS client, focused on type safety and documentation. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and intended solely for type annotations and API response pagination support.",
