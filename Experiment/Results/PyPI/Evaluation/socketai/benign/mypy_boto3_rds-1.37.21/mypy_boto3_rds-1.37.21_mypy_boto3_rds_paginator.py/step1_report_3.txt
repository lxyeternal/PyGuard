  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for AWS RDS service client, facilitating paginated API calls with type safety.",
  "sources": "Imports from botocore.paginate, type definitions from .type_defs, system version check for typing extensions, and the entire class and function definitions for paginators.",
  "sinks": "The paginate methods that accept arbitrary keyword arguments and return PageIterator objects; no external data sinks or data leaks are directly evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to paginate methods flow into AWS API calls managed by the Paginator base class, resulting in paginated responses; no untrusted data flows into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code follows a consistent pattern for paginator classes with proper type annotations. No suspicious network calls, file operations, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated and structured set of paginator class definitions for AWS RDS, with conditional imports for typing support, and explicit type annotations for static type checking. Each class inherits from a generic Paginator, with paginate methods designed to accept various AWS request parameters and return response page iterators. There are no signs of malicious logic, secret handling, or obfuscation. The code appears to serve as a type-safe interface for paginated API responses, with no harmful behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, type-annotated set of paginator classes for AWS RDS API, with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It functions as a standard SDK interface layer, and does not perform any suspicious or harmful actions.",
