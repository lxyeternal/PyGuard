  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code provides type annotations and paginators for AWS RDS, mainly boilerplate, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is standard, auto-generated, and contains no malicious logic. The use of class inheritance, type annotations, and documentation links aligns with safe SDK practices.\n- **Risk & Malware Score Justification:** Zero risk and malware scores are justified; no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure, boilerplate code for static analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the code's role as a type-safe interface with no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The detailed description confirms the code's benign nature, with no signs of malicious logic, obfuscation, or secret handling.\n- **Risk & Malware Score Justification:** Zero risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK interface code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the code as a structured, type-annotated set of paginator classes, with no malicious intent.\n- **Assessment:** The detailed analysis aligns with the previous reports. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present.\n- **Risk & Malware Score Justification:** Risk score of 0.1 might be slightly high given the benign nature, but considering the minimal risk (no active data handling or external influence), it's acceptable.\n- **Malware Score:** Zero, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Overall safe, boilerplate code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is boilerplate for boto3 type annotations, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The description matches the pattern of the previous reports, emphasizing the static, generated nature of the code.\n- **Risk & Malware Score Justification:** Zero risk and malware scores are justified; no active or malicious code paths.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely infrastructural code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, highlighting the code as standard, generated, and safe.\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or secret handling.\n- **Risk & Malware Score Justification:** Zero scores are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure, standard type stub code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** The code is purely boilerplate for type annotations and paginator classes. No actual logic, data processing, or external interactions that could be malicious are present.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** All reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as boilerplate, auto-generated, and safe.\n- **Scores & Justifications:**\n  - **Malware:** All reports agree on zero, which is correct.\n  - **Obfuscated:** Zero obfuscation is evident; the code is straightforward.\n  - **Risk:** The risk scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1), reflecting the benign nature.\n  \n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — clear, readable, boilerplate code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no active vulnerabilities or insecure behaviors.\n\n**Note:** The code is standard, auto-generated SDK boilerplate intended for static type checking, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**The code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threat.**",
