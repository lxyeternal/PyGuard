{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and paginators for the RDS service client in boto3, enabling type-safe iteration over paginated API responses.",
  "sources": "The code defines paginator classes that invoke 'client.get_paginator' for various RDS API operations; the 'client' object is created via 'session.client(\"rds\")'.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods return PageIterator objects that internally handle API response data; no untrusted input directly influences these flows. No data leaks or unsafe code execution points are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (kwargs) to 'paginate' methods flow into API calls via 'client.get_paginator' and then into response handling, but there are no external untrusted sources that influence code execution beyond API parameters. The response data is iterated over via PageIterator objects.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be boilerplate for boto3 type annotations with extensive repetitive structure; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. No suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscation is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated set of paginator classes for the boto3 RDS client, using type annotations for static analysis. It defines paginator base classes conditioned on type checking and version, with consistent method signatures. No dynamic code, external data manipulation, or suspicious patterns are present. The structure adheres to standard practices for boto3 type stubs, and all components serve to facilitate type-safe iteration over known API responses. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage mechanisms are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, type-annotated implementation of boto3 RDS paginator classes for static type checking. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is purely infrastructural for type safety in SDK usage.",
