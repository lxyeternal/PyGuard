{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a CLI entrypoint for a Python package, providing version and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and writes to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout; no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "If '--version' is in sys.argv, calls print_version() which outputs version info; otherwise, calls print_info() which outputs package details to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports. The code is straightforward and lacks unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys and defines functions to print package information and version. The main() function checks for a command-line argument '--version' and prints version info if present, otherwise prints package info. There are no external data sources, no input parsing beyond argv, and no network or file operations. The code appears standard and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package info and version. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is negligible.",
