  "purpose": "CLI entrypoint for a package that outputs package information and version details.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout (writes output)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (outputs package info and version)",
  "flows": "Command-line argument in sys.argv triggers print_version(), which outputs version info; otherwise, print_info() outputs package details",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; no obfuscated or dynamic code execution; no external data sources or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple output based on command-line arguments, with functions to print static package info and version. No user input handling beyond sys.argv; no data leaks, external network access, or security-sensitive operations. The content is straightforward and static, with no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI utility that outputs static package information and version details. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks present.",
