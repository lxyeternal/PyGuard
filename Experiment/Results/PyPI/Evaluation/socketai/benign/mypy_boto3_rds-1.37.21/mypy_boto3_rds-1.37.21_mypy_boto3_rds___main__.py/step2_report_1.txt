  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Code Review Summary:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- It uses straightforward sys.argv checks and sys.stdout.write for output.\n- No external data sources, network activity, dynamic code execution, or handling of sensitive data.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious functions, or malicious code patterns.\n- The code appears well-structured, simple, and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are present in the code snippets provided.\n- **Code correctness:** The code functions as intended, with no logical errors affecting security.\n\n### Flaws, Errors, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical errors:** None.\n- **Security flaws:** None.\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious code:** None.\n- **Other mistakes:** None.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct, no obfuscation)\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct, no malicious activity)\n- **Security risk score:** 0 or very close to 0 (minimal, given the code's simplicity)\n\nThe reports assign a malware score of 0 or 0.1, and a security risk of 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the static and benign nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since there's no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities, scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted.\n- The small security risk score of 0.1 in some reports could be due to conservative assumptions, but given the static, read-only nature, it's acceptable.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other, uniformly indicating no malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple CLI utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The static output and straightforward logic confirm its benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **The code is safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation.**  \n- **Scores should remain at 0 for malware and obfuscated, and very close to 0 for security risk.**  \n- **Overall, the supply chain risk is negligible.**",
