  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review & Issue Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package information or version details based on command-line arguments.\n   - There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, secrets, dynamic code execution, or network activity.\n   - The functions are straightforward, and the logic is simple and static.\n   - **Conclusion:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated code.\n   - The reasoning in each report is consistent, emphasizing the static nature of the output and the lack of external data handling.\n   - No inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 or very close to 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a high risk score; all are at or near zero.\n   - The code does not perform any risky operations.\n   - **Conclusion:** No justification for higher risk scores; the current scores are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that there is no malware.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on static analysis.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n   - **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The code is a simple CLI utility with no security concerns.\n- No supply chain risks or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the assessments provided.**",
