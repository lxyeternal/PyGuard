  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate; straightforward CLI info display.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states no malicious behavior, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct; similar to others.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; confirms static output.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the securityRisk is slightly above zero, perhaps due to conservative default or minor concern, but given no actual issues, it might be slightly overestimated.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- Same as above, consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- Same observations; no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- Same reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity, malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores should stay at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is entirely static, benign, and has no security issues, the risk score should be very low, ideally 0.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- The second report assigns a securityRisk of 0.1, which seems slightly conservative but not unreasonable given the context. However, given the code's simplicity, a risk score of 0 would be more accurate.\n- All reports correctly avoid overestimating malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk present)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static information. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present. The reports are consistent with the code's content, though the second report's slight securityRisk of 0.1 could be lowered to 0 for accuracy.\n\n**Final Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms the code is safe and free from supply chain security concerns.",
