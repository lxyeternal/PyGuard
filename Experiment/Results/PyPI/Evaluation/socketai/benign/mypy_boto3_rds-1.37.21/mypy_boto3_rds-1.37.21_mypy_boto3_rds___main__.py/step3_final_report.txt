  "purpose": "A minimal CLI utility that outputs static package info or version based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv for command-line arguments, static strings for output",
  "sinks": "stdout via sys.stdout.write",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (if '--version') leads to print_version output; otherwise, print_info output",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static CLI script that outputs package info or version. It does not process untrusted input beyond argument checking, does not perform network activity, dynamic code execution, or handle sensitive data. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The logic is clear and benign, with functions dedicated to printing static information. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the code's simplicity and static nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify its safe and straightforward nature. The overall supply chain security risk is negligible, and the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
