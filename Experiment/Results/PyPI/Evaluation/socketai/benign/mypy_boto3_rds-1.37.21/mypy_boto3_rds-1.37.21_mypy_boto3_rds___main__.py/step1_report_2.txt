{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a CLI entrypoint for displaying package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 RDS stubs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv, specifically checking for '--version'.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line argument) -> check for '--version' -> print version or package info to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code structures, no dynamic code execution, and no hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys to handle command-line arguments and output. It defines functions to print package info and version. The main function checks for the '--version' argument and responds accordingly. The script executes main() if run as the main module. No external data sources, no untrusted input processing beyond command-line argument checking, and no dangerous or suspicious actions are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that outputs static package information and version. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
