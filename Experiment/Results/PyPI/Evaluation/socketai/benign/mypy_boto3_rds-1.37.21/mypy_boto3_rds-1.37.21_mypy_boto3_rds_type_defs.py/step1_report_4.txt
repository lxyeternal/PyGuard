{
  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS RDS service responses and requests, facilitating type-safe interactions with the AWS SDK.",
  "sources": "Type definitions for request parameters, response data structures, and nested data types, primarily from imports and in-line class/type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or data leaks are present; the code mainly consists of data schemas.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely type/schema definitions without executable logic or data processing flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code contains extensive type definitions and imports for AWS SDK, which are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type annotations, TypedDict definitions, and conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions. It includes no executable code, no dynamic execution, no network or file I/O, and no suspicious logic. The imports are standard for typing and collections, with no indication of obfuscation or malicious code. The data structures define request/response schemas for AWS RDS operations, and there are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden behavior. The license comment and URL point to documentation, consistent with open-source SDK type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a comprehensive set of type definitions for AWS RDS service requests and responses, designed for type safety in Python. It is benign and purely declarative, with no malicious intent or behavior detected. It does not contain executable logic, data leaks, or backdoors.",
