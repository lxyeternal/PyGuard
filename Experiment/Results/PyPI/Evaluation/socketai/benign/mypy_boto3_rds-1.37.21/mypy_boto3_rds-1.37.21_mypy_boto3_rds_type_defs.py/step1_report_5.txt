  "purpose": "Type annotations and data structure definitions for AWS RDS service type definitions, used for data validation and API response handling.",
  "sources": "The code primarily sources data from external AWS API responses, method parameters, and internal type annotations. No direct input reading or external data parsing is present.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks that process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations. It defines data schemas without executing logic or I/O operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows or executable logic pathways; the code only establishes type structures and constants for type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be purely type definitions with extensive use of TypedDict, List, Dict, and Union. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type definitions for structured data used in AWS RDS SDK interactions, including request/response schemas and data models. It employs conditional imports for compatibility with different Python versions. No code execution, network activity, or data processing logic is included. The structure is typical for generated or manually maintained SDK type annotations. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or obfuscation are evident. The purpose is to ensure type safety and clarity for developers interfacing with AWS RDS APIs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a comprehensive set of type annotations for AWS RDS SDK responses and requests, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a standard, well-structured SDK type definition module designed for type safety. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
