  "purpose": "Type annotations for RDS service type definitions to facilitate type checking and validation in Python code interacting with AWS RDS.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard library (sys, datetime, typing), local literals module, and type annotations within TypedDict and Union definitions.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code primarily defines data structures without executing or handling untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code only declares data structures; no data flow logic or execution paths present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data leaks. Usage of type annotations, TypedDict, and conditional imports based on sys.version_info is standard. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a comprehensive set of TypedDict classes for AWS RDS data types, including request/response structures, configurations, and metadata. It uses conditional imports for compatibility across Python versions, which is common practice. No code execution, data handling, or external interactions are present. The structure appears solely for type safety and validation, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS RDS SDK in Python. It contains no malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is purely to provide type annotations for better code correctness and clarity.",
