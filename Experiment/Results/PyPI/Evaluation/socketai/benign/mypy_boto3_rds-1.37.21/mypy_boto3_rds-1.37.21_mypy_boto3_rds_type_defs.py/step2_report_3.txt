  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Reported issues:**  \n   - All reports indicate \"Empty response\" errors, meaning no runtime or malicious activity was detected, only static code analysis.\n   - The reports describe the purpose as defining type annotations and data schemas for AWS RDS SDK interactions, with no executable logic, network activity, or data handling.\n\n2. **Code confirmation:**  \n   - The code is purely composed of `TypedDict`, `Union`, and conditional imports for Python version compatibility.\n   - No executable code, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity.\n   - The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The purpose is clearly to facilitate type checking and validation in Python, which is standard for SDKs or type definition modules.\n\n3. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**  \n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - The only potential concern could be the extensive size and complexity, but given the context (AWS SDK type definitions), this is normal.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors.\n\n4. **Scores and their justification:**  \n   - **Malware score:** 0. Since the code is purely static type definitions with no executable or malicious activity, this score should remain at 0.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques used.\n   - **Risk score:** 0. The code's purpose is purely to define data structures, with no security risks involved.\n\n5. **Potential assumptions or vulnerabilities:**  \n   - All claims about security vulnerabilities are based on static analysis; no assumptions of vulnerabilities are justified given the code's nature.\n   - The extensive use of conditional imports and type annotations is standard and benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   - The reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The overall security risk is also 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n7. **Additional considerations:**  \n   - The code is a comprehensive, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS RDS SDK, with no signs of malicious intent.\n   - No dynamic code, no external data handling, no network activity, no obfuscation.\n\n**Final assessment:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, static set of type annotations and data schemas for AWS RDS SDK interactions. It serves a purely declarative purpose, with no malicious or security-compromising elements. The reports' evaluations are correct and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nI concur with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, well-structured, and free of security risks or malware.",
