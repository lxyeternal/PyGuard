{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the mypy-boto3-rds Python package, providing metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static strings for package metadata; imported modules for setup process.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external output affecting system security.",
  "flows": "Static metadata and file reading flow directly into the setup function without any external untrusted data input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The license, URLs, and author info appear normal for a package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports pathlib and setuptools, reads a README file for description, and calls setup() with package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It follows typical packaging conventions without suspicious behaviors.",
