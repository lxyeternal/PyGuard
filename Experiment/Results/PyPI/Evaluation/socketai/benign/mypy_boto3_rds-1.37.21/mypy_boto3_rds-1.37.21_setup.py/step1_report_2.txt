  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reading file content into LONG_DESCRIPTION, then passing static metadata into setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and the setuptools package for setup. It reads a local README.md file for the long description. The setup() function is called with static, well-formed parameters including package metadata, URLs, and dependencies. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted sources are processed. No code injection, network activity, or malicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
