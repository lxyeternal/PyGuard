{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging and distributing the mypy-boto3-rds Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads the file 'README.md' for long description; reads metadata such as name, version, author, URL, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "The file reads static files and assigns metadata to the setup() function; no dynamic or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; standard setup script with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a markdown file for long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with static package metadata. No user input or untrusted data is processed. The dependencies are specified with environment markers, and all fields appear typical for a package setup. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injection. The script follows common packaging conventions, and all data is static and intended for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is benign and solely used for packaging a Python library. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code.",
