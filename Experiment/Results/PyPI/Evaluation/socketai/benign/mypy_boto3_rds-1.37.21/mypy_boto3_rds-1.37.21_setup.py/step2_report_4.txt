  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Python setup script.\n- No untrusted data sources, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code reads a local README.md file for the long description, which is a common and benign practice.\n- The package metadata, dependencies, URLs, and author info are static and typical.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious constructs, or malicious logic are identified.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code uses `Path` from `pathlib` to read the README.md file, which is safe.\n- The `install_requires` includes a conditional dependency on `typing-extensions`, which is standard.\n- The setup parameters are consistent with typical packaging practices.\n\n**Potential issues or anomalies:**\n- No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected across all reports.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence level of 1 indicates certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\nGiven the comprehensive analysis and agreement among reports, I concur that the code is a benign, standard setup script with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical, well-formed Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent.",
