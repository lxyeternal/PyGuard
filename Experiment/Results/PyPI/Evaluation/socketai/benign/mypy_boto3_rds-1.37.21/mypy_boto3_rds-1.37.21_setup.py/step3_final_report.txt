  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for mypy-boto3-rds, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads local README.md file for long description; static package metadata; no untrusted input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or external data flows; static data used throughout.",
  "flows": "N/A - all data are static; no dynamic flows or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup script with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only standard modules, reads a local file, and calls setup() with fixed parameters. No external inputs, no code execution, no obfuscation, and no network activity are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the script. The confidence level of 1 is justified given the clarity and simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
