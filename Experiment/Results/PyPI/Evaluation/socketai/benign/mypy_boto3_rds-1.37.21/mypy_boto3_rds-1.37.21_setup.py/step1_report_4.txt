  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for packaging the 'mypy-boto3-rds' Python library, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static strings for package metadata; import statements for Path and setuptools.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external data processing identified.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows involving untrusted inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. All code is straightforward setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and uses them to read a markdown file for the long description. It sets up package metadata and dependencies with static values. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. No hardcoded secrets or potentially malicious logic are observed. The code appears to be a standard Python packaging script with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
