  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard Python `setup.py` script for packaging a library.\n- It reads a local README.md for the long description.\n- All data are static, with no user input, environment variables, or external data sources.\n- No network activity, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code imports only standard modules (`pathlib`, `setuptools`) and performs straightforward operations.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes the script as a setup configuration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious activity or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, correctly describes the script.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- Same findings as above, consistent description.\n- **Scores:** all zero, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- Same conclusion: benign, standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** all zero, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- Same as above, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** all zero, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 in all reports. The script is a typical setup script with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical evaluation:**\n\n- The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert estimate:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a typical setup script, with no malicious logic, no obfuscation, and no security risks. All data are static, and there are no external data flows or network activities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. The code is benign and poses no security concerns.",
