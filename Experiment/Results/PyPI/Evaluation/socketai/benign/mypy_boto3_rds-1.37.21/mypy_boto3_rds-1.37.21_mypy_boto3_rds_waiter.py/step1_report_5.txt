  "purpose": "Define type-safe waiters for various RDS resources to facilitate waiting for specific resource states during AWS RDS operations.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'botocore.waiter', type definitions from '.type_defs', sys.version_info for version checking.",
  "sinks": "The 'wait' methods accept untrusted kwargs, which are unpacked into the waiter call, but no direct use of untrusted data in critical security-sensitive contexts.",
  "flows": "kwargs in 'wait' methods are unpacked and passed to the parent 'wait' method of 'Waiter'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code primarily defines classes and methods with straightforward behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple subclasses of 'Waiter', each representing different AWS RDS waiters. The 'wait' methods are overridden but only call the parent 'wait' with unpacked kwargs. The imports are from standard AWS SDK modules and type definitions, with conditional import for 'Unpack'. There is no dynamic code execution, network communication, or other suspicious activity. The code appears to be well-structured and intended solely for type-safe waiter usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type annotations and class definitions for RDS waiters, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is designed to enhance type safety and clarity in AWS RDS resource management. No malicious or security-compromising patterns are detected.",
