  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No, the code is purely class definitions for type annotations.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None identified; the report correctly states the code is benign.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. The risk score seems slightly high for such benign code; perhaps 0.1 is acceptable given the potential for kwargs to include untrusted data, but overall, the code does not process or handle data insecurely.\n- **Justification for risk > 0.5?** Not applicable; score is low.\n- **Malware?** No, the code is purely structural.\n- **Assumptions?** The report correctly dismisses any malicious intent based on the code.\n- **Consistency?** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No, the code is straightforward class wrappers.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The risk score is 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification for higher scores?** Not needed.\n- **Malware?** No.\n- **Assumptions?** Correctly assumes no malicious behavior.\n- **Consistency?** Yes.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. The risk is slightly elevated but justified by the use of **kwargs, which could be misused if the caller supplies malicious data. Still, the code itself does not process or evaluate data.\n- **Justification for >0.5?** Not applicable.\n- **Malware?** No.\n- **Assumptions?** Correct.\n- **Consistency?** Yes.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. Same reasoning as above.\n- **Justification for >0.5?** No.\n- **Malware?** No.\n- **Assumptions?** Correct.\n- **Consistency?** Yes.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** No.\n- **Scores?** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The report assigns zero risk, which is consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Justification for >0.5?** Not applicable.\n- **Malware?** No.\n- **Assumptions?** Correct.\n- **Consistency?** Yes.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as the code contains no malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated (0.1) in most reports, justified by the use of **kwargs that could, in theory, be misused if caller input is malicious. However, the code itself does not process or evaluate this data, and it's standard for SDK wrapper classes.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- The code is benign, purely for type annotations and class definitions.\n- The scores across all reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes needed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with current scores)\n\nThis code is a standard, safe SDK wrapper pattern with no malicious intent or security risk.",
