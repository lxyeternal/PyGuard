  "purpose": "Type annotations for RDS service client waiters, providing static type safety and clearer SDK interface.",
  "sources": "kwargs passed to the wait() methods, which originate from external callers providing parameters for AWS SDK calls.",
  "sinks": "The wait() methods invoke superclass methods with kwargs; no internal data processing or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input kwargs flow directly into the superclass wait() methods without internal processing, representing a simple pass-through.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of class definitions with method signatures for type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses of Waiter, each with a wait() method accepting kwargs typed with imported type definitions. No data manipulation, code execution, or dynamic code is present. The use of Unpack for type annotations is standard and does not introduce security risks. The code is purely structural, serving as type hints for static analysis and IDE support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a set of type-safe wrappers for AWS RDS waiters. It contains no malicious logic, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low risk and malware scores are justified, and the code is safe for use.",
