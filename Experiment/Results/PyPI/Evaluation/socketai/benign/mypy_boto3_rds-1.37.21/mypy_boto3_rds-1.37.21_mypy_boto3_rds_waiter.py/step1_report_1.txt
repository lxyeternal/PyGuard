{
  "purpose": "Define type annotations for various RDS waiter classes to facilitate type checking and IDE support for waiting on RDS resource states.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type definitions; class methods using **kwargs for input parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; methods only call superclass methods with unpacked keyword arguments.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow from method calls via **kwargs into superclass wait methods; no external data sources or untrusted input handling evident.",
  "anomalies": "Code primarily consists of class definitions with straightforward method signatures; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic observed. Use of type annotations and dynamic kwargs is standard for such wrappers.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type-safe wrappers around botocore.waiter.Waiter, defining subclasses for specific RDS waiters. Each class contains a wait method with type annotations based on imported type definitions. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns detected. The implementation aligns with typical SDK wrapper patterns, ensuring type safety without performing any data manipulation or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, well-structured set of class definitions for type annotations of AWS RDS waiters. It contains no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code's purpose is purely to enhance type checking and developer experience, with no indications of malware or security risks.",
