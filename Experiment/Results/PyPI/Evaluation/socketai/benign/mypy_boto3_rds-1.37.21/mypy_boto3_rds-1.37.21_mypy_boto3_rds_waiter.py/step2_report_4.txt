  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Describes type annotations for RDS waiters, with no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** The report correctly identifies that the code is mainly class definitions with type annotations, wrapping boto3 waiters.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1. Given the benign nature, risk score could be slightly higher but still very low.\n- **Assessment:** No issues found. The low risk score seems reasonable.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing type safety and straightforward class wrappers.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Correctly notes that the code is boilerplate for type annotations, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The risk score is appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns; scores align with the code's nature.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the boilerplate nature, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Accurate that the code is mainly class definitions with type annotations, passing kwargs to external API calls.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The low risk is justified.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with emphasis on no malicious behavior.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Correctly states that the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Correctly identifies the code as type annotations and wrapper classes, with no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Perfectly aligned.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0.1) in reports, justified by the code being purely structural with no external data handling or execution.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is a benign, well-structured set of type annotations and wrapper classes for AWS RDS waiters, with no malicious or security risk indicators.",
