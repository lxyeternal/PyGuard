  "purpose": "Type annotations and waiters for RDS service client to facilitate waiting for specific database states.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type definitions. Class method parameters accept untrusted keyword arguments.",
  "sinks": "Method calls to `wait()` with dynamic **kwargs, but no unsafe data handling, external network calls, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Class method `wait()` accepts arbitrary keyword arguments (trusted as per boto3 API) and passes them to the parent class's `wait()` method; no internal data flow of untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of `Unpack` for dynamic type annotations, but no suspicious code or obfuscation patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is mostly boilerplate class definitions for type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple waiter classes for various RDS resource states, extending `Waiter`. Each class's `wait()` method is annotated to accept dynamic keyword arguments with specific types, which is standard for boto3 waiters. The code lacks any system modification, network activity, or data collection outside its API interactions. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are detected. The primary purpose is type hinting and structure, not runtime logic or external data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely boilerplate for type annotations and waiter class definitions for the boto3 RDS client. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It is a standard, well-structured type definition module with no suspicious activity.",
