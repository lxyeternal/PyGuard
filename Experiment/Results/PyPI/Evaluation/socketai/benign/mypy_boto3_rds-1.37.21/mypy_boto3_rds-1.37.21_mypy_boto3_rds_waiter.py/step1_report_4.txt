{
  "purpose": "This code provides type annotations and waiter classes for AWS RDS service clients, enabling type-safe waiting for various database states.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, botocore.waiter, and local type definitions; class method parameters unpacked with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "The wait() methods invoke AWS API waiters with untrusted keyword arguments, but do not process or execute data beyond calling external APIs.",
  "flows": "Untrusted kwargs passed to wait() methods flow directly to AWS API calls via Waiter.wait(), with no intermediate processing or evaluation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No suspicious API calls or data leaks. The code is primarily boilerplate for type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several subclasses of Waiter, each representing a specific AWS RDS waiter, with methods that call the AWS waiters using unpacked kwargs. All dependencies are standard libraries or AWS SDK components, with no indication of malicious behavior. There are no data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoor mechanisms. The focus is on type safety and structured waiter calls. No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations and wrapper classes for AWS RDS waiters, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate helper library for AWS SDK usage.",
