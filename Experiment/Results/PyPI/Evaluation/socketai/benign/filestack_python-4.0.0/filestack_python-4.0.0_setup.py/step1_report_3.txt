{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'filestack-python' SDK package, handling package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the '__version__' variable from 'filestack/__init__.py' to determine package version; reads files for long description.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a local file; no flow of untrusted input to critical functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of regex to extract version info is straightforward; no suspicious or obfuscated code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures: reading version info from a file, configuring package metadata, and specifying dependencies. It uses common Python practices and the 'setuptools' library. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection, are present. The approach to read the version from a local file is typical in setup scripts and does not pose security risks. Overall, the code appears legitimate, well-structured, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected setup operations without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
