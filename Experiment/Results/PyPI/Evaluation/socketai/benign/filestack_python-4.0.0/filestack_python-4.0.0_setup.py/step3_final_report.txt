  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads version info from a local file and configures package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'filestack/__init__.py' using regex; reads static files for description.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks, network activity, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local file and passes it into setup(); no external data flow or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script utilizing common practices. It reads version info via regex from a local file, which is standard and safe. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. Dependencies are explicitly specified and from reputable sources. No obfuscation or malicious code is evident. The regex used for version extraction is a typical pattern and does not introduce security risks. Overall, the script is benign and follows best practices for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no obfuscation or security risks. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a minimal security risk score of 0, given the regex usage is safe and common.",
