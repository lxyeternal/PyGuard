{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for packaging the 'filestack-python' library, including reading version info from a source file and specifying dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'filestack/__init__.py' using open() and re.search(). No external or untrusted input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Uses standard setuptools setup() for package configuration. No sinks that handle untrusted data or external inputs are present.",
  "flows": "Reads version string from source file -> passes version to setup() -> package is configured and built.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual behavior. The code follows typical package setup patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries, reads a version string from a source file with regex, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. The process appears straightforward and typical for Python packaging. No suspicious code, data leaks, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It properly reads version info and sets up package metadata without suspicious activities.",
