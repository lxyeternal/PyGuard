{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'filestack-python' SDK package, primarily for installation and metadata configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading the version from '__init__.py' file; reading package files during setup.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external system interaction during execution.",
  "flows": "Reading version from source file during setup; no external data flow or untrusted input processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations: reading version info, configuring metadata, and dependencies. The 'read' function opens files but does not process untrusted input or execute dynamic code. The version extraction uses regex on a source file, which is typical for version management. No network activity, code injection, or malicious logic appears present. The code structure follows common practices for Python packaging without any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures package metadata and dependencies, adhering to typical practices.",
