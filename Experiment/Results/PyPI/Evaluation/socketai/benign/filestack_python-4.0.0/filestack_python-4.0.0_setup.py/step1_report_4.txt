{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'filestack-python', including metadata, dependencies, and version extraction logic.",
  "sources": "Reading of the version from '__init__.py' file, static string assignments, import statements.",
  "sinks": "None observed. No untrusted data output or external system calls based on this code.",
  "flows": "Read version from file -> use in setup() configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The version reading uses a regex, but that is a typical pattern and appears safe.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files to extract the package version and then configures package setup parameters. There are no external inputs, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns. The dependencies are specified explicitly and are from reputable sources. The code structure follows standard packaging practices, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain any malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided content.",
