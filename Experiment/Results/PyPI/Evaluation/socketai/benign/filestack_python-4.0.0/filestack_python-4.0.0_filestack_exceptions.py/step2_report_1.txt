  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports confirm that the code is a straightforward class definition of a custom exception inheriting from Exception, with no executable logic, data handling, or external calls. There are no indications of issues such as vulnerabilities, malicious code, or obfuscation. This aligns with the original code provided.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code is a benign class definition with no malicious patterns or security concerns. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- Confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Malware: 0\n- Security Risk: 0\n\nThese scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code. Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, the malware score should remain at 0, and the security risk should be minimal.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nNo issues in the code justify a higher risk score. The code is purely a class definition with no runtime behavior, data processing, or external interactions. Therefore, the risk scores are correctly low.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \nAll reports agree that there's no malware present. The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a benign class definition.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\nGiven the consistent analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a simple, benign custom exception class with no security concerns.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code is safe and does not pose any security threat.",
