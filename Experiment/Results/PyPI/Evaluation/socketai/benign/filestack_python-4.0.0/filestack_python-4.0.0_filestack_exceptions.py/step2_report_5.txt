  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition inheriting from `Exception` with a descriptive docstring.\n   - There are no signs of data handling, external calls, or logic that could introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n   - The code is straightforward and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they do not overstate or understate the code's security implications.\n   - They correctly note the absence of anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are identified in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (fully confident in the benign nature)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a class definition with no runtime behavior, data processing, or external dependencies, a high risk score is unwarranted.\n   - The current scores of 0 for malware and security risk are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity is suggested or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the code as benign.\n   - They do not speculate about potential vulnerabilities or malicious intent where none exists.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The high confidence and zero risk/malware scores align with the benign, straightforward class definition.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and appropriately rated.**\n\n---\n\n### My personal estimate:\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious or malicious patterns, I concur with the current scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**No changes are necessary.**",
