  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The code defines a class `FilestackHTTPError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - It contains a descriptive docstring referencing a GitHub pull request.\n   - The class is empty, serving as a custom exception for HTTP errors related to Filestack.\n   - There are no methods, data handling, or external interactions.\n\n2. **Issue Presence:**\n   - The code does **not** include any logic, data processing, or data sinks.\n   - It is purely a class definition meant to be used elsewhere.\n   - No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that this is a straightforward, benign class definition.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks.\n   - The references to a GitHub pull request in the docstring are appropriate and do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n   - **Confidence:** 1, as the analysis is consistent and accurate.\n   \n   Given the simplicity and benign nature, these scores seem reasonable.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume the class is used correctly elsewhere; since the code is only a class definition, this is reasonable.\n   - No hidden malicious behavior can be inferred from this snippet alone.\n\n6. **Final Justification:**\n   - Since the code is just a class definition with no executable logic, no data handling, and no external calls, the malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores should all remain at **0**.\n   - The high confidence score (1) is justified because the analysis aligns with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code snippet.",
