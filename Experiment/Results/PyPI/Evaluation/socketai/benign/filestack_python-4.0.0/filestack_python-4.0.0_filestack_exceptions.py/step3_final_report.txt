  "purpose": "Define a custom HTTP error exception class to include response body information for HTTP error handling.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code is a class definition with a docstring.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the class is purely declarative with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definition with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with a descriptive docstring referencing a GitHub pull request. It contains no methods, data handling, or external calls. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence, no obfuscation, no malware, and minimal security risk. The scores assigned are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present, and the code aligns with standard Python exception class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward custom exception class with no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
