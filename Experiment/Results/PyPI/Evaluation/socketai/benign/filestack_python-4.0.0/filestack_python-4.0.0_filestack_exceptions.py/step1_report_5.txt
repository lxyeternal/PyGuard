  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for HTTP errors, extending the built-in Exception class to include response body information.",
  "sources": "Class definition, including the class name, inheritance, and docstring.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, input reading, or data output in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways present in this small code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present; the code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception called FilestackHTTPError to handle HTTP errors with additional response information. It includes a descriptive docstring referencing a GitHub pull request. The implementation is minimal, with no functions or logic, and no external inputs or outputs. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The snippet is a typical custom exception class used for clearer error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
