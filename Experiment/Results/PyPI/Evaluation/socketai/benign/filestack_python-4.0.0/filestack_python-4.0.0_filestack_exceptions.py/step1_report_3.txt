  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for HTTP errors related to Filestack, extending the standard Exception class to include additional response body information.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "This snippet defines a custom exception class intended to replace or extend requests.exceptions.HTTPError for better error handling with response bodies. It contains only a class definition with a docstring. There is no data input, no handling of untrusted data, no external calls, and no malicious or suspicious logic. The code appears to be a standard, benign class definition meant for error management within a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign class definition used for handling HTTP errors with added context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
