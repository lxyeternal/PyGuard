  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code defines a class `FilestackHTTPError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - It contains a descriptive docstring referencing a GitHub pull request.\n   - There are no methods, data handling, or logic within the class.\n   - No external data, input/output, or runtime behavior is present.\n\n2. **Logical and Security Evaluation:**\n   - The class appears to be a straightforward custom exception designed to provide more context (like response body) when HTTP errors occur.\n   - No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or external calls.\n   - The code is consistent with typical Python exception class definitions.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports and the code indicate no malicious behavior. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear and straightforward; obfuscation score of 0 is correct.\n   - **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, a risk score of 0 or very close to it is justified. The reports uniformly assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Issues:**\n   - The reports are consistent and thorough; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent based on assumptions.\n   - The reference to a GitHub pull request in the docstring suggests the class might be part of a larger error handling strategy, but alone, it does not introduce security concerns.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a minimal, standard custom exception class with no security risks.\n   - The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if a minimal risk is considered, but 0 is more appropriate)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, straightforward, and free of security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns well with the code's characteristics.",
