  "purpose": "Importing mixin classes 'ImageTransformationMixin' and 'CommonMixin' from local modules, likely for extending functionality in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules within the package ('imagetransformation' and 'common').",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved, as this is only import statements without execution or data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs in these import statements; they simply load classes for later use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code consists solely of import statements without suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from local modules, which is typical for modular Python projects. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious data handling. No source-to-sink flows, no suspicious behaviors, and no evidence of malware. The minimal code structure suggests a standard pattern for code organization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement for local mixins, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of normal application structure.",
