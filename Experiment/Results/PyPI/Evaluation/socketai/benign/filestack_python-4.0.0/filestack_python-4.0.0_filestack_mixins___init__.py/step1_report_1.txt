{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules related to image transformation and common utilities, likely for processing or manipulating images within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the current package's modules: 'imagetransformation' and 'common'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are explicitly present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or external outputs are shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow is evident in this minimal import statement; no source-to-sink paths are demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, with straightforward import statements. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules within the package. There are no data processing, network connections, or code execution behaviors that could indicate malicious activity. The minimal structure suggests standard package imports, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code. Since the code does not contain any logic beyond importing, there are no security concerns evident from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is part of a larger module and does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious traits based on this snippet alone.",
