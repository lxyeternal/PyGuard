{
  "purpose": "The code imports two local modules, 'imagetransformation' and 'common', likely for use as mixins in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package, importing 'ImageTransformationMixin' and 'CommonMixin'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data handling present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports modules; no data flow from sources to sinks occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements importing local modules. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The import statements are standard for modular Python code. No external data, network activity, or code execution is involved. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature. Confidence is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements of local modules. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
