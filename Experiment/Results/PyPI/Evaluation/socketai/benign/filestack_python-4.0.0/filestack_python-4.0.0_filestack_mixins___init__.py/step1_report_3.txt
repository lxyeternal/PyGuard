{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import mixin classes related to image transformation and common functionalities, likely for use in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: '.imagetransformation' and '.common'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or exposed.",
  "flows": "Imports data from internal modules, with no evident data flow from external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code constructs, or suspicious patterns detected in the import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements using relative imports to include classes named ImageTransformationMixin and CommonMixin. These are presumably mixins that add specific functionalities to other classes. There are no function calls, data processing, or other logic present. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code are observed. Since these are simple import statements, they do not pose security risks on their own.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, only importing classes from internal modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues based on this snippet.",
