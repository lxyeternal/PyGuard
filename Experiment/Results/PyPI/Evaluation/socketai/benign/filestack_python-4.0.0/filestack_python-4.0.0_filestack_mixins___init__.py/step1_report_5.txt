  "sources": "Import statements for local modules: .imagetransformation and .common",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or untrusted sources; only module imports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for two local modules, likely part of a package. There are no functions, data processing, or other code constructs that could indicate malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution or data exfiltration points are present. The import statements are standard and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple module import without any malicious intent or security concerns. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
