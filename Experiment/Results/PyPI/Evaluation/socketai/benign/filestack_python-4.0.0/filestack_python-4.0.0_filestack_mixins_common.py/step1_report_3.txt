{
  "purpose": "Provides methods for manipulating, signing, storing, downloading, and analyzing file objects in the Filestack service.",
  "sources": "Reads security objects, file paths, and configuration parameters; calls to requests.get and requests.post for network operations.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external services via requests (requests.get and requests.post), file writing to local disk, and potential exposure of sensitive data via URL signing.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (security objects, paths, configurations) to network requests, file operations, and response handling. Signed URLs are generated and used in requests, with responses parsed for file handles and JSON data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code. Usage of requests library for network calls is standard. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures. Functions perform expected file and URL manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a clear API for file operations with network interactions, including signing URLs and performing analysis tasks like tags, sfw, and OCR. Network calls are made with the requests library to external Filestack endpoints, which is expected. No suspicious data leaks, backdoors, or malicious commands detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors found. File storage and download operations are straightforward. Potential security considerations include ensuring secure handling of security objects and validating response data, but no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate, providing a set of utility functions for interacting with the Filestack API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The network requests and file operations are standard for such SDKs. Overall, the code seems safe and well-structured.",
