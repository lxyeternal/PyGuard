  "purpose": "Validation schemas for storage configuration parameters using trafaret.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries for upload tags and storage parameters; keys in validate_upload_tags and STORE_SCHEMA.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted input data used in validation checks; no data sinks like network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into validation functions and schemas, which check data types and constraints; no dangerous data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs straightforward validation without suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines validation schemas for storage parameters, including enum, string, list, and mapping checks. It uses trafaret to enforce data types and constraints. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or file manipulations are present. The validation functions are standard and do not exhibit obfuscation or malicious behavior. The reports are empty, providing no evidence of issues. Given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious activity, the likelihood of malicious intent is negligible. The absence of detailed reports prevents further risk assessment, but based on the code alone, it is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward validation setup with no malicious or security-risk elements. The reports lack detail, so no issues can be confirmed. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk should be minimal or zero, reflecting the code's benign nature and the absence of evidence of malicious activity.",
