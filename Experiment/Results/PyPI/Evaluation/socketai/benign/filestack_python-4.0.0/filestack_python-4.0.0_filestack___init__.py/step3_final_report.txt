  "purpose": "Defines configuration constants, URLs, and headers for the SDK; sets up URL generation based on a configurable CNAME.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes, property methods, and module imports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Initialization of CFG instance, property access for URLs, import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static with no dynamic or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple configuration class with fixed URLs, headers, and properties that generate URLs based on a class attribute. There are no input handling, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no secrets or obfuscation. The module imports are standard and do not introduce malicious behavior. The code's static nature and clarity suggest no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a configuration setup for an SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is appropriate given its static, non-sensitive nature.",
