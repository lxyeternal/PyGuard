  "purpose": "Define configuration and import models/mixins for a Python client library interacting with a file storage API.",
  "sources": "Reading the API URL, headers, and CNAME configuration, as well as importing modules.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sinks such as network calls or file writes are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Configuration variables are set; imported modules are loaded; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior observed. The code appears to be straightforward configuration and module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class 'CFG' with static API URL and headers, initializes an instance 'config', and imports multiple modules. There are no functions executing untrusted code, network requests, or data processing that could lead to malicious activity. The code structure is typical for a client SDK setup, with no signs of obfuscated code or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration and import setup for a Python SDK. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this fragment.",
