  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is purely configuration; no input handling, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0, justified given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward SDK setup.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues here. The report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on static URLs and headers. No input validation or dynamic code.\n- **Malware score:** 0, correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1, slightly above zero but justified as a conservative measure since it's configuration code, not actively risky.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is consistent; no malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above—static configuration, no dynamic or untrusted data handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0, justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Well-reasoned.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Standard configuration and module imports, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to others—configuration constants, no data leaks, no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1, again a conservative default for configuration code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Consistent with previous assessments.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All correctly identified as 0.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, which is acceptable for configuration code; no active vulnerabilities or exploits are present.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- The code snippets are standard SDK configuration modules with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed in scoring.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a conservative default for static configuration code, but no real risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent. The reported scores and reasoning are appropriate.",
