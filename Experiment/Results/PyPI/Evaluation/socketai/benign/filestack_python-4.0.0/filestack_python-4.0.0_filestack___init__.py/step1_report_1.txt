  "purpose": "Define configuration constants and URL endpoints for the Filestack API client library.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all data is hardcoded or defined as class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted data or user input.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive functions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated elements. The URLs and headers appear standard for an SDK setup.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a configuration class with fixed API URLs, default chunk sizes, and headers that include version information. No input handling, user data processing, or dynamic code execution is present. The class provides properties to generate URLs based on a configurable CNAME, which defaults to a known CDN domain. The import statements are standard for a modular SDK. Overall, the code is straightforward and intended for configuration purposes only, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard SDK configuration setup with no malicious intent, no suspicious code patterns, and no evident security risks. It functions solely to store constants and generate URLs dynamically based on a configuration parameter.",
