{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration settings and class for interacting with the Filestack API, including URL endpoints and headers.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings for API URLs, version info, and class properties.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks of untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration values are hardcoded or set via class properties.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets (other than API URL and headers), or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes configuration parameters for a client library, with URL endpoints and headers that include version info. No input validation, dynamic code execution, or external data handling is present. The use of class properties and hardcoded URLs appears standard and benign. The imported modules suggest structured modular code, not malicious activity. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard configuration setup for a Python client library interfacing with the Filestack API. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. No security risks are identified based on this snippet.",
