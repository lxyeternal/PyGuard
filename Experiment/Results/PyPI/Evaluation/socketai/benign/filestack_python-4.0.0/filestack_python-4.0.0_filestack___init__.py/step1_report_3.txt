  "purpose": "Define configuration settings for the Filestack API client, including URLs, headers, and URL properties.",
  "sources": "Constants, class attributes, and property methods that generate URLs and headers; imports from other modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; the code primarily defines static configuration and URL generation.",
  "flows": "Configuration values flow into URL and header construction, but all are static or based on class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual code structures or suspicious dynamic behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a configuration class with static URLs, headers, and dynamic URL properties based on CNAME. It imports other modules but does not process untrusted input or execute any data flows that could lead to vulnerabilities. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup for a client SDK. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks and appears to be standard, well-structured code. No malware or security issues detected.",
