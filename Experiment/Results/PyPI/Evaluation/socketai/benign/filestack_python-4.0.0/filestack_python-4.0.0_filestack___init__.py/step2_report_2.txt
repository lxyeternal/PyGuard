  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** The code is a configuration class with fixed URLs, headers, and properties. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, no external data sources. The analysis states that the code is straightforward SDK setup.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely static configuration with no signs of malicious behavior. The confidence score is 1, malware is 0, and security risk is 0.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. No issues found. The score seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on static URLs, headers, and no input validation or dynamic behaviors. No suspicious code patterns.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code remains a static configuration, and the analysis confirms no malicious activity. Security risk is minimal (0.1), which seems acceptable given the context.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is consistent. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Again, static configuration with URL generation based on a class attribute. No input handling or external commands. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard SDK setup, with no malicious indicators.\n\n- **Verdict:** The analysis and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous reports—configuration class, module imports, no untrusted data handling.\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior or security risks.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is solid; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Defines configuration constants and imports modules. No network operations, no data processing, no secrets.\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears benign, with a slight security risk score (0.1) possibly reflecting the general nature of SDK configuration, but no real risk.\n\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is consistent; the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** None of the reports identify actual vulnerabilities or malicious code. All reports correctly conclude that the code is benign, static configuration.\n\n- **Logic and Reasoning:** The reasoning is consistent, well-justified, and based on the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which is correct. The obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate. The security risk scores are low, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nGiven all the reports and the code snippet, I agree with the provided scores and conclusions. The code is a standard SDK configuration module with no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, as it’s just configuration code)\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and reasoning.",
