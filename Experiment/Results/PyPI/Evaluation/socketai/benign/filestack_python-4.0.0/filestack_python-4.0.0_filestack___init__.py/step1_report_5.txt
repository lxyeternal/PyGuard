  "purpose": "Define configuration settings and imports for a file upload and processing library, including API URLs, headers, and class initializations.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for API URLs, headers, and class attribute values.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or user input; no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily sets configuration parameters and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or secret keys; no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes configuration parameters such as API URLs, headers, and class initializations. It uses static values and imports multiple modules. There are no functions performing untrusted input handling, network operations, or data processing that could lead to security issues. No hardcoded secrets or sensitive information are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration and module import section with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign configuration setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines constants and imports modules without executing harmful actions.",
