{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to verify webhook signatures from Filestack by checking the HMAC signature based on a secret, request body, and headers.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the 'body' parameter (raw webhook content), 'headers' dictionary, and 'secret' string.",
  "sinks": "HMAC computation using the secret, body, and headers; compares computed signature with the header value.",
  "flows": "The code flows from input validation, normalization of headers, computation of HMAC, and comparison with provided signature.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant re-creation of 'lowercase_headers' dictionary; absence of input sanitization beyond type checks; no evident malicious code. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard HMAC verification for webhook authenticity. It validates input types, normalizes headers, computes an HMAC signature, and compares it to the provided signature. The only minor anomaly is the repeated creation of 'lowercase_headers'. No malicious behavior or malicious code patterns are evident. It does not execute untrusted data nor contains obfuscated or suspicious constructs. The logic is straightforward and intended for security validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of webhook signature verification with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs input validation, normalization, and cryptographic comparison securely. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
