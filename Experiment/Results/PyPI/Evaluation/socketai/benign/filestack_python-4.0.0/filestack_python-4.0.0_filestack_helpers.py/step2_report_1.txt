  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code, and assessing the scores and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward implementation of webhook signature verification using HMAC SHA256.\n- It performs input validation, normalizes headers, decodes body if bytes, constructs the HMAC data string, and compares signatures.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code structures are present.\n- No network or file operations, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- Redundant redefinition of 'lowercase_headers' occurs but is harmless.\n- The logic aligns with standard secure practices.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 1: Malware Score (all reports)**\n\n**Scores assigned:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code does not perform any malicious actions. It only verifies signatures. No malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The malware score should remain **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 2: Obfuscated Score (all reports)**\n\n**Scores assigned:** 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated. The redundant redefinition of 'lowercase_headers' is a minor inefficiency but not obfuscation. The obfuscated score should remain **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 3: Security Risk / Overall Risk Scores**\n\n**Scores assigned:**  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 to 0.2  \n- Overall risk: 0.1 to 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is a standard, well-understood implementation of webhook verification. The risk is minimal, mainly related to correct secret management and ensuring HTTPS in production. There are no evident vulnerabilities or supply chain issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe risk scores are reasonable and should stay low, around **0.1-0.2**.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 4: Logical or Implementation Flaws**\n\n**Potential concern:**  \n- The redundant creation of 'lowercase_headers' twice in the function `verify_webhook_signature`.  \n- No input sanitization beyond type validation, but for signature verification, this is acceptable.\n\n**Impact:**  \nMinor, not affecting security or functionality.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment and recommended scores:**\n\n| Aspect                  | Current Score | Justification                                              | Recommended Score |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Malware                 | 0               | No malicious activity present                                | 0                   |\n| Obfuscated              | 0               | Clear, straightforward code                                   | 0                   |\n| Security / Overall Risk | 0.1 - 0.2       | Standard, secure implementation with minimal risk            | 0.1 - 0.2         |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a typical, secure webhook signature verification implementation.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- The redundant header normalization is a minor inefficiency but not harmful.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nKeep malware and obfuscated scores at **0**. Maintain the low security risk score around **0.1** to **0.2**. The reports' assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No supply chain or malicious activity concerns are justified based on the provided code.",
