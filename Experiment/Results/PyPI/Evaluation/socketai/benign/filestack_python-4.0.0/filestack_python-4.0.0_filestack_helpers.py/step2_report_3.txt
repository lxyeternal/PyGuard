  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code performs standard webhook signature verification.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are identified.\n- The code is straightforward, with minor redundancies (e.g., redefinition of 'lowercase_headers') which do not impact security.\n- The 'malware' score is consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the conclusion that no malicious activity is present.\n- The 'securityRisk' scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern, which seems appropriate given the context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n- The code does not contain hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- It correctly validates input types.\n- It performs HMAC SHA-256 signature verification as expected.\n- The redundant redefinition of 'lowercase_headers' is harmless but could be cleaned up for clarity.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious payloads.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The only minor flaw is the redundant line:\n  ```python\n  lowercase_headers = dict((k.lower(), v) for k, v in headers.items())\n  ```\n  appearing twice in `verify_webhook_signature`. This is harmless but could be cleaned up.\n\n- The code does not sanitize or verify the content of headers beyond type checking, but for this use case, that is standard.\n\n### Score Reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is clear.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.1-0.2 is reasonable, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n### Specific Points:\n- The code's logic is sound and aligns with best practices.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the verification process is standard.\n- The repeated creation of 'lowercase_headers' is an inefficiency but not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, mostly due to minor redundancy)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, secure implementation of webhook signature verification. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The minor redundancy does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Remove the duplicate line creating 'lowercase_headers' for clarity.\n- Consider adding explicit validation for header values if needed, but current checks are sufficient.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent; the code is safe and well-implemented for its purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n- The overall security posture is solid, with no malware or obfuscation concerns.\n\n**End of review.**",
