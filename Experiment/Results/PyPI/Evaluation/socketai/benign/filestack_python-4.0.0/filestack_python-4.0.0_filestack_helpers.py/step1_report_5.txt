{
  "purpose": "The code verifies webhook signatures to ensure authenticity, specifically for Filestack webhooks, by checking HMAC signatures based on provided headers and body.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'secret', 'body', and 'headers' parameters, and from headers in the 'headers' argument.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'hmac.new' to generate a signature, which could be exploited if 'secret' or 'body' are maliciously manipulated, but in this context, it is used for verification only.",
  "flows": "Input 'secret', 'body', and 'headers' are validated; 'headers' are normalized; 'body' decoded if bytes; HMAC signature generated from headers and body; compared against provided signature.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or unusual language features. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected; repetitive normalization of headers is redundant but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard webhook verification using HMAC. It validates input parameters, normalizes headers, decodes body if bytes, constructs a data string for HMAC, and compares the computed signature with the provided one. No suspicious data leakage, no backdoors, and no malicious actions are present. The logic aligns with standard security practices for webhook verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate webhook signature verification implementation with no evident malicious intent. It correctly validates inputs and performs HMAC verification, which is typical for webhook security. No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are apparent.",
