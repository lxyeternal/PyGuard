  "purpose": "Webhook signature verification using HMAC SHA256 to ensure authenticity of received webhooks.",
  "sources": "Headers 'fs-signature' and 'fs-timestamp', and the request body.",
  "sinks": "Signature comparison; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Headers 'fs-timestamp' and 'fs-signature' serve as sources; signature is computed and compared at the sink.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant redefinition of 'lowercase_headers' within the verification function; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation of inputs, normalizes headers, decodes body if bytes, constructs an HMAC data string, and compares the computed signature with the provided one. No hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or obfuscation are present. The redundant header normalization is a minor inefficiency but not harmful. The signature verification logic aligns with best practices, and no suspicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, secure implementation of webhook signature verification with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor redundancy does not impact security. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and the security risk score is appropriately low (~0.1).",
