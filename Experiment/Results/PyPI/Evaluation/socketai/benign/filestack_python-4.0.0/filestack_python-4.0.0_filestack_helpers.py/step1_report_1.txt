{
  "purpose": "The code verifies webhook signatures from Filestack to ensure authenticity of received webhook requests.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters ('secret', 'body', 'headers') and headers dictionary; accesses header values.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'hmac.new' to generate a signature based on secret, headers, and body; compares generated signature with provided signature.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> check_validation -> process headers -> create HMAC signature -> compare signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures; redundant redefinition of 'lowercase_headers'.",
  "analysis": "The code properly validates input types and contents, ensuring that 'headers' is a dictionary with required keys, and 'body' is string or bytes. Signature computation uses HMAC with SHA256, which is standard for webhook verification. The redefinition of 'lowercase_headers' is redundant but harmless. No suspicious data exfiltration or malicious behavior is evident. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present. The code performs typical signature verification securely, assuming correct secrets and headers are provided.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard webhook signature verification function with no signs of malicious intent. It properly validates inputs and uses secure cryptographic practices. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
