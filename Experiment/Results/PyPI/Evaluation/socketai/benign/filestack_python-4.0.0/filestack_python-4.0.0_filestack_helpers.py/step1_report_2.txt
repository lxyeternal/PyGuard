{
  "purpose": "The code verifies webhook signatures from Filestack to ensure authenticity and integrity of received webhook data.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters 'secret', 'body', and 'headers'; also reads 'headers' keys 'FS-Timestamp' and 'FS-Signature'.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'hmac.new' with the secret and data to generate a signature, compares with header 'FS-Signature'. No data leakage or external system interaction occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through validation checks, constructs HMAC data string, computes signature, and compares it to the expected signature from headers.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward with no suspicious or unusual code structures, no hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. No use of dynamic code execution or external malicious calls.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard webhook verification by computing an HMAC SHA-256 signature from the timestamp and body, then compares it to the provided signature. Validation functions check data types for 'body' and 'headers'. The process is standard for webhook security. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The logic is clear, with appropriate validation, and no suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical webhook signature verification implementation. It contains no malicious behavior or malicious intent. It performs standard security validation for webhook authenticity. No security risks or malware indications are present.",
