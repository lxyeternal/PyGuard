  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard webhook signature verification.\n- Code validation: Proper input validation, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Behavior: Uses HMAC SHA-256 with timestamp and body, compares signatures.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2 (low)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code performs standard, secure signature verification with no malicious intent. The redundancy in 'lowercase_headers' is noted but harmless. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar webhook verification.\n- Behavior: Straightforward HMAC computation and comparison.\n- Anomalies: No suspicious code, no hardcoded secrets.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1 (very low)\n- Confidence: 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The code is standard, with no signs of malicious activity. Malware score remains appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same verification approach.\n- Behavior: Standard HMAC SHA-256, proper validation.\n- Anomalies: No secrets hardcoded, no obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Valid and secure implementation, no malicious indicators. Malware score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Behavior: Validates signature, normalizes headers.\n- Anomalies: Redundant re-creation of 'lowercase_headers'.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Slight redundancy but not malicious. The overall logic remains standard and secure.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Similar webhook signature verification.\n- Behavior: Validates, normalizes headers, decodes body, computes HMAC.\n- Anomalies: No secrets hardcoded, no obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0\n- Security risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** The code is consistent with best practices, no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, standard implementation of webhook signature verification.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The redundant redefinition of 'lowercase_headers' is minor and not malicious.\n- The malware scores across reports are all zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code performs cryptographically secure verification using HMAC SHA-256.\n- It validates input types and headers appropriately.\n- No malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident.\n- The redundancy does not introduce security issues.\n\n### Overall Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** Given the context of supply chain security, the code is standard and secure, so a low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, secure webhook signature verification implementation with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain risk. The existing scores accurately reflect its security posture.",
