  "purpose": "Parse XML elements to extract diagnostic communication references and parameter references, resolving them to internal objects within a diagnostic system.",
  "sources": "XML elements 'DIAG-COMM-SNREF', 'OUT-PARAM-IF-SNREF', 'IN-PARAM-IF-SNREF' attributes and sub-elements.",
  "sinks": "Resolution functions like 'resolve_snref' which map references to internal objects; no direct data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "XML parsing → reference extraction → 'resolve_snref' calls → assignment to class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'odxraise()' without specific messages; reliance on external functions whose implementations are unknown; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data class for handling diagnostic component references. It parses XML, validates tags, extracts reference names, and resolves them via external functions. No malicious code, obfuscation, or network activity is present. Error handling via 'odxraise()' lacks messages, which could hinder debugging but does not introduce security risks. External functions like 'resolve_snref' are critical; if compromised, they could pose risks, but within this code, their usage appears standard and safe. The overall security risk score is low, given the absence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The malware score is zero, and the code is clear and well-structured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard XML parsing and reference resolution component within a diagnostic framework. No malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation is evident. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and conservative, considering reliance on external functions. Vigilance should be maintained regarding the security of external dependencies, but the code itself is safe.",
