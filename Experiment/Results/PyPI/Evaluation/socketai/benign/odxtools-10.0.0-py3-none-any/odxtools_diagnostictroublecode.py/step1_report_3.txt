  "purpose": "Defines a data class for Diagnostic Trouble Codes with methods for parsing from XML elements and resolving references.",
  "sources": "Reads XML elements ('TROUBLE-CODE', 'DISPLAY-TROUBLE-CODE', 'TEXT', 'LEVEL', 'SDGS/SDG', 'IS-TEMPORARY') and attributes.",
  "sinks": "Uses the parsed data for object construction and link resolution; no direct data sinks like network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "XML input -> parsing methods -> object attributes -> link resolution methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. Use of standard library functions and straightforward data parsing without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical data structure implementation with parsing logic for XML data. It uses standard patterns such as dataclasses, type hints, and property methods. The methods primarily convert XML elements into Python objects and resolve internal links. No external network calls, system modifications, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code does include some attribute resolution and link-building functions, but these are standard for such data models. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious privacy violations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate part of an XML parsing library for diagnostic trouble codes. It contains no malicious behavior or suspicious patterns. The code is well-structured, uses standard practices, and performs typical data parsing and reference resolution tasks.",
