  "purpose": "Defines a data class for handling company-specific information extracted from XML, including related documents and special data groups, with methods for linking and resolving references.",
  "sources": "Input XML element 'et_element' from which related docs and SDGs are extracted; internal methods called on related docs and SDGs.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data for external effects; internal data handling appears straightforward.",
  "flows": "Extracts data from XML -> Creates related doc and SDG objects -> Builds and resolves links and references internally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or unusual constructs observed. Use of standard libraries and straightforward data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly processes XML data structures, constructs objects, and manages internal link resolution. No network access, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious API usage or external calls are evident. The methods perform data aggregation, linkage, and reference resolution which are typical and safe operations. No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard data handling module for XML-based data structures. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious network activity, or security risks based on the provided snippet. The overall security risk is low.",
