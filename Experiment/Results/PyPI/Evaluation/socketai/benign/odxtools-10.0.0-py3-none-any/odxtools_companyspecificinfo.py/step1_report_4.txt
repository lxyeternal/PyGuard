  "purpose": "Define a data structure for company-specific information, parsing XML elements and managing ODX links and references.",
  "sources": "XML element input (et_element) in from_et method, which reads 'RELATED-DOCS' and 'SDGS' sub-elements.",
  "sinks": "Methods that update or resolve ODX links and references (_build_odxlinks, _resolve_odxlinks, _resolve_snrefs). These handle internal data structures, not untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "XML data flows from from_et method into RelatedDoc and SpecialDataGroup instances, which in turn build or resolve links and references within the object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or malicious patterns detected. The code primarily handles data parsing and link resolution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class for handling company-specific info, with methods for parsing XML elements, building ODX link dictionaries, and resolving links and references. It uses standard Python features, such as list comprehensions, method calls, and data structures, without any dynamic code execution or network activity. No signs of malicious behavior or malicious code injection are present. All functions operate within expected data handling boundaries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured implementation for parsing and managing related documents and data groups. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks in the analyzed code.",
