  "purpose": "Defines a data type for handling leading length information in protocol encoding/decoding.",
  "sources": "Parsing XML element for 'BIT-LENGTH'; potentially reading data during encode/decode methods.",
  "sinks": "Encoding and decoding methods where data is written to or read from data streams or buffers.",
  "flows": "XML parsing to initialize type -> encoding length fields -> actual data encoding -> data decoding.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of assertions and error raises are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a data class for leading length information with methods to encode/decode this length info. It reads configuration from XML and performs data handling with validation. The encode/decode methods interact with data buffers but do not perform network, file, or system modifications. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated patterns, or external suspicious calls are observed. The logic appears consistent with protocol encoding tasks, with no indicators of malicious intent or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for handling leading length information in protocol encoding/decoding, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
