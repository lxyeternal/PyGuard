  "purpose": "Define constants for numeral systems (hex, dec, bin, oct) using an enumeration.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static enum members define numeral bases.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; straightforward enum.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static enumeration class with four members representing numeral system bases. It contains no input/output, data processing, external dependencies, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with full confidence. The code's purpose is clear, and no security concerns or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static enumeration defining numeral system constants. All analyses and scores are appropriate and consistent with its simple, safe nature. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
