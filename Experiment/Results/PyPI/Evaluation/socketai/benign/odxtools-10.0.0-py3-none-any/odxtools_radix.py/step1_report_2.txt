{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for different number systems (hexadecimal, decimal, binary, octal).",
  "sources": "No input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink since no input or data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the IntEnum class from the enum module and defines a class Radix inheriting from IntEnum, assigning integer values to various radix bases. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic code features. The code appears straightforward and standard for defining constants.\n\nNo sources of untrusted data, no sinks that could leak data, and no flow of data from untrusted inputs are present. The code is minimal, focused solely on constant definitions, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign enumeration of number systems with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
