  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for different numeral systems (hexadecimal, decimal, binary, octal).",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present; no data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code solely defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the IntEnum class and defines an enumeration Radix with four members representing numeral bases. The code is straightforward, only establishing constants without any input handling, output, or complex logic. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign enumeration defining numeral systems. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
