{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for different numeral systems (hexadecimal, decimal, binary, octal).",
  "sources": "No input reading; class definition uses static constants.",
  "sinks": "No data output or processing involving untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static enum definitions with no runtime data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; simple static class with enum values. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports IntEnum to create a class Radix that assigns integer values to common numeral systems. It is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no input handling, output, or complex logic. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. It appears to serve as a utility for other code that may need to specify or handle different radixes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility class defining numeral system constants with no malicious intent or security risks.",
