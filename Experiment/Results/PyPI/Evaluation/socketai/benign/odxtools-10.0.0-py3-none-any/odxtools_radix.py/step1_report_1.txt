  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for number bases (radix) such as hexadecimal, decimal, binary, and octal.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, defining a simple enumeration without any unusual patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the IntEnum class and defines a class Radix that assigns integer values to different number base identifiers. It is a simple, standard enumeration without dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious logic. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic enumeration definition with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears to serve a purpose of representing different numeral systems and contains no suspicious or malicious elements.",
