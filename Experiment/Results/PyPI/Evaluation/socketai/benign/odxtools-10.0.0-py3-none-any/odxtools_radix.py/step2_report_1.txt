  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward enumeration defining constants for numeral systems.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data input/output, or external dependencies.\n   - The code is static and minimal, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical errors or overlooked issues are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores seem reasonable given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all analyses agree on the benign nature, and there's no evidence of malicious activity, the risk scores are appropriately low (0).\n   - No justification exists for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's static nature.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - The confidence level of 1 reflects certainty about the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a simple, static enumeration with no input/output, no dynamic features, and no suspicious patterns. All evidence points to it being a benign utility class.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Score | Justification                                               |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0            | No malicious activity or code behavior present.             |\n| Obfuscated        | 0            | Clear, straightforward enum definition with no obfuscation.|\n| Security Risk     | 0            | No vulnerabilities, data flows, or external interactions. |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, benign, and serves a simple purpose. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
