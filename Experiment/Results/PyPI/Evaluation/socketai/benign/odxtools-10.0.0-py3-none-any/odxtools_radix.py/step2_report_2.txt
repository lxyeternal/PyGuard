  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code.\n\n**Summary of the original code:**\n- Defines an enumeration `Radix` inheriting from `IntEnum`.\n- Contains four members: HEX=16, DEC=10, BIN=2, OCT=8.\n- No input/output, data processing, or external interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the issues' presence:\n- The reports all agree that the code is a straightforward enumeration with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- No input sources, data sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation detected.\n- The code is simple and static.\n\n**Conclusion:** The issues as described are *not* present in the code. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of the reasoning and scores:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code does not contain any malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward static enum.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Scores seem reasonable and consistent.** No adjustments needed here.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The reports are thorough and correctly identify that the code is benign.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made; all conclusions are based on static analysis.\n- The code's purpose is clear: defining constants for numeral systems.\n\n---\n\n### Final personal estimate:\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the reports' assessments.\n\n**Proposed scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a simple, static enumeration with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports?** No.\n- **Scores reasonable?** Yes.\n- **Risk scores justified?** Yes, all are 0.\n- **Malware scores?** Correct at 0.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities?** None; the analysis is sound.\n- **Scores consistent?** Yes.\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The code is benign, and the reports accurately reflect this. No security concerns or malicious elements are present.",
