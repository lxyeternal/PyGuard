  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for validation status types",
  "sources": "The code reads the Enum class definition and the string values assigned to enum members",
  "sinks": "No data sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output functions are used",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines an enumeration",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward Enum class with string values",
  "analysis": "The code imports Enum from the enum module, defines a class ValidType with four string members representing validation statuses. The code is simple, static, and does not perform any input/output, network activity, or data processing. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious behavior, and no dynamic or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enumeration definition with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks.",
