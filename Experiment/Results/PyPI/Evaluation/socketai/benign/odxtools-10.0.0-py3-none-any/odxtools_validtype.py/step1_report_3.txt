  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration 'ValidType' with specific string constants to represent validation statuses.",
  "sources": "No input reading; static enum definition.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward enum declaration with standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class from the enum module and defines a simple enumeration with four members. It does not include any user input, network operations, file handling, or other potentially malicious behaviors. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs. The code appears to serve as a part of a validation status system and contains no indicators of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard enumeration definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
