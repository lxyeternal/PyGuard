  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the original code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It imports the Enum class.\n- Defines a class `ValidType` with four string members: \"VALID\", \"NOT-VALID\", \"NOT-DEFINED\", \"NOT-AVAILABLE\".\n- The code is static, with no input/output, data processing, or external interactions.\n- The code appears to be a simple enumeration for validation statuses.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- **Issues in the code:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward enum definition with no malicious or suspicious features.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risks:** None.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent; no logical errors are identified in the code.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified as the code is a benign enum definition.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is a static enum declaration with no runtime logic, input/output, or external interactions, a risk score higher than 0.1 would be unreasonable.\n- The reports' scores are consistent and justified.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made in the reports, which is correct.\n- The code does not contain any secrets, network calls, or dynamic behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign and straightforward.**\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n- The code is a standard enum definition with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk features.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that in larger contexts, such static definitions are used appropriately and that no dynamic or external data is introduced elsewhere that could pose risks.",
