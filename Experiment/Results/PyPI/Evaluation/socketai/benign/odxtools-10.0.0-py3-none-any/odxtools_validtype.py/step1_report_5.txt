  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for validation status labels.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read by the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, data leaks, or sensitive information processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class, defines an Enum 'ValidType' with four string values representing validation states. There are no data inputs, outputs, or side effects. No signs of malicious activity or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward enum definition for use elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple, and non-malicious. It serves as a data structure definition without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
