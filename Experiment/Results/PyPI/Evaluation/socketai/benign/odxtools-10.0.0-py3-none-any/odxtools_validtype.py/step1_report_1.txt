  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class ValidType with specific string values representing validation states.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs, no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code solely defines an enum class without any runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, defining an enum without obfuscated or suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class from the enum module and defines a simple enumeration ValidType with four members. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no external interactions. The enum members are standard string assignments representing validation statuses. The code appears to be a typical definition for a set of constants used elsewhere in a larger application. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard enum definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no anomalies or malicious behavior, and there is no indication of obfuscation or malware. The code is safe and straightforward.",
