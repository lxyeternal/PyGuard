  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration ValidType with validation status strings.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources; static enum members.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static declaration with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward enum definition, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Enum and defines a class ValidType with four string members representing validation statuses. It contains no input/output, external data, dynamic code, or obfuscated constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the static, simple nature of the code. No logical flaws or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static enum definition with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
