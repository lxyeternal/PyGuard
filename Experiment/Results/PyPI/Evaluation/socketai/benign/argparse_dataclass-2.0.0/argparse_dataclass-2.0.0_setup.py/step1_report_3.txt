{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python module named 'argparse_dataclass'. It automates reading version info and README content, and configures package metadata for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading version information from 'argparse_dataclass.py', reading README.rst for long description, and static package metadata declarations.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains untrusted data sinks; it only reads local files and passes data to the setup() function.",
  "flows": "File contents are read (sources), processed with regex or assigned as arguments, and passed to setup(), with no untrusted data flow to external systems or networks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, hardcoded secrets beyond package metadata, or unusual code patterns. The regex is straightforward, and file I/O is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script reads local files to extract version info and README content, then uses setuptools.setup() to configure package installation. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data leaks, or network activities. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. All code aligns with typical Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected packaging functions without any suspicious behavior.",
