  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: a standard setup script that reads version info from a Python file and a README for description, then calls `setuptools.setup()`.\n- No untrusted input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- The regex used is simple and safe.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** No issues found; code is standard and secure.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no concerns.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; standard setup script, benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same findings; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Standard packaging code, no issues.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Same as others; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None detected.\n- **Score consistency:** All scores are reasonable; malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Potential for higher risk scores:** None justified, as the code performs standard packaging tasks without any malicious or suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score justification:** The code does not perform any malicious actions, so malware=0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, so obfuscated=0 is correct.\n- **Security risk:** No vulnerabilities or risks are evident; securityRisk=0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:** The code is a typical, well-structured setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All scores are aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The code is benign, and no changes are necessary.",
