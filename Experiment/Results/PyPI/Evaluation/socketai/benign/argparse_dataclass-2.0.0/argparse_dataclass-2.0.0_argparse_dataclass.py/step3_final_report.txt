  "purpose": "Generate command-line interface options from dataclasses, parsing args into dataclass instances based on field metadata.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments provided to argparse, field metadata in dataclasses (args, type, choices, help, nargs, required, default, default_factory).",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of dataclasses with parsed arguments; no external data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "CLI args -> argparse -> metadata extraction -> argument parsing -> dataclass instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. The custom BooleanOptionalAction is a standard backport pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard, transparent CLI generator from dataclasses, handling types, defaults, choices, and boolean flags. It uses well-known patterns for compatibility and argument handling. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility for creating CLIs from dataclasses. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate given its purpose and implementation.",
