  "purpose": "This code exports specific functions and classes from a local module for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module '.api' to import 'get_metrics_datas' and 'MetricsChart'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external data processing or output is shown.",
  "flows": "The code imports functions/classes from a module and exposes them via __all__, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two objects from a local module '.api' and defines __all__ to specify exports. No input handling, data processing, or suspicious patterns are present. It appears to be a simple module setup, with no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, primarily establishing module exports. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
