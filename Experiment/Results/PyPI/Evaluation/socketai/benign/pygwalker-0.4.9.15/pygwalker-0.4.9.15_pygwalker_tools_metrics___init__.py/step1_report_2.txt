{
  "purpose": "This module re-exports specific functions and classes from the 'api' submodule, likely for use in other parts of the project.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'get_metrics_datas' and 'MetricsChart' from a local 'api' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output observed.",
  "flows": "The code only performs an import and defines __all__, so no data flow or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two components from a local module and sets the __all__ list for exports. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no external communications or security-sensitive operations. The code structure is straightforward and standard for a Python package.\n\nSince it does not perform any runtime operations beyond imports and export definitions, it presents no immediate security concerns or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module re-export with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of normal package structure, with no anomalies or suspicious activities.",
