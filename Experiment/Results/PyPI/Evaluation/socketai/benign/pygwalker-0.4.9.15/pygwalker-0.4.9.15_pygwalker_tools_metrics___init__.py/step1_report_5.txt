{
  "purpose": "This code is defining the public API for a module by importing specific functions and classes from a relative module and setting the __all__ variable for export.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module (.api) importing get_metrics_datas and MetricsChart",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data, external inputs, or potentially dangerous functions",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from external sources to sinks, no user input handling or external communication",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; straightforward import and export statements",
  "analysis": "The code imports two elements from a local module (.api): a function and a class. It then explicitly exports these two elements via the __all__ list. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or other malicious indicators. The code appears to serve as a module interface definition, with no active logic or data processing.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module interface declaration with no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks identified. It appears safe and standard for a Python package.",
