{
  "purpose": "This code module imports specific functions and classes from a local submodule (.api) and exposes them via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module .api during import time.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data at runtime.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to static import from .api and defining __all__, with no runtime data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal re-export module with no runtime logic, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports are accurate; the scores should be maintained at zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
