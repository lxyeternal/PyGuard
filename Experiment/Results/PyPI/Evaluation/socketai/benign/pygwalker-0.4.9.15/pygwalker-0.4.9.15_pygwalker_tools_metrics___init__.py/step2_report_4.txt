  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module that imports specific functions/classes from a local module (.api) and re-exports them via __all__.\n- No external data, user input, or network activity is involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk is minimal or zero, with some reports assigning 0.1 perhaps as a conservative default.\n\n**Confirming code issues:**\n- The code is minimal and simple; it does not perform any runtime operations beyond imports and setting __all__.\n- There are no errors, flaws, or mistakes evident in the code snippet.\n- The code is typical for defining module exports in Python and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.\n\n**Analysis of the reasoning:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no security concerns.\n- They do not assume any vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond the code's surface-level functionality.\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with a few at 0.1; given the code's simplicity, this is acceptable.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- No issues or flaws are present in the code or the reports.\n- The scores seem appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n**My overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard module export pattern with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n- The risk score can be confidently set at 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
