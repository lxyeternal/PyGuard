  "purpose": "This module re-exports specific functions and classes from the api module for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports get_metrics_datas and MetricsChart from the same package (relative import).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data processing are present; the code merely imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code constructs, or unusual behavior. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import from a relative module and defines __all__ for exports. It lacks any input handling, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module that re-exports symbols without any malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard part of a larger package, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
