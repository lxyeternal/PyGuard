{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports two components, 'get_metrics_datas' and 'MetricsChart', from the local 'api' module for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports from a local module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code merely re-exports components.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code patterns, or hardcoded secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports two objects from a local 'api' module and then explicitly exports them via __all__. It contains no data processing, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behavior. The simplicity and lack of external data handling suggest low security concern.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module export statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not interact with untrusted data or perform any operations that pose security risks.",
