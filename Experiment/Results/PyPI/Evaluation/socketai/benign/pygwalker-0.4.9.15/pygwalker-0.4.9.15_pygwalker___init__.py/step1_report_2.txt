{
  "purpose": "Initializes logging, imports modules, sets version and hash, and conditionally displays messages based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, reads environment variables (__hash__, __version__, GlobalVarManager.privacy), calls check_kaggle() to determine environment.",
  "sinks": "Potentially displays logs and info messages; calls check_kaggle() and show_tips_user_kaggle() functions which might perform environment-specific actions.",
  "flows": "Imports and initializes logging -> Checks privacy mode -> Logs info if offline -> Checks Kaggle environment -> Calls show_tips_user_kaggle() if on Kaggle.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamically generated __hash__ with rand_str() could be for tracking or obfuscation but isn't malicious by itself. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns detected. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. Import order and conditional logic are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes modules and performs environment checks. The only dynamic element is __hash__ generated via rand_str(), which could be used for tracking or session purposes, not inherently malicious. Environment-based logs and tips are standard practices. No external network connections, data leaks, or malicious behavior evident. No suspicious code flow, data exfiltration, or backdoors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard setup and environment checking code with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. The overall security risk is low.",
