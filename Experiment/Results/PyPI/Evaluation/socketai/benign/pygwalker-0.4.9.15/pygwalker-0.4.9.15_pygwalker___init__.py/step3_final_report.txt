  "purpose": "Initialization and environment detection for the pygwalker package, including logging setup, versioning, and user notifications.",
  "sources": "Import statements, environment variable checks (__check_kaggle()), random string generation (__rand_str()), and environment configuration (__check_kaggle(), GlobalVarManager.privacy).",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, user messaging (info logs and show_tips_user_kaggle), and internal state updates.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> generate __hash__ -> check environment variables -> log offline mode -> check Kaggle environment -> show user tips if on Kaggle -> expose functions via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __rand_str() to generate __hash__, which is unusual but not malicious; environment-dependent messaging is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package initialization: setting up logging, importing utilities, defining version and a random hash, and performing environment checks for offline mode and Kaggle. No network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution is present. The use of a randomly generated __hash__ is typical for internal identification. Environment checks and user messaging are benign. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign and straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign initialization script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The use of dynamic hash generation and environment checks are normal practices. The scores and assessments in the reports are justified and accurate.",
