  "purpose": "This code provides functions and classes for generating various analytical metrics and visualizations from datasets, particularly focused on user engagement metrics like retention, page views, and active users.",
  "sources": "Data is sourced from the 'dataset' parameter (which can be a DataFrame or Connector object). SQL queries are generated based on metric names and field mappings, and data retrieval depends on parser methods like '_get_datas_by_sql' or 'get_datas_by_sql'.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into DataFrame objects after being retrieved and JSON serialization/deserialization. Visualizations are generated using 'to_chart_html'. No direct sinks involve untrusted data manipulation or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data is retrieved via SQL queries generated from metric names and field maps; then data is serialized/deserialized via JSON to create DataFrames; finally, visualizations are created using 'Chart' objects with the data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Usage of standard libraries and clear data flow. No signs of backdoors or malicious system commands. No untrusted input handling that could lead to injection. The code appears to be for data analysis and visualization only.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries, defines classes for visualization ('Chart') and data retrieval ('get_metrics_datas', 'MetricsChart'). It constructs SQL queries dynamically based on metrics and field mappings. The data is retrieved via parser methods, converted into JSON, and then into DataFrames for visualization. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication to unknown domains, code injection, or backdoor mechanisms. The logic is consistent with a data analytics tool. No obfuscation or malware signatures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a data analytics and visualization module for user engagement metrics. It performs data retrieval via SQL and creates visualizations without any suspicious or malicious behaviors. There are no signs of malware, malicious backdoors, or security risks present in this code.",
