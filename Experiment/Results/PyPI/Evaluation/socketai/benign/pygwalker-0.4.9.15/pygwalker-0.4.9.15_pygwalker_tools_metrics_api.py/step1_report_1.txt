{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and classes to generate various analytics metrics and visualizations from datasets, including data retrieval via SQL and rendering charts.",
  "sources": "Data is read from dataset objects (either DataFrame or Connector), and SQL queries are generated and executed via parser methods. Data is also loaded and encoded using json and pandas.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into chart rendering functions, JSON encoding, and pandas DataFrame creation. No direct data leaks or system access points are evident.",
  "flows": "Dataset input -> parser method to generate SQL -> SQL execution to retrieve data -> data transformation (json.loads, pandas DataFrame) -> Chart creation with encoded data",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic code execution. The code relies on standard libraries and a consistent data processing pipeline.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for chart visualization and metrics retrieval, with clear data handling from datasets to visual output. The SQL query generation depends on external functions, but there is no evidence of malicious SQL injection or unsafe practices. Data serialization and encoding appear standard. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are present. The structure and library use are typical for data analysis and visualization tools.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate data analytics and visualization module with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly orchestrates data retrieval and chart rendering through standard, well-understood patterns.",
