{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for data visualization and metrics extraction from datasets, particularly for analytical dashboards.",
  "sources": "Input datasets via function parameters (dataset), environment variables (indirectly through get_parser if implemented to access system info), and JSON data serialization.",
  "sinks": "JSON serialization (potential for data leakage if sensitive data is included), SQL query generation and execution (via get_metrics_sql and parser methods), and HTML rendering (to_chart_html).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input datasets to SQL query construction, then to database retrieval or data parsing, followed by JSON serialization and visualization rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. Usage of external functions and modules appears standard for data processing and visualization.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages data metrics retrieval and visualization. It uses safe practices such as parameterized SQL queries (via get_metrics_sql) and standard data serialization. No evidence of malicious intent, such as network connections to external servers, data exfiltration, or code injection techniques. The JSON encoder handles Decimal objects safely. Functionality appears limited to data processing, visualization, and SQL execution, with no suspicious side-effects or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for data analytics visualization and metrics retrieval, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks.",
