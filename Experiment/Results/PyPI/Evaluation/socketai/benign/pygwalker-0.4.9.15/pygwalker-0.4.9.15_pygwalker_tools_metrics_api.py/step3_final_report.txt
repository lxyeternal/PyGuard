{
  "purpose": "The code provides data retrieval, transformation, and visualization functionalities for user metrics and other analytics, relying on external parsers and SQL generators.",
  "sources": "Data sources include datasets, external parser functions, and SQL query generation functions.",
  "sinks": "Data flows from datasets through SQL queries, JSON serialization, and into visualization components.",
  "flows": "Source data -> SQL query via get_metrics_sql -> data retrieval via parser -> JSON serialization -> visualization rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries and practices for data handling and visualization. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. External functions are assumed safe based on context. Data serialization and SQL generation are performed using typical patterns, with no network activity or backdoors evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured data analytics and visualization module with no security concerns. The scores in the initial reports are justified, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1) reflecting external dependencies but no active threats.",
