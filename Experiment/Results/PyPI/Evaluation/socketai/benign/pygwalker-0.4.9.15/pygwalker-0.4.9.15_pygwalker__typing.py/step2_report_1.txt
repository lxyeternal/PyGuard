  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Overall Summary of the Code:**\n- The code conditionally imports multiple DataFrame libraries (pandas, modin, polars, pyspark.sql) during type checking (`if TYPE_CHECKING:`).\n- It appends available DataFrame classes to a list, then defines a `TypeVar` that encompasses all these types.\n- It also defines several string literal types for themes, appearance, and I/O modes.\n- All operations are static, for type hinting purposes, with no runtime data processing, network calls, or data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code; it is a standard pattern for supporting multiple optional dependencies for static type checking.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected. The code does not execute any data processing, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The logic is sound; conditional imports within `TYPE_CHECKING` are common for type hinting. The approach is safe and standard.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks; the code is purely for static type annotations.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The use of `try-except` blocks during type checking is a common pattern to handle optional dependencies gracefully.\n- The code does not perform any data handling or external communication.\n- The purpose is solely to support type hints across multiple DataFrame libraries, which is a safe and accepted practice.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**I agree with the reports' assessments that the code is benign and purely for static type hinting.** The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**In conclusion,** this code poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and is a standard, safe pattern for supporting multiple optional dependencies in type annotations.",
