{
  "purpose": "Define type variables for various DataFrame types and literal types for visualization themes, appearance, and I/O modes, primarily for type hinting and static analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (pandas, modin, polars, pyspark) conditionally during type checking; no runtime data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs are present; no untrusted data handling or output points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets up type variables and type annotations without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "The code conditionally imports modules during type checking, which is normal for type hints; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a list of DataFrame types based on available modules for type hinting. It includes safe, standard practices for optional dependencies. No data is read, written, or transmitted; no malicious code or backdoors are present. All operations are related to static type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for static type hinting and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It efficiently manages optional dependencies for different DataFrame libraries without executing dangerous or suspicious code.",
