{
  "purpose": "Defines type variables for various DataFrame types and string literals for themes, appearance, and IO modes, with conditional imports for type checking.",
  "sources": "Conditional imports within the 'if TYPE_CHECKING' block, which are used solely for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists as all imports are for type checking purposes only.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses conditional imports within a type checking block to dynamically append DataFrame types, which could be considered unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list for DataFrame types and conditionally appends DataFrame classes from pandas, modin, polars, and pyspark within a 'TYPE_CHECKING' block to avoid runtime import overhead. The purpose appears to be to support type annotations for multiple DataFrame types. The literals for themes, appearance, and IO modes are straightforward string unions. There are no network calls, data leaks, or malicious operations. The pattern of conditional imports is common in type hinting contexts to improve IDE support without runtime impact.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for type annotation purposes, supporting multiple DataFrame libraries. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or malicious code. The unusual use of conditional imports within 'TYPE_CHECKING' is benign and typical for type hints. Overall, the code appears safe and non-malicious.",
