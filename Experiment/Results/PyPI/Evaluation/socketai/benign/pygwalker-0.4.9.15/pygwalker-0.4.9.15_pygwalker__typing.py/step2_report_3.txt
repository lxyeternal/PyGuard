  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a setup for static type hinting, involving conditional imports of DataFrame libraries during type checking (`if TYPE_CHECKING`).\n- The code uses try-except blocks to safely handle optional dependencies, which is a common and accepted pattern.\n- No data is read, written, or transmitted; no external data sources or sinks are involved.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs.\n- The literals for themes and modes are straightforward string unions.\n- The code's purpose is purely for static analysis support, not runtime data processing.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with confidence levels at or near 1.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, which makes sense given the benign nature.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n- The code does not perform any runtime operations that could be malicious.\n- The pattern of conditional imports within `if TYPE_CHECKING` is standard for type hinting with optional dependencies.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all assessments correctly identify the code as safe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary; the reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a straightforward, safe setup for static type hinting with optional dependencies. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured for its purpose, and free from malicious intent. The scores and reasoning across all reports are justified and accurate.",
