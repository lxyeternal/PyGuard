  "purpose": "Support static type hinting for multiple optional DataFrame libraries by conditionally importing their classes during type checking.",
  "sources": "Conditional imports within 'if TYPE_CHECKING' block, attempting to import pandas, modin, polars, pyspark.sql DataFrame classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data flows; no runtime data processing, network activity, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "None; the code only defines type variables based on available modules during type checking.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward pattern for optional dependencies, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard conditional imports within 'if TYPE_CHECKING' to define a list of DataFrame types for static type annotations. It uses try-except blocks to handle missing optional dependencies gracefully. The purpose is solely for type hinting, with no runtime data processing or security-sensitive operations. The pattern is common and safe, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The code is clear, well-structured, and aligns with best practices for optional dependency handling in type annotations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for static type hinting support, with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe pattern; scores should reflect no malware, no obfuscation, and no security risk.",
