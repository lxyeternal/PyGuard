  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the actual code.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Code Summary:**\n\n- The code conditionally imports multiple DataFrame libraries during the `TYPE_CHECKING` phase to define a flexible `TypeVar` that encompasses all available DataFrame types.\n- It also defines some literal types for visualization themes, appearance modes, and I/O modes.\n- The imports are wrapped in try-except blocks, which is standard for optional dependencies.\n- No runtime data processing, external data input/output, or malicious behavior is present.\n- The code's purpose is solely for static type hinting and annotations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Critical Evaluation:\n\n**1. Are the reported issues present?**\n\n- **Type correctness:** The code correctly defines a list of DataFrame types based on available optional dependencies, which is standard practice.\n- **Malicious code or backdoors:** No evidence of such; the code is purely for static type hints.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; the code is straightforward.\n- **Data flow or security risks:** None. No data is processed or transmitted.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code does not execute data processing or network calls.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports correctly identify that the code is safe, with no malicious issues.\n\n---\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their reasoning.\n- They recognize the pattern of conditional imports within `if TYPE_CHECKING` as standard and benign.\n- No overstatements or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The explanations about the purpose and behavior are accurate.\n\n**No logical flaws or mistakes are identified in the reports.**\n\n---\n\n### Score Assessments:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very close to it, which aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n**However, the confidence levels vary slightly, but all are high (mostly 1 or 0.95), which is reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Scores > 0.5:\n\n- The code is not malicious, does not perform any harmful actions, and is standard for static type hinting.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n- The highest risk score should be 0, as there's no threat.\n\n---\n\n### Additional Observations:\n\n- The use of try-except blocks for optional dependencies is standard and safe.\n- The conditional import within `if TYPE_CHECKING` is a common pattern for type hints without runtime overhead.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should be **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Should be **0**.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value | Justification                                                 |\n|------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                   | No malicious behavior detected.                                |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                   | No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.                     |\n| Security Risk    | 0                   | No security vulnerabilities or risky operations present.      |\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion, all reports are accurate in their analysis and scoring. The code is safe, straightforward, and intended solely for static type checking support.**",
