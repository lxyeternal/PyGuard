{
  "purpose": "The code defines type variables for various DataFrame types from multiple data processing libraries, and literals for theme, appearance, and spec I/O modes, primarily to support type checking and annotations.",
  "sources": "The code reads optional import attempts for pandas, modin, polars, and pyspark.sql modules during type checking (inside the if TYPE_CHECKING block).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling are present; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "The flow involves conditional imports during type checking to build a list of supported DataFrame types, then creating a type variable with those types; literals are statically defined.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs conditional import attempts with exception handling, which is normal; no suspicious or obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs optional, safe import attempts for multiple DataFrame libraries within a type-checking block, appending available DataFrame classes to a list. It then defines a TypeVar that encompasses all detected DataFrame types. Additionally, it defines literal types for themes and modes. No external data input, output, or sensitive data handling occurs. The code's structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for type annotation support and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It performs safe, standard operations for a type hinting utility without any suspicious activities.",
