  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications, potential issues, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code primarily performs conditional imports within an `if TYPE_CHECKING` block, appending available DataFrame classes to a list for static type annotations.\n- The imports are wrapped in try-except blocks to handle missing modules gracefully.\n- No data processing, network calls, or runtime data flows are involved.\n- The code's purpose is purely for static type hinting support, with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- The pattern used is common in type hinting for optional dependencies, especially to avoid runtime overhead.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code itself. All operations are standard for static type hinting support.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **None detected:** The code is straightforward and adheres to common practices for optional dependency handling during type checking.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct. The code does not contain any malicious logic.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.95. Given the code's nature, a score of 0.0 is appropriate. The 0.95 in report 4 seems slightly high, but since the code is benign, I agree with a score of 0.\n\n### Justification for Scores:\n- **Malware (0):** No malicious activity or code.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk (0):** No security risk; no data leaks, no external communication, no vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential Assumptions or Claims:\n- Some reports mention the \"unusual\" pattern of conditional imports inside `if TYPE_CHECKING`. While slightly less common, this pattern is well-understood and accepted in static typing contexts. It is not suspicious or malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores:** All should be adjusted to:\n  - **Malware:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0\n  - **Risk:** 0\n\n- **Overall assessment:** The code is a benign, standard utility for static type hinting support with optional dependencies. No security concerns or malicious intent are present.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is safe, non-malicious, and typical for type hinting in Python projects with optional dependencies. The assigned scores in the reports are generally appropriate, with minor adjustments to risk and malware scores to reflect the benign nature.",
