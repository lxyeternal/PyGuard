{
  "purpose": "Define type variables for various DataFrame types and literal types for UI themes, appearance modes, and I/O modes, primarily for type hinting and static analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports modules conditionally based on availability, with no direct user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no runtime data flows or external data handling are involved.",
  "anomalies": "Conditional imports wrapped in try-except blocks are standard for optional dependencies; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscation or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically constructs a list of DataFrame types based on available optional dependencies, which is typical for flexible type hinting in complex projects. It includes safe, non-malicious use of try-except for optional module imports. The rest of the code assigns type variables and literals for later use. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard approach to defining flexible type hints for various DataFrame libraries and literal types. There are no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
