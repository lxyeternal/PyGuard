  "purpose": "Define byte size limits and determine the root directory path of the current script.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ variable to determine the script's file path.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "The script uses the __file__ variable to set ROOT_DIR; no data flows to external sinks or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets constants for Jupyter notebook size limits and computes the directory of the current script. It relies on __file__ to determine the script's location, which is standard practice. No dynamic code execution, data leakage, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and benign, intended to set configuration constants and locate the script directory. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
