  "purpose": "Define byte size limits for Jupyter notebooks and widgets, and determine the root directory of the current script.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath(__file__)",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present in the code",
  "flows": "None; code only defines constants and a directory path",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard usage of os.path functions and constants",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module, sets constants for byte limits using bitwise shifts, and determines the directory of the current script file. All operations are straightforward, with no use of untrusted input, dynamic code execution, or sensitive data handling. The constants could be used later for file size restrictions, and the ROOT_DIR is set to the script's directory, which is common practice.\n\nThere are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks in these lines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration or setup for a larger script. No malicious or suspicious activity is present.",
