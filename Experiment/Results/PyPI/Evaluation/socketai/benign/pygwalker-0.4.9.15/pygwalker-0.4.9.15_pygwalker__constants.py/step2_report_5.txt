  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code solely defines constants related to byte size limits (`JUPYTER_BYTE_LIMIT`, `JUPYTER_WIDGETS_BYTE_LIMIT`) and determines the script's directory (`ROOT_DIR`) using `os.path.abspath(__file__)`.\n   - The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, dynamic code execution, or handle untrusted input.\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and typical for configuration purposes.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies:**\n   - No report indicates any suspicious or malicious activity.\n   - No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are observed.\n   - The use of `__file__` and bitwise shifts for constants is standard practice.\n\n3. **Scores & Reasoning:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature—benign configuration code with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports assume the code is only for configuration, which appears accurate.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities, exploits, or malicious intent.\n   - The code does not handle untrusted data, nor does it perform risky operations.\n\n5. **Final Assessment & Recommendations:**\n   - Given the evidence, the code is benign, with no security risks.\n   - The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n   - No modifications are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign configuration setup. The scores are justified and should remain as-is.",
