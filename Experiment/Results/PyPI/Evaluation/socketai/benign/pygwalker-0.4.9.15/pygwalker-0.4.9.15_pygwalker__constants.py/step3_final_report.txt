  "purpose": "Define size limit constants for Jupyter notebooks and determine the script's directory path.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it uses __file__ to determine its own location.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external outputs; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports os, defines two constants using bitwise shifts for size limits, and assigns ROOT_DIR based on __file__. It performs no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. All reports agree on its benign nature, with appropriate scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and a confidence of 1. The code's purpose appears to be configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign configuration snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
