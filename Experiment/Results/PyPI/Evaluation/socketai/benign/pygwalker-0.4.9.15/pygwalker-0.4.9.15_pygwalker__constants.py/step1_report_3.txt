  "purpose": "Define byte size limits for Jupyter notebooks and widgets, and set a root directory path.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ variable to determine the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code only initializes constants and a directory path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code only assigns static constants and a directory path.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'os' module, defines two constants for size limits, and sets 'ROOT_DIR' to the absolute directory of the current script. There is no user input, external data, or untrusted data processing. The constants appear to configure limits possibly used elsewhere, and the directory path is standard. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defining configuration constants and a directory path without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
