  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Code Content Confirmation**  \nThe code simply imports `os`, defines two constants (`JUPYTER_BYTE_LIMIT` and `JUPYTER_WIDGETS_BYTE_LIMIT`) using bitwise shifts, and assigns `ROOT_DIR` based on `__file__`. There are no dynamic inputs, no external data handling, no code execution, and no network activity. The code appears to be a straightforward configuration snippet.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Reports**  \nAll reports agree that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. They consistently note that the code's purpose is to set constants and determine the script's directory, which is standard practice.\n\n**3. Logical and Reasoning Flaws**  \n- No flaws or errors are evident in the reports' reasoning. They correctly interpret the code's intent and structure.  \n- The reports do not claim or imply any vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond the benign analysis.\n\n**4. Scores and Justification**  \n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.  \n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating the code is not obfuscated.  \n- The securityRisk score is 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**5. Potential Risks and Assumptions**  \n- The code only sets constants and a directory path. There are no assumptions about malicious behavior.  \n- The constants relate to Jupyter Notebook size limits, which are common configuration parameters.\n\n**6. Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores**  \n- The scores are consistent across reports and reasonable given the code content.  \n- No changes are necessary to the scores.\n\n**7. Final Assessment and Recommendations**  \n- Based on the code and reports, the overall malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at 0.  \n- The confidence level is high (1), which is appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is straightforward, with no malicious or suspicious elements.  \n- The reports are accurate and consistent.  \n- The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code is benign, with no security concerns.",
