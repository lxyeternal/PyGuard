  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n1. **Code Verification**:\n   - The original code only imports `os`, defines two constants (`JUPYTER_BYTE_LIMIT`, `JUPYTER_WIDGETS_BYTE_LIMIT`) using bitwise shifts, and assigns `ROOT_DIR` based on `__file__`.\n   - No dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or data handling is present.\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and typical for configuration purposes.\n\n2. **Logical and Reasoning Flaws**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is simple, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n   - They uniformly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation.\n   - No flawed reasoning or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Justification**:\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The constants are typical configuration parameters, likely used elsewhere.\n   - The use of `__file__` is standard for determining script location.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - Scores of zero for malware and security risk are appropriate.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they only describe what the code does.\n   - No unwarranted claims are made.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores align well with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No inconsistencies detected.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious intent or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a straightforward configuration snippet that sets constants for byte limits and determines the script's directory. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The uniformity and correctness of the reports' conclusions are appropriate.\n\n**Summary**: I agree with the provided scores. No modifications are necessary.",
