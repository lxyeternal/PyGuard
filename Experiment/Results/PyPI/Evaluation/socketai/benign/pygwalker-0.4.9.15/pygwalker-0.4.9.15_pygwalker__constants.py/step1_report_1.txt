  "purpose": "Define constants related to byte limits and determine the root directory of the current script.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath(__file__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; only variable assignments and function calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns constants and the root directory.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the os module, defines two constants for byte limits (likely related to Jupyter Notebook configurations), and assigns ROOT_DIR to the directory containing the current script. The use of __file__ to determine the script's directory is standard. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code appears to serve a configuration or setup purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply sets configuration constants and the script directory, which is typical in setup scripts.",
