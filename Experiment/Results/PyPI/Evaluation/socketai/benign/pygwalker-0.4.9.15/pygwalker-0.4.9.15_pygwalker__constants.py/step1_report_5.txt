  "purpose": "Define byte limits for Jupyter notebooks and widgets, and set the root directory based on the script's location.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath(__file__) - retrieves the current file path",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external output",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple variable definitions and directory resolution",
  "analysis": "The code initializes constants for byte size limits for Jupyter notebooks and widgets. It also determines the root directory based on the current script's location. All operations are standard and do not involve data input, external communication, or security-sensitive operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, setting constants and paths without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
