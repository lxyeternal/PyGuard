  "purpose": "Download a CSV dataset from a specified URL into a local directory.",
  "sources": "The URL string in the code, the os.makedirs call, and the urlretrieve function.",
  "sinks": "The urlretrieve function which writes the downloaded file to disk.",
  "flows": "From the hardcoded URL to the local directory via urlretrieve, with directory creation beforehand.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard library usage and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple download of a public CSV file into a local directory, creating the directory if needed. It uses standard libraries, with minimal error handling. No obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious network activity are present. The URL points to a benign dataset. The code does not verify file integrity or perform validation, but this does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard dataset downloader with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
