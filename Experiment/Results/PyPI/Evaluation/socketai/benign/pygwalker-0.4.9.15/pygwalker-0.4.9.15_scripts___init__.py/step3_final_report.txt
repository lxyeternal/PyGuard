  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code inputs, data reads, environment variables, network calls, data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable accesses, data leaks, command executions.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks through data processing, network functions, or environment interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate benign code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Confidence levels align with the amount of available information. Malware scores are uniformly zero, and security risks are minimal (0.1-0.2), reflecting conservative assessments given limited code visibility. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the provided analyses. No revisions are necessary.",
