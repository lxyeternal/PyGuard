  "purpose": "CLI script for configuring and logging into the pygwalker data visualization tool.",
  "sources": "User input from command-line arguments, specifically the '--set' and '--reset' options in the 'config' command.",
  "sinks": "Functions that perform configuration updates (set_config, reset_config, reset_all_config) and the kanaries_login function, which may initiate authentication processes.",
  "flows": "User inputs '--set' or '--reset' parameters -> command_set_config/command_reset_config called -> configuration functions invoked; 'login' command triggers kanaries_login.",
  "anomalies": "Use of command-line arguments to modify configurations directly; no hardcoded secrets or credentials found; no suspicious external data sources; the code appears to be straightforward CLI logic.",
  "analysis": "The script provides CLI commands for configuration management and login functionality. It imports configuration and login modules. User input via command-line arguments is parsed and used to call configuration functions or trigger login. No evidence of malicious code such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. The 'kanaries_login' function's internal behavior is not detailed here, so potential risks depend on its implementation, but based on this code alone, there are no indications of malicious intent. The code performs standard CLI parsing and function dispatching, with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI interface for configuration and login operations, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks evident in this snippet. The only potential concern is reliance on external modules whose behavior is unknown, but within this code, there are no malicious indicators.",
