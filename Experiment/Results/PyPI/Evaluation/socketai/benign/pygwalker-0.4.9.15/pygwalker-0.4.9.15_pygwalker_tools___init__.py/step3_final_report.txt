  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code anomalies, suspicious patterns, and potential malware indicators.",
  "sources": "Code segments involving dynamic code execution ('eval'/'exec'), reading environment variables, user input, hardcoded secrets, network connections, or data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, system commands, file operations, or data leaks where untrusted input could lead to malicious actions or information disclosure.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network communication or system execution, especially when combined with dynamic code execution or hardcoded secrets.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'eval'/'exec' with untrusted data, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, complex or misleading variable names, or unusual code structures that hinder analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution ('eval'/'exec'), hardcoded secrets, and obfuscation, which are typical indicators of malicious intent. The confidence in these findings is high due to the direct presence of these constructs. The flow from untrusted sources to sinks via eval/exec signifies potential for code injection or malicious control. The anomalies are consistent with obfuscation and concealment tactics. Given these factors, the overall security risk is elevated, and malware likelihood is significant. The analysis aligns with a malware score of approximately 0.6, reflecting probable malicious behavior, and an obfuscated score of 0.6, indicating suspicion. The confidence score is 0.8, considering the direct evidence of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains notable malicious indicators, including dynamic code execution and obfuscation, warranting a high security alert. While not definitively confirmed as malicious, the presence of these patterns justifies a malware score of 0.6 and a security risk score of 0.6. The anomalies suggest potential sabotage or malicious activity, and further manual review is recommended to confirm intent.",
