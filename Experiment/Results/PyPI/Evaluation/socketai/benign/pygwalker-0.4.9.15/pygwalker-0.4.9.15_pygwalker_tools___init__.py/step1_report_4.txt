  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated; it appears to perform some data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment variables and input data from function parameters or external sources.",
  "sinks": "Data may be written to files, sent over network connections, or stored in variables; specific sinks are not clearly identifiable without detailed code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions to processing functions, possibly leading to outputs or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, but some complex or unnecessary dynamic execution patterns could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent, though none are evident here.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform standard processing with safe library usage. There are no signs of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity. It does not contain obfuscated patterns or unusual language features. Without external context, it looks like typical utility code. No anomalies indicative of malicious intent are detected. The structure and format are consistent with normal Python code. Overall, the code appears benign with no security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard, well-structured Python code performing typical functions. No malicious signals or anomalies detected.",
