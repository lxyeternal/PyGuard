The main security concern is the lack of input validation, which could be exploited if malicious JSON commands are provided. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3. Implementing input validation or command whitelisting is recommended to mitigate potential misuse."
