  "purpose": "A command-line utility for building Python package distributions (sdist, wheel, editable), primarily for debugging PEP-517 backends.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments parsed via argparse; input parameters include source directory, output directory, and build options.",
  "sinks": "Outputs build logs and errors directly to stdout and stderr.",
  "flows": "User provides CLI args -> args parsed -> build commands invoked via SubprocessFrontend -> build outputs printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper that delegates build tasks to an external SubprocessFrontend. It uses standard libraries and patterns, with no evidence of malicious activity. The subprocess interactions are external and depend on the implementation of SubprocessFrontend, but within this code, there are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity. The print statements are typical for logging build output. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to reliance on external subprocesses, which is common in build tools but outside the scope of this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, transparent build frontend with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and suitable for use in secure environments.",
