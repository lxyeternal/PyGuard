  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The code is a straightforward build frontend script that invokes build commands via a subprocess frontend. It only logs outputs and errors, with no signs of malicious activity or anomalies.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent, no malicious behavior detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and standard.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid, safe, and typical for its purpose.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the subprocess frontend is external and the code is standard. No malicious patterns or secrets are present.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, primarily because it relies on external subprocesses, which could be a vector if malicious, but no evidence here.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate build helper, no security issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same pattern — a CLI orchestrator for build commands, relying on an external subprocess frontend. No suspicious code or activity.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — still low, considering external subprocesses, but no evidence of malicious intent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe, with dependency on external subprocess implementation.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, standard CLI for building packages, no suspicious activity.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward code.  \n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — low, primarily due to reliance on subprocesses.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion — a CLI wrapper around subprocess build commands, no malicious patterns or anomalies.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear code.  \n- **Security risk:** 0 — no evident vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is standard, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. It is a typical build frontend script that delegates work to subprocesses.  \n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident. The reliance on external subprocesses is typical for such tools, but it does not introduce security risks within this code snippet.  \n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate. Security risks are minimal, reflecting the low likelihood of malicious activity.  \n- **Justification for higher scores:** None of the reports justify a malware score above 0.5; given the code's simplicity and transparency, higher scores are unwarranted.  \n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about the subprocess implementation, and the code itself does not process untrusted data in a dangerous way.  \n- **Overall risk estimate:** Based on all reports, the code appears benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores for the entire code:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk:** **0** — no security risks detected in the code itself.\n\nThis assessment aligns with all reports and the code's nature. The overall security posture of this script is very good, assuming the external subprocess implementations are also secure and trustworthy.",
