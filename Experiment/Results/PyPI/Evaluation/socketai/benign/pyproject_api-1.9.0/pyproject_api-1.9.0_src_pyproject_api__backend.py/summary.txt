  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward backend command dispatcher with dynamic module loading and method invocation. No malware or obfuscation is detected. The main security concern is the lack of input validation, which could be exploited if malicious JSON commands are provided. The assigned scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3. Implementing input validation or command whitelisting is recommended to mitigate potential misuse."
