  "purpose": "Provides version metadata for the package, including version string and tuple.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version string and tuple; conditional import for type checking.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static data assignment without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, auto-generated code with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static version information module generated by setuptools_scm. It conditionally imports typing constructs for type hints and assigns fixed version strings and tuples. There are no inputs, external data sources, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. The code contains no obfuscation, malicious actions, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate benign, standard version metadata code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature and are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and poses no security threat. The reports correctly identify its nature and assign appropriate scores. No modifications are necessary.",
