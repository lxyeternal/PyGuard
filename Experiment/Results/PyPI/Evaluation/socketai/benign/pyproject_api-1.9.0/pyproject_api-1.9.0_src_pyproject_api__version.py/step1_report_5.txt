  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm, primarily for internal use and version tracking.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, and conditional import for type checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external input or data output points present.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version data to variables, with conditional import logic based on type checking.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward version metadata with standard practices. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables for a Python package. It uses conditional logic to include type annotations only during type checking, which is a common pattern. No external data is read, and no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs. The code is typical for package versioning and contains no harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a metadata declaration for package versioning. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
