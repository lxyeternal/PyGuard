  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples; conditional import for type checking.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, no user input processing.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version variables; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward version metadata definition with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports typing components only for type checking purposes, which is a common pattern. It then assigns version strings and tuples statically. There are no inputs, no data flow from untrusted sources, and no malicious behavior. The code does not perform any I/O operations, network communications, or dynamic code execution. It is a simple metadata module generated by setuptools_scm, used to define the package version.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated version metadata snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. It contains no malware or obfuscated code and presents no security threats.",
