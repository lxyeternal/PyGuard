  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version strings and tuples; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version strings and tuples; no flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version information for a package with static, hardcoded version strings and tuples. It includes type checking conditional imports, but all values are hardcoded. There are no dynamic executions, input reads, or network interactions. The purpose is purely to store version metadata, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version declaration snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
