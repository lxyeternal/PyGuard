{
  "purpose": "This code defines version-related variables for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, primarily for version management and type checking.",
  "sources": "The code assigns version strings and tuples directly within the script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing points are present.",
  "flows": "The version string and tuple are assigned directly from hardcoded values; there are no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated constructs, or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears standard for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports typing constructs for type checking and assigns version information directly as hardcoded strings and tuples. There are no input sources, data processing, or external communications. The structure is typical for auto-generated version info, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. No anomalies or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign auto-generated version definition module with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It simply manages version metadata for the package.",
