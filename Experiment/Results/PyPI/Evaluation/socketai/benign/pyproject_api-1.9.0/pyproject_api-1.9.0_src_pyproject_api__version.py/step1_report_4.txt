{
  "purpose": "This code sets version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, for internal use during development and deployment.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only assigns static version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks, code injection, or other vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists; the code merely defines variables with static values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets beyond version strings, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The use of TYPE_CHECKING is standard for type hints and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward generated version file for package versioning, involving static variable assignments and conditional type hint imports. No dynamic or untrusted data handling, external input, or suspicious behavior is observed. It adheres to typical conventions for such files. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and purely for version management within a package. It contains no malicious behavior or security issues.",
