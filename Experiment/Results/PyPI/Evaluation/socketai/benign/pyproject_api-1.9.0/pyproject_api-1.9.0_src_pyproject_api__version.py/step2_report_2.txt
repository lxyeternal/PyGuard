  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Review:**\n\n- The code is a standard auto-generated version metadata snippet, created by setuptools_scm.\n- It conditionally imports typing constructs for type hints, which is a common pattern.\n- It assigns version strings and tuples directly as hardcoded values.\n- There are no inputs, external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code contains no obfuscation, no suspicious constructs, and no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment of Security and Maliciousness:**\n\n- The code is purely static data assignment for versioning purposes.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources.\n- No external dependencies or dynamic behavior.\n- No indication of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk; the code is benign.\n\n**Potential Issues in the Reports:**\n\n- The reports consistently state that the code is benign, with confidence 1, and no anomalies.\n- They correctly identify the code as standard version metadata, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The reasoning is sound and aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is a typical, auto-generated version information module.\n- The reports' assessments are accurate.\n- No changes needed in the scoring or reasoning.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n\n- Based on the code and reports, I would assign the following scores:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\n- These reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, auto-generated version metadata snippet with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify this, and no adjustments are necessary.",
