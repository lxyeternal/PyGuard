  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard directory cleanup utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Its potential for misuse exists if invoked on critical directories, but the code itself is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk primarily due to the destructive nature of its operation if misused."
