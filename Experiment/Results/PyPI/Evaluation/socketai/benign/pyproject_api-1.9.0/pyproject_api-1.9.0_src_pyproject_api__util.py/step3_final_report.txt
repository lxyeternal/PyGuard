  "purpose": "Ensure that the specified directory is empty by deleting its contents or creating it if it does not exist.",
  "sources": "Filesystem path provided as argument to the function; checks for existence, directory status, and iterates over directory contents.",
  "sinks": "Deletion of files and directories via unlink() and rmtree(); creation of directories via mkdir().",
  "flows": "Checks if path exists -> if directory, deletes contents -> if file, deletes file and creates directory -> if not exists, creates directory.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ignore_errors=True in rmtree(), which may hide errors during deletion but is a common pattern in cleanup routines.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard filesystem functions to ensure a directory is empty, deleting files and subdirectories as needed. No external inputs, network activity, or secrets are involved. The logic is straightforward and safe. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The use of ignore_errors=True could hide errors but does not introduce security issues. Overall, the code is a standard utility with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard directory cleanup utility with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Its potential for misuse exists if invoked on critical directories, but the code itself is benign. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk primarily due to the destructive nature of its operation if misused.",
