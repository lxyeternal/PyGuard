  "purpose": "The code ensures that a specified directory is empty by deleting its contents if it exists or creating it if it does not.",
  "sources": "The code reads the path provided as an argument to check existence, directory status, and contents.",
  "sinks": "The code deletes files and directories using unlink() and rmtree(), and creates directories with mkdir().",
  "flows": "Input path -> checks existence and directory status -> deletes files/subdirectories -> creates empty directory if needed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of standard library functions with no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The function 'ensure_empty_dir' safely manipulates the filesystem to guarantee an empty directory at the given path. It handles existing files and directories by removing them, including nested directories, and creates the directory if it does not exist. All operations are standard and intended for directory management. No malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is present. The code uses standard Python functions in a typical manner for filesystem cleanup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility for directory management with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard filesystem operations to ensure a directory is empty, with no malicious behavior or anomalies detected.",
