  "purpose": "Ensure that a specified directory path is empty by deleting its contents or creating it if it doesn't exist.",
  "sources": "Reads the filesystem to check if the path exists, whether it is a directory, and iterates over directory contents.",
  "sinks": "Deletes files and directories using unlink() and rmtree(). Creates directories with mkdir().",
  "flows": "Checks existence of path -> deletes directory contents or the path itself -> recreates directory if necessary.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Usage of shutil.rmtree and unlink is standard for directory cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard directory management: verifying existence, cleaning contents, and creating directories. No external data sources, no network access, no untrusted input processing beyond filesystem checks. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility function for managing filesystem directories, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
