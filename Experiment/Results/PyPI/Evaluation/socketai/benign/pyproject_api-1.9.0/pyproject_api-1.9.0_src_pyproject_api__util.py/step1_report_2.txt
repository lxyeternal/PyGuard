  "purpose": "Ensure that a specified directory is empty by deleting its contents and recreating it if necessary.",
  "sources": "Reads the filesystem to check existence, directory status, and iterates over directory contents.",
  "sinks": "Deletes files and directories using unlink() and rmtree(), and creates directories with mkdir().",
  "flows": "Checks if path exists -> deletes contents if directory -> deletes file if not -> recreates directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code. Uses standard library functions appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to ensure a directory is empty. It safely checks for existence, removes all contents if it exists, and creates a new directory if needed. Uses standard shutil and pathlib functions with no suspicious or malicious behavior. No external data flows or obfuscated code present. The logic is straightforward for directory management.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard filesystem operation to clear or create a directory, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for cleanup tasks.",
