  "purpose": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for a build backend interface, executing controlled code snippets and subprocess calls within a testing environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads code snippets from files, environment variables, and dynamically generated code within test functions.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess executions of code snippets, environment variable manipulations, and file I/O operations, all within controlled test scenarios.",
  "flows": "Sources (code snippets, environment variables) are executed via subprocess calls; no untrusted data flows outside the test context.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables to induce faulty behaviors or simulate malicious scenarios, but confined to testing environment; no malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests for a build backend interface, involving subprocess calls, environment variable manipulations, and file operations. All snippets are controlled and used solely for testing purposes. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are detected. The subprocess executions are within a controlled environment, and no untrusted input is executed outside testing. The use of environment variables to simulate errors is standard testing practice. The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated. The overall security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a very low risk score (~0.1), justified by the execution of code snippets in subprocesses, which could be dangerous if misused outside testing but are safe here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a controlled, well-structured test suite with no malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The subprocess calls execute only controlled test snippets, and no malicious activity or data exfiltration is evident. The overall security risk is negligible.",
