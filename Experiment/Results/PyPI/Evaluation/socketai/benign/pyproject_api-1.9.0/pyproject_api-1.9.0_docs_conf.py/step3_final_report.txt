  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation, setting extensions, themes, and a custom class override to fix cross-reference resolution issues.",
  "sources": "Static imports (__version__), configuration variables, class override within setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or file operations; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only static configuration and class patching.",
  "anomalies": "A benign override of resolve_xref in a custom class, intended as a fix for documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Sphinx configuration with a minor, harmless class override. It does not process user input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The override simply remaps a specific cross-reference target, which is a standard fix. No security vulnerabilities, malware, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static configuration script with a benign class override. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate, and the code can be considered secure and non-malicious.",
