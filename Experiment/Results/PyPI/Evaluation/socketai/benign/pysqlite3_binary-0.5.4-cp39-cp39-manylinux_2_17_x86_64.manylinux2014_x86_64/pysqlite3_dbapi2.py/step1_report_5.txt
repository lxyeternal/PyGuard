{
  "purpose": "Provide an interface for SQLite database interaction, including date and time conversions and adapters.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (datetime, time, collections.abc), reads version strings, and registers adapters/converters.",
  "sinks": "Uses functions like register_adapter and register_converter, which register conversion functions for database data types.",
  "flows": "Imports version info and functions that are registered as adapters/converters, which process data from the database.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or hidden behaviors. The code is mainly setup/configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines date/time conversion functions, registers them for use with a database API, and manipulates version info. No input/output streams or network calls are present. The logic is straightforward and typical for database adapters. No malicious code or backdoors are evident. It does not perform any data exfiltration, system modification, or suspicious activities. The code is standard setup code for database type conversions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a database API interface with date/time conversions and no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
