  "purpose": "Package initializer that re-exports components from pysqlite3.dbapi2, serving as a module import point.",
  "sources": "Import statement from pysqlite3.dbapi2",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; only a straightforward import",
  "flows": "Import from external module to namespace; no data flow or processing",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal and standard, with only comments and an import",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and an import statement, with no functions, variables, or dynamic code execution. It relies on an external trusted module, and there are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks. The import could be a vector if the external module is compromised, but the code itself does not facilitate malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the simplicity and trust assumptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a straightforward package initializer. The security risk depends on the trustworthiness of the external dependency, but the code itself shows no malicious intent or obfuscation.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
