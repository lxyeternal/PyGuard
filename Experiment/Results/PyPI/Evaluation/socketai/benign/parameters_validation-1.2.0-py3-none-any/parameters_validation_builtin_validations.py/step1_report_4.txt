{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of parameter validation functions to enforce type, null, blank, whitespace, and size constraints on input parameters, intended to ensure data integrity and correctness before further processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to validation functions such as 'param', 'string', 'obj', 'number', and their associated 'arg_name' and 'arg_type' arguments.",
  "sinks": "Validation checks and exception raising; no data sinks that transmit or leak data externally or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into validation functions, which evaluate their types, nullity, emptiness, or whitespace conditions, then either pass silently or raise exceptions; no external data or untrusted source flows beyond these functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are present. All functions perform standard validation routines. The '_build_arg' function concatenates argument info for error messages but does not execute dynamic code or access external data. No obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements validation logic for input parameters with exception handling for validation failures. Usage of try-except blocks is limited to error reporting, not executing untrusted code or accessing external resources. The functions rely on standard type and size checks. No network operations, file manipulations, or external data leaks are present. The '_build_arg' helper constructs descriptive argument strings for exceptions without executing code or involving external inputs. Overall, the code is well-structured, standard, and appears safe from malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of parameter validation functions aimed at ensuring data correctness. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The implementation is straightforward and secure, with no suspicious external interactions or potential for exploitation.",
