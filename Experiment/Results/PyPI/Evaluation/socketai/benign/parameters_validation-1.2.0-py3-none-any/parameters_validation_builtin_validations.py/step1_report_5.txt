{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of parameter validation decorators for enforcing types, non-null, non-blank, non-empty, no whitespace, and non-negative constraints on function arguments.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as 'param', 'string', 'obj', 'number', and their associated argument name and type strings.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data for effects like data exfiltration, code execution, or system manipulation. No network operations, file writes, or external commands are present.",
  "flows": "The data flows from input parameters through validation functions, which raise exceptions if validation fails, but there are no malicious or harmful data flows to external systems or sensitive information extraction.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard validation logic without obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden malicious behavior. The use of try-except blocks is for validation error handling, not malicious purposes. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs parameter validation via decorators and helper functions, enforcing types, nullity, emptiness, whitespace, and non-negativity. It employs exception handling for validation errors and constructs descriptive error messages. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, system modifications, or secret extraction. The code is clean, well-structured, and purpose-driven for input validation without any embedded malware or sabotage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard parameter validation utility with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to validate input parameters, raising exceptions on invalid inputs. No malicious behaviors or supply chain attacks are detected.",
