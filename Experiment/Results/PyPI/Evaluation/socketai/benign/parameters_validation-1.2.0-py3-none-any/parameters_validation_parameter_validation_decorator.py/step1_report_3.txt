{
  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator for parameter validation functions, enabling flexible validation logic with nested validation support.",
  "sources": "The code reads function arguments, decorator inputs, and inspect module to analyze function signatures.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that process untrusted input for security-sensitive operations like file access, network communication, or data storage.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated through nested validation functions; no untrusted data flows into external systems or sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses reflection (inspect) and dynamic function wrapping but does not exhibit suspicious obfuscation or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator for parameter validation that inspects function signatures and dynamically constructs validation functions. It supports nested validation objects, adding flexibility. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system harm. The code's structure and imports are standard and do not indicate obfuscation. The primary concern might be misuse if validation functions are improperly implemented externally, but within this code, nothing malicious is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard parameter validation utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs introspection and dynamic wrapping securely without executing untrusted data or external commands.",
