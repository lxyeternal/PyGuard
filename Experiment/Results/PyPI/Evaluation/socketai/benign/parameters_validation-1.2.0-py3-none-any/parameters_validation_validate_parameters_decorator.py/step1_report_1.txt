{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator for parameter validation in functions, allowing validation logic to be injected, mocked, or skipped.",
  "sources": "The code reads function specifications via inspect.getfullargspec, annotations, and input arguments passed to wrapped functions.",
  "sinks": "The code executes validation functions on parameters, and the only potential concern is the execution of user-provided validation functions passed as annotations or mocks.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> annotations validation functions -> execution within wrapper -> optional mocking or skipping validation",
  "anomalies": "Use of deepcopy on validation functions may be unnecessary but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no external network or system modification; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a parameter validation system with mechanisms for mocking validations or skipping them entirely. It uses inspect to analyze function signatures, applies validation functions if annotated, and allows mocking these validations for testing. The deepcopy of validation functions could be considered unusual but is not malicious. There are no external data leaks, network calls, or system modifications. The validation functions are executed locally on parameters, which is expected. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign parameter validation decorator with support for mocking and skipping validations. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident. It does not perform any harmful operations or external communications.",
