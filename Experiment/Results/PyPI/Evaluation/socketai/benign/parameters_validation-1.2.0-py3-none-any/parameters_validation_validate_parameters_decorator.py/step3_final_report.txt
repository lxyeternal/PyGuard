  "purpose": "A parameter validation decorator that uses annotations and allows mocking or skipping validations, designed to enforce parameter constraints before function execution.",
  "sources": "Function's full argument specification, including args, defaults, kwonlydefaults, and annotations.",
  "sinks": "Execution of user-defined validation functions on parameters; potential execution of malicious code if validation functions are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Parameters are collected into a dict, then validation functions (annotations) are called with parameter values; validation mocks can replace real validations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deepcopy on validation functions is unusual; no external network or file operations; no obfuscation or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code inspects function signatures, applies validations via annotations, and supports mocking and skipping. Validation functions are executed on parameters, which could be malicious if supplied externally. The use of deepcopy on functions is unconventional but not malicious. No external side effects or malicious payloads are present. The main risk is executing untrusted validation functions, which is inherent to such validation frameworks but not a flaw in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign validation utility with no embedded malicious behavior. The primary security concern is the execution of user-supplied validation functions, which could be malicious if untrusted. The malware score should remain at 0, as no malicious code is present. The risk score should be increased to approximately 0.5 to reflect the potential for malicious validation functions to execute arbitrary code if supplied from untrusted sources.",
