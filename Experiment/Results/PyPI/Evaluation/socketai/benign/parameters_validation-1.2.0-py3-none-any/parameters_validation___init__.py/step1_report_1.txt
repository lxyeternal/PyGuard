  "purpose": "This code defines module exports for parameter validation functions and decorators, intended for use in validating input parameters in other parts of the application.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'parameters_validation' modules at the beginning of the file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; the code only exports imported functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; this is merely an export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be straightforward import and export statements without any dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific validation functions and decorators from the 'parameters_validation' package. It then defines the __all__ variable to specify what symbols are publicly exported from this module. The code structure is standard for Python modules intended for re-exporting selected functions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are present. The import statements are static, and the __all__ list is explicitly defined. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or data leaks. The module appears to be a clean, conventional Python code fragment for managing exports.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign Python module used to re-export validation functions and decorators. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
