{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports validation functions and decorators related to parameter validation, likely used for input validation in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'parameters_validation' package importing specific validation functions and decorators.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or malicious operations are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The imported functions and decorators are made available for use elsewhere; no data flow involving untrusted input occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward module setup with no unusual or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several validation functions and decorators from an external package and re-exports them in __all__ for public use. All imported elements are standard validation utilities, and there are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure and format are typical for a module intended for validation purposes. There are no anomalies or suspicious constructs. The code is purely declarative and setup-oriented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module setup for validation utilities with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely as an export list, with no complex logic or potential attack vectors.",
