  "purpose": "Re-export validation functions and decorators from the 'parameters_validation' package for external use.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'parameters_validation' modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "Import of functions/decorators -> assignment to __all__ for module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static, straightforward, with no dynamic or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific validation functions and decorators from an external package and re-exports them via __all__. It contains no logic, data processing, network activity, or obfuscation. The code's purpose is purely to organize and expose validation utilities. No signs of malicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The simplicity and static nature of the code strongly suggest benign intent. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are consistent with the code's structure and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static module that re-exports validation functions and decorators. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores and assessments are appropriate and justified.",
