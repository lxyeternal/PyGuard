{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that exposes functions for generating random data for binary, binned binary, and multiclass datasets, likely for testing or benchmarking purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing functions from 'torcheval.utils.random_data', which is an external library or module.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet that handle untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present in this code snippet; it mainly re-exports functions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior detected. The code simply imports and exports functions.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, importing three functions from a module and exposing them via __all__ for external use. It contains no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external network connections. The license comment indicates it is an open-source component from Meta. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent in the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves as a simple interface for random data generation functions. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided content.",
