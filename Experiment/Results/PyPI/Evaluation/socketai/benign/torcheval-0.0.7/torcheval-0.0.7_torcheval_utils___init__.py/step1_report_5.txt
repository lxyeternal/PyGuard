{
  "purpose": "The code exports functions for generating random data, likely for testing or simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from 'torcheval.utils.random_data', which is a third-party library or internal module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only defines exports. No untrusted data handling or external communication is visible.",
  "flows": "The module imports functions and re-exports them; no data flow beyond that.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code is straightforward, with licensing comments, imports, and export declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific functions from a 'torcheval.utils.random_data' module and re-exports them via __all__. The license comment indicates it's from Meta and under BSD-style license. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present. No data processing, network activity, or sensitive information handling is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple re-export module for functions generating random data. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
