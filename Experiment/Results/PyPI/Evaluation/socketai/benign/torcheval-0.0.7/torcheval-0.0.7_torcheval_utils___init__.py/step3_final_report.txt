  "purpose": "A simple module that imports specific functions from 'torcheval.utils.random_data' and re-exports them for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'torcheval.utils.random_data'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Import of functions from the module, then re-export via __all__; no data flow beyond module boundaries.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; standard import/export pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, straightforward interface module that imports three functions and exposes them via __all__. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or data processing is present. The license comment indicates open-source origin from Meta. The code does not perform any malicious actions, handle untrusted data, or contain obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No anomalies or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility interface with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and reflect the straightforward, safe nature of the code.",
