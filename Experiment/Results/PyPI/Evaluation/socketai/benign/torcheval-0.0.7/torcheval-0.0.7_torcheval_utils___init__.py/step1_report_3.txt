{
  "purpose": "The code provides import statements for functions related to generating random data for binary, binned binary, and multiclass datasets, likely for testing or benchmarking purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports functions from the 'torcheval.utils.random_data' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only imports functions and does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present as the code only contains import statements and an export list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious constructs; the code is straightforward and adheres to common import/export patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions from a utility module, presumably for generating random data. There is no data processing, user input, network activity, or other potentially malicious behavior. The license comment indicates open-source licensing from Meta Platforms, and no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple module export list for utility functions related to random data generation. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
