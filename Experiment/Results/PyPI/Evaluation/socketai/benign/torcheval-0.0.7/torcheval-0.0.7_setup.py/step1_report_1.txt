  "purpose": "This script is used for setting up and configuring the 'torcheval' Python package, including handling requirements, versioning, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading requirements files ('requirements.txt', 'dev-requirements.txt', 'image-requirements.txt'), reading 'README.md', command-line arguments parsing.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup()' function call that uses the collected metadata and requirements to build the package.",
  "flows": "Input from files and command-line arguments flows into variables used for package configuration, which then flow into the 'setup()' function for package creation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The script performs standard setup tasks, and no network connections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script correctly reads package metadata and requirements, handles versioning, and configures package build parameters. No malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behavior is detected. The code follows standard setup.py conventions, and all data handling appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a project. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe for use and does not pose security risks.",
