  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'torcheval' library, handling versioning, requirements, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads requirements files, README.md, command-line arguments, and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Calls setuptools.setup() with collected parameters; no untrusted data execution or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input files and command-line args flow into variables used in setup(), culminating in the setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with standard practices: reading requirements, handling nightly versioning, and invoking setuptools.setup(). It does not perform any network operations, code injection, or contain obfuscated/malicious code. The logic is straightforward, and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe for supply chain use.",
