{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for the 'torcheval' Python package, enabling package installation, versioning, and dependency management.",
  "sources": "Reads from files: 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', 'dev-requirements.txt', 'image-requirements.txt'. User can pass command-line arguments to modify build behavior.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data or perform harmful actions. The script mainly reads files and configures package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line args) influences package name and version; file reads provide package metadata and dependencies; no data flows leading to security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated patterns, or hardcoded secrets. The code correctly uses safe standard libraries and methods for setup. No indications of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup script. It reads package information from files, processes command-line arguments to determine build type, and calls setuptools.setup() to package the library. There are no dynamic code executions, network connections, or malicious code segments. It relies on external files for dependencies and description. All operations are typical for Python package configuration and appear safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or malware. It functions as intended for package installation and versioning without any security concerns.",
