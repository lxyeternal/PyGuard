{
  "purpose": "Define custom metric classes for PyTorch models, including summing metrics and managing state in various data structures.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (collections, typing, torch, torcheval.metrics), class initializers, update methods, compute methods, merge_state methods.",
  "targets": "Potential untrusted data inputs include tensors passed to update methods, but no direct source of untrusted input appears in the code.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are added to internal state; states are merged across metrics; no external data or network calls are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors. The code is straightforward, with standard tensor operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Metric subclasses for summing tensors and maintaining state in various forms (single tensor, list, dictionary). It uses torch.inference_mode() for efficiency and proper tensor management. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, file access, or secret leaks. All data flows are contained within the class states, and external inputs are limited to tensors passed via update methods. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be standard, purpose-specific metric implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of well-structured metric classes for internal use in PyTorch models, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard tensor summation and state merging. No malicious intent or security threats detected.",
