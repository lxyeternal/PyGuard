  "purpose": "Distributed metric synchronization, cloning, resetting, and device management utilities for PyTorch metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads metric states, process group info, tensor device info, and state dicts.",
  "sinks": "No external data transfer; internal state sharing and synchronization across processes.",
  "flows": "Source: metric state dicts and device info -> sync_states function -> merged state dicts -> metrics or pseudo-metrics.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic object creation (`_convert_to_psuedo_metric`) for internal state handling; warnings about NCCL and CPU tensors are standard in distributed training.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard distributed synchronization, cloning, and device transfer functions. No external network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The internal utility `_convert_to_psuedo_metric` is benign, serving as a lightweight object wrapper for state dicts. Warnings about tensor device placement are typical. The functions are well-documented and align with common distributed training patterns. No malicious code, sabotage, or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard utility for managing distributed metrics in PyTorch. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware score (0), obfuscated score (0), and minimal risk score (~0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's purpose.",
