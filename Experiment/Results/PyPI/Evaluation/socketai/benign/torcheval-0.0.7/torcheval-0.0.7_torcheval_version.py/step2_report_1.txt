  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Actual Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code only assigns a static version string to the `__version__` variable.\n   - There are no dynamic elements, external inputs, network calls, or code execution.\n   - The code is straightforward, minimal, and well-documented.\n   - **Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no malicious or security-risk behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is a simple version string declaration with no suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely declarative with no dynamic or external data handling, a high risk score is unwarranted.\n   - The current scores of 0 or 0.1 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - No malicious activity is present.\n   - The malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a standard version declaration.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless version string declaration.\n- No malicious or obfuscated elements are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and thorough. Given the simplicity and benign nature of the code, no changes to the scores or conclusions are necessary.",
