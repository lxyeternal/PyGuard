  "purpose": "Define the package version as a static string following PEP-0440 standards.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string \"0.0.7\" to the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted input/output involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without external data or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward version string declaration with proper comments and licensing.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a fixed version string to __version__, with no dynamic elements, external inputs, or code execution. It adheres to standard practices for defining package versioning. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code is minimal, well-documented, and does not interact with external data or systems. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version string declaration with no malicious or security-risk behavior. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring is consistent with the code's simplicity. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
