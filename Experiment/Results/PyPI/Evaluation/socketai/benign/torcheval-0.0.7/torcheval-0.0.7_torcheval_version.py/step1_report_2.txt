  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple declaration of a version string following PEP-0440 conventions. There are no user inputs, environment variables, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated or suspicious patterns are present. The comments clarify versioning schemes, but they do not introduce security issues. The license header and version string are typical for open-source packages. Overall, the code appears benign and standard for package versioning.",
