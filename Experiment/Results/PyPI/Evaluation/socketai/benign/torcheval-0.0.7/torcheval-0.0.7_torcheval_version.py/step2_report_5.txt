  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issue presence:** The code is just a static assignment of a version string. No dynamic code, input, or external data.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same as above, static version string.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same static assignment.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same static assignment.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issue presence:** Same static assignment.\n   - **Errors/flaws:** None.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n   - **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that this code is a straightforward, benign version declaration.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is present or implied.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n- Obfuscation is not present, so 0 is correct.\n- The overall security risk is negligible.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent across all reports.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The code is entirely benign.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is a standard version string declaration with no security concerns.",
