  "sources": "The __version__ variable assignment",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow leading to external effects",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; only a version string assignment",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a version string to the __version__ variable. It contains comments about licensing and version scheme guidelines. There are no inputs, external data reads, or untrusted data flows. No functions or code that interact with external systems, network, or sensitive data are present. The code appears standard and minimal, consistent with a package version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks identified.",
