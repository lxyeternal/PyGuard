{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to generate synthetic datasets (binary, multiclass, multilabel, binned binary) for machine learning testing, using standard PyTorch random functions.",
  "sources": "Functions read input parameters to determine tensor shapes and generate random tensors via torch.rand and torch.randint.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources, network connections, or file I/O; data is generated internally and returned as tensors.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence tensor shapes; random data is generated and returned directly, with no external data flow or external system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; threshold creation in get_rand_data_binned_binary is standard for binning and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions for synthetic data generation, employing standard PyTorch functions. No external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The shape logic is correct, and no hardcoded secrets or malicious code are detected. The functions are well-documented and serve testing purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for synthetic data generation in testing environments. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is 0, security risk score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and confidence is high (1).",
