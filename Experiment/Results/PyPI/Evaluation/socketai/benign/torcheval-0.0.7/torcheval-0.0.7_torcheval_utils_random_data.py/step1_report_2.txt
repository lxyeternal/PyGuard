{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to generate random datasets for machine learning tasks, including binary, multiclass, multilabel, and binned binary datasets, for use in model training or evaluation.",
  "sources": "Input data is generated internally using torch.rand and torch.randint functions; no external input sources are read from outside the code.",
  "sinks": "Generated tensors are returned to the caller; no external data is sent over networks or stored maliciously. No data leaks or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal random tensor generation to return statements; no external sinks or external data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns detected. All functions generate synthetic data; there are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of functions to produce random tensors for various dataset types, using standard PyTorch functions. No external data inputs are read, and no data is sent externally. The functions handle tensor shape adjustments based on input parameters and return tensors on the specified device. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code constructs are evident. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of generating synthetic data for testing or training machine learning models.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for generating synthetic datasets. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe to use.",
