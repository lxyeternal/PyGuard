{
  "purpose": "A minimal module that imports a version string from a local module and exposes it via __all__, serving as package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .version module, reading the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Import of __version__ from local module to module attribute exposure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple __init__.py or setup module that imports a version string and exposes it. It contains only licensing comments, import statements, and attribute definitions. No data input/output, network activity, or code execution occurs. The code structure is standard for package metadata. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and justified. Confidence is high (1) due to the code's simplicity and clarity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard package metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
