  "purpose": "Define module version and metadata for a PyTorch model metrics library.",
  "sources": "Importing __version__ from a local version module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external outputs or network operations.",
  "flows": "Import source (__version__) used internally; no external data flow or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Simple import and module attribute definition; no anomalies or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up version information and exports it for a library. It contains a standard license header, imports a version string, and defines __all__ for module exports. There are no input, output, or execution paths that involve untrusted data or malicious activity. The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and free from obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, benign module setup for a Python library with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
