  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the accuracy of their assessments, scores, and underlying assumptions.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code snippets are minimal, standard __init__.py files that import a version string and expose it via __all__.\n- There are no signs of untrusted data input, external network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n- The code is straightforward, well-structured, and typical for package metadata setup.\n- All reports agree on benignity, with confidence scores of 1 and malware/security risk scores of 0.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code matches the original provided. No discrepancies.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No evident vulnerabilities; the code is static and non-executable beyond imports and attribute definitions.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Are there any errors or flaws?**  \n  No. The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign, standard package metadata setup.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. Malware and security risk scores are 0, reflecting the benign nature. Confidence scores are 1, indicating certainty.\n\n- **Are any claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports base their conclusions on straightforward code analysis, not assumptions.\n\n- **Is there any inconsistency?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the straightforward, non-malicious nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a simple, standard __init__.py file for exposing version info, with no malicious or security concerns.",
