  "purpose": "Define and expose the version information of the library.",
  "sources": "Importing __version__ from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "Import of __version__ -> inclusion in __all__ list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and typical for a package __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module, which is common for package metadata. It then declares __all__ to expose __version__. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal and appears to serve purely informational purposes. No external data handling, network communication, or dynamic execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package initialization file with no malicious behavior. It simply exposes version information for the library, and there are no security concerns.",
