  "purpose": "Defines metadata for a Python library related to PyTorch model metrics.",
  "sources": "Imports __version__ from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; no data processing flows evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments, import statements, and __all__ declaration. It imports version information from a local module and exposes it. No input/output operations, external network activity, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is minimal and appears to serve as part of a larger package, focusing on package metadata. No signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign, serving as package metadata with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
