  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe identical or very similar code snippets: importing a `__version__` from a local module and exposing it via `__all__`.\n- The code is minimal, standard for Python package `__init__.py` files, with no dynamic execution, external network activity, or data processing.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature described.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Detailed analysis:**\n\n1. **Code presence and correctness:**\n   - The code is present as described.\n   - It correctly imports `__version__` and exposes it, a common pattern.\n   - No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident.\n\n2. **Logic and reasoning:**\n   - The logic is straightforward: set up version info for a package.\n   - No suspicious assumptions or flawed reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - All reports assign malware = 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated = 0, as expected.\n   - Security risk = 0, consistent with the benign code.\n   - The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n\n4. **Risk justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely for package metadata, the risk is minimal.\n   - No external data handling, no code execution, no network activity.\n   - The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n5. **Claims about vulnerabilities:**\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made, only descriptions of benign code.\n   - No assumptions are made that could be challenged.\n\n6. **Consistency:**\n   - The scores align with the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\nGiven the uniformity and simplicity, I concur with the provided scores.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard, benign package metadata setup.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code poses no security concern, and the scoring reflects that.",
