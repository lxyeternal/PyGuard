{
  "purpose": "Define package version information and export version symbol for a PyTorch metrics library.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .version module, list assignment for __all__",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks, no output or external communication",
  "flows": "Import flows into module namespace; no data flows to external systems",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code structures, no obfuscated code, only standard version import and export",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a version string from a local module and sets the __all__ attribute to expose __version__. No data input/output, network activity, or code execution is present. The code is minimal and straightforward, typical for Python package __init__.py files. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package metadata setup with no malicious or security risk indications. It performs simple import and export of version info, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
