  "purpose": "Defines package version information for a PyTorch metrics library.",
  "sources": "Imports __version__ from a local module; sets __all__ with __version__.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Imports version data from local module; exposes it publicly via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and does not contain suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version identifier from a local module and exposes it via __all__, typical for Python package metadata files. There are no dynamic code executions, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The code structure is simple and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for package versioning, and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
