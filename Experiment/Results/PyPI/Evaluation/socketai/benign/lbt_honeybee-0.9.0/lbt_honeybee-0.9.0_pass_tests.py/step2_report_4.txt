  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code snippet is solely a comment with no executable statements, data reads, or data flows.\n   - No suspicious or malicious constructs are present; the code does not interact with any data or external systems.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the snippet is just a comment and poses no security threat.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a comment with no executable or malicious content, risk scores should remain at 0.\n   - Any higher score would imply potential security issues, which are not supported by the evidence.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports.\n   - No malicious activity or code is present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they explicitly state the absence of executable code or suspicious behavior.\n   - They correctly interpret the comment as benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the content of the code snippets.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe snippet is harmless—a comment with no executable code or security implications. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and should remain at zero.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Final Score |\n|--------------------|--------------|\n| Malware            | 0            |\n| Obfuscated         | 0            |\n| Security Risk      | 0            |\n\nNo further action needed.",
