  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for installing dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files.",
  "sinks": "None; static data read into variables, passed to setup().",
  "flows": "File reads -> variables -> setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static file reading and setup invocation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup process: it reads static files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') and passes their contents to setuptools.setup() without executing or manipulating untrusted data. No dynamic code execution, network activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code adheres to standard packaging practices and contains no hardcoded secrets or malicious code. External files are read in a controlled manner, and the script does not process or evaluate their contents beyond reading them as strings. Given these observations, there is no indication of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. All signals point to a safe and conventional implementation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
