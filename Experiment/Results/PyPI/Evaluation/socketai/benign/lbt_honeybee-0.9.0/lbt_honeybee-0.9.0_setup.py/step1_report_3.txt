{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package named 'lbt-honeybee'. It installs package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data; no data output or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Reads local files (README.md, requirements.txt) to gather package information and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading static files for description and dependencies, configuring package metadata, and calling setuptools.setup(). No untrusted data is processed beyond reading static files; dependencies are specified via requirements.txt. There are no obfuscated elements, code injections, or suspicious logic. The code adheres to common setup patterns, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It simply reads static files and configures package metadata. Overall, it poses no security risks.",
