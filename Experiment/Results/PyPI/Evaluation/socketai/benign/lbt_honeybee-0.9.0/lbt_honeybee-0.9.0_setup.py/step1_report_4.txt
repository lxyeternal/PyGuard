  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package called 'lbt-honeybee' by reading metadata and requirements files and configuring the package installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long_description and 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows into sinks such as network, file, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Reads data from files and passes them into setup configuration; no untrusted data flow to potentially dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected. Uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup activities: reading description and requirements files, and calling setuptools.setup() with appropriate arguments. All file reads are from local, controlled files. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or network activity is present. There are no hardcoded credentials or other security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply configures package installation parameters based on local files.",
