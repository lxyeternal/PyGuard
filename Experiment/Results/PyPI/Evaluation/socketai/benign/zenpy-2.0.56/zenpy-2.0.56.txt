The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified by its purpose and proper handling of credentials. The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and integrity."

The main concern is the external callback mechanism, which could be exploited if callbacks are malicious, but this is outside the code's scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.2), primarily due to reliance on external functions."
