  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for change detection in data structures. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities exists. The main concern is the external callback mechanism, which could be exploited if callbacks are malicious, but this is outside the code's scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk is minimal (~0.2), primarily due to reliance on external functions."
