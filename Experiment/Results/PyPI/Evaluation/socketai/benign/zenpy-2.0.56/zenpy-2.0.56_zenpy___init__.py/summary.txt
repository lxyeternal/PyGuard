  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure, and well-implemented Zendesk API wrapper. It contains no malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.1-0.2) is justified by its purpose and proper handling of credentials. The malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and integrity."
