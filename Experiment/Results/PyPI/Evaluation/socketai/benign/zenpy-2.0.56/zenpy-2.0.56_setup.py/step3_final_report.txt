  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for packaging the 'zenpy' library with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static package metadata fields; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no network or file operations beyond static configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Minor configuration issue: 'license_files' should be a list ['LICENSE'] instead of a string 'LICENSE'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script using setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads a README file for description and specifies dependencies explicitly. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The only anomaly is the 'license_files' parameter being a string rather than a list, which is a benign configuration mistake. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious intent or security issues. The minor configuration mistake does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, with malware, obfuscation, and risk scores set to 0. The overall assessment confirms the package is safe for use.",
