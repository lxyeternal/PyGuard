  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'zenpy' Python package, a wrapper for the Zendesk API.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing setup and setuptools modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no network or data leakage code present.",
  "flows": "Reading file content to assign to 'long_description'; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present. License files specified as a string, which is typical and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads the README.md file for package description, and calls setup() with package metadata. The data flow is straightforward, primarily involving static strings and file reading. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious behavior is detected. All dependencies and metadata appear standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It safely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
