{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'zenpy' Python package, a wrapper for the Zendesk API, including package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description, importing setuptools and pathlib for setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; the code mainly deals with package metadata and dependency specifications.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code does not process untrusted data or user input; it defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures observed. License files are referenced but not explicitly specified, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical package setup using setuptools, including reading a markdown file for the description. No user input, network connections, or executable code is present. The dependencies are standard and explicitly listed. The license is specified, and no suspicious behaviors or obfuscated code are evident. All code functions are typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It primarily manages package metadata and dependencies.",
