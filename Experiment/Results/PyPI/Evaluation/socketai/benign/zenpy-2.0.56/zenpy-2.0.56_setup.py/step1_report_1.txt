  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'zenpy' Python package, a wrapper for the Zendesk API.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; importing modules; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "None present; the script only defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic code execution or data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: importing modules, reading a local README file, and calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All code appears conventional and aligns with common Python packaging practices. No indications of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The dependencies listed are typical for such a package. No external or untrusted inputs are used in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only manages package metadata and dependencies, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
