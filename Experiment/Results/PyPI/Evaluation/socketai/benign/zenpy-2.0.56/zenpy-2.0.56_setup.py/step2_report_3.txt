  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports conclude that the code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code snippets provided are identical or very similar, performing typical package configuration tasks.\n- No untrusted input sources, dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- Minor issues such as the 'license_files' parameter being a string instead of a list are noted but are benign and do not impact security.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Issues present in code?**  \n  No. All reports agree that the code is standard and benign.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  Minor: The 'license_files' parameter should be a list, e.g., `license_files=['LICENSE']`, but this is a configuration detail, not a security flaw.\n\n- **Scores given:**  \n  All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 1 with confidence 1, indicating no suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  Since the code is a typical setup script with no malicious activity, a malware score of **0** is appropriate. The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  The code is straightforward and not obfuscated. An obfuscated score of **0** is justified.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Given the absence of any malicious or suspicious behavior, a risk score of **0** is suitable.\n\n- **Potential assumptions or claims:**  \n  All reports avoid making assumptions about vulnerabilities; they simply state the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The minor configuration issue with 'license_files' should be corrected for correctness but does not influence security.\n- No further action is necessary; the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n### My overall assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical, benign package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
