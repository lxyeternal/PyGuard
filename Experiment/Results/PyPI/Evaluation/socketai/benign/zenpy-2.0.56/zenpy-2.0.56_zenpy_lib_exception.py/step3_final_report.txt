{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for internal errors, API errors, rate limiting, cache issues, and record handling within a Python library or application.",
  "sources": "Class initializations and inheritance; no external data sources or input handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external interactions; purely class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception classes are used for error handling but do not process data.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with descriptive docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception base classes. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The classes serve as structured error handling mechanisms. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is standard and benign, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in a Python project. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
