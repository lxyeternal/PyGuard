  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in the Zenpy API client.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read; the code defines exception classes only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow between sources and sinks; only class definitions and initializations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions, inheriting from built-in exceptions or other custom exceptions. It includes no data input/output, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage are detected. All classes serve to handle specific error cases within a larger API client implementation. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for an API client. It poses no security risk or malicious intent.",
