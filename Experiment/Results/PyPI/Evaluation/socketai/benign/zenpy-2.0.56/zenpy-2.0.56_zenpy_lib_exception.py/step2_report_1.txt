  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the potential security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Defines custom exception classes for internal error handling.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data, no data processing.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: The code is straightforward class definitions inheriting from Python exceptions, with no suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe, standard exception definitions.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Custom exceptions for error handling.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No data processing or external interactions.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Same as above, purely class definitions.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes for API client errors.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No data handling or external calls.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard exception classes, no suspicious code.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes for error handling.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No data processing.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard class definitions.\n- Conclusion: No security concerns.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes for API error handling.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No data or external interactions.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Purely structural, no suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Safe.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence:** The code is only class definitions for exceptions, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0 across all reports; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Final Justification:\nThe code is a standard, well-structured set of exception class definitions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks. The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the content.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nNo changes needed. The code is safe, and the report's assessments are accurate.",
