{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors within the Zenpy library or application.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; exception raising is standard and safe.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; exceptions are used for control flow and error handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward class definitions for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to API errors, rate limits, cache issues, and internal errors. Each class inherits from standard Python exception classes, with no dynamic execution, no input reading, and no suspicious behavior. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs. It serves as an error handling module, which is typical and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions for error handling in a Python library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears safe and intended solely for structured exception management.",
