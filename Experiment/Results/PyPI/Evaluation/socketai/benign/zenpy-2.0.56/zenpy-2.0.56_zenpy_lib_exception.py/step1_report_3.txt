{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Zenpy API client.",
  "sources": "None (no data input sources); exceptions are instantiated during runtime errors.",
  "sinks": "None; exception classes do not perform malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "flows": "None; code only defines classes and does not process data or perform operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions in a Zenpy API client. The classes inherit from built-in exceptions and do not contain any data processing, network calls, or security-sensitive operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. The structure is straightforward and typical for exception handling modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions for a Python API client. No malicious activity, supply chain risks, or security concerns are evident.",
