  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully, step-by-step.\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**  \nThe code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to a Zenpy library or API client. There are no functions, data processing, external data sources, or network operations. The classes inherit from standard Python exceptions and contain descriptive docstrings. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is straightforward, safe, and serves purely as an error handling module. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n**3. Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \nAll reports assign:\n- malware: 0\n- obfuscated: 0\n- securityRisk: 0\n\nThese are appropriate given the nature of the code. Since the code is only defining exception classes, these scores are reasonable.\n\n**4. Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \nNo report assigns a risk score above 0.5. All are 0, which is justified because the code does not perform any operations that could pose security risks, contain malicious payloads, or be obfuscated.\n\n**5. Malware Score Consideration:**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis that the code is purely structural exception class definitions with no malicious intent.\n\n**6. Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \nAll reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as standard exception class definitions with no malicious or security-related issues.\n\n**7. Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**  \nThe scores are consistent and appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in a Python library. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive elements. The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and contains no security risks. The provided reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No further action or adjustment is needed.",
