  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the associated code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to a Python library or application.\n   - There are no data flows, external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code is standard for error handling modules, with clear inheritance and descriptive docstrings.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The analysis correctly concludes that the code poses no security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior, higher risk scores are unjustified.\n   - The current scores are reasonable and align with the code's benign nature.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they base their conclusions on code structure and content.\n   - They correctly identify the code as non-malicious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the code content.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall Justification:**\nThe code is a straightforward, standard set of exception class definitions used for error handling in a Python API client. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The reports' evaluations are accurate and appropriate.\n\n**My Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign and standard nature of the code.",
