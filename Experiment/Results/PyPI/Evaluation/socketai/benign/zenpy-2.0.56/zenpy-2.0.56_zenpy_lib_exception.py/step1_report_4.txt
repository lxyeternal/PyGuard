  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a Zenpy API client library to handle various internal and API-related errors.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; no data reading or external input handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears standard for exception class definitions with proper inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions related to the Zenpy API client. Each class extends from built-in or custom exceptions, providing descriptive docstrings. There are no input processing, data handling, network operations, or security-sensitive functions present. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected. The structure is typical for error handling in Python modules. No suspicious or malicious behavior is identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions intended for error handling within a Zenpy API client. It contains no malicious code, no external data input, and no security risks. It appears to be safe and standard.",
