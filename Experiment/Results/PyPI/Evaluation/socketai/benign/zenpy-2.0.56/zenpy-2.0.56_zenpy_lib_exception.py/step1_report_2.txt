  "sources": "No external input or data reading; the code only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is purely class definitions without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with appropriate inheritance and docstrings. There are no functions, data processing, or external calls. No suspicious or malicious code elements are present. The code appears to be standard, well-structured exception handling code for a Python application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
