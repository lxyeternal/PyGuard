  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code defines several custom exception classes, all inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception` or `ZenpyException`.\n   - Each class has a descriptive docstring.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n2. **Security Implications:**\n   - The code is purely structural, serving as an error handling module.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.\n   - The exception classes are standard practice in Python projects for managing specific error cases.\n\n3. **Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious or suspicious code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with straightforward class definitions.\n\n4. **Risk Scores:**\n   - All reports assign a security risk of 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - The overall risk is minimal; the code is standard exception handling.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Misinterpretations:**\n   - No issues are present in the code.\n   - The reports correctly identify the code as safe, with no anomalies or security concerns.\n   - The reasoning is sound; exception class definitions are benign.\n\n6. **Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are reasonable.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a typical, safe exception handling module.\n- The scores reflect the actual content accurately.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, straightforward, and contains no security concerns.",
