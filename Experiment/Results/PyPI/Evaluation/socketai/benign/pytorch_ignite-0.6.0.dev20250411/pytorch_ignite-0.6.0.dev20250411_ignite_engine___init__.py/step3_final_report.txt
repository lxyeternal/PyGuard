  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for supervised training and evaluation supporting multiple hardware backends and mixed precision modes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'batch' via prepare_batch; user-defined functions for batch processing and output transformation.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks if user functions leak sensitive info; no external network or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Standard ML data flow from batch input through model, with optional transformations and loss computation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of training/evaluation routines with multi-platform support. No malicious behaviors or obfuscation are present. The use of user-defined functions introduces potential misuse but is typical in ML frameworks. No external network activity or secret handling is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, legitimate ML utility code supporting multiple hardware and mixed precision modes. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on user implementation, with malware and obfuscated scores set to 0. The risk score is approximately 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting potential misuse but no inherent vulnerabilities.",
