  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code only imports modules and sets a version string; no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, security risk is 0.1, which seems reasonable given the development version string.\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score reflects the development status, but since no malicious activity is present, this seems appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Correct assessment.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above, purely import statements.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity; development version string is standard.\n- **Overall:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Only import statements and a version string.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0, which is consistent.\n- **Justification:** The development version string is noted but does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same pattern—imports and version string.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0.1, which is acceptable due to the dev version.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Overall:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Only imports and version string.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are 0; security risk is 0, matching the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** The inclusion of 'ignite.contrib' is standard for extended features, not suspicious.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0 for some reports due to the development version string, which might imply less stability but not necessarily risk.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** Around 0.1 to 0.2 — minor concern due to the dev version string, but not a security threat.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and reasonable. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.",
