  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source ML engine framework with no malicious or sabotage intent. It is transparent, free of obfuscation, and does not contain malicious code. The slight security risk score reflects the potential for user-defined handlers to execute arbitrary code, but this is a known and accepted aspect of such frameworks. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
