{
  "purpose": "The code defines a machine learning training engine that manages dataset iteration, event handling, and training lifecycle control, supporting features like resume, terminate, and custom event registration.",
  "sources": "Input data provided via set_data() method, process_function passed during initialization, and external event triggers such as interrupts and termination signals.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or data exfiltration points are present. No network communication, file writing, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data is read from DataLoader or iterable, processed via process_function, with control flow managed through event handlers and exception handling for termination or interruption signals.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspiciously obfuscated code. Use of exception classes for termination control is standard. No unusual dynamic code execution, malicious API usage, or privacy violations detected. Logging is standard, and third-party imports are legitimate for ML workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive engine for managing ML training workflows, including event registration, interruption, termination, and state management. All components serve clear, legitimate purposes consistent with typical training loop control. The code handles exceptions to manage early stopping and resumption, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The absence of network calls, credential handling, or data leaks indicates a benign implementation. The design aligns with well-established ML engine patterns, and no signals of malware or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate training engine for ML workflows with robust control features. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are detected. Its structure and imports are consistent with typical frameworks, and no suspicious or obfuscated code segments are present.",
