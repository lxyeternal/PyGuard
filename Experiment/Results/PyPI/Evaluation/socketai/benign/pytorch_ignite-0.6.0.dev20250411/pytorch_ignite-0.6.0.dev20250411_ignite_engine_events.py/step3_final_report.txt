{
  "purpose": "Defines event handling, filtering, and state management classes for the Ignite framework, facilitating event-driven execution control.",
  "sources": "Internal class methods, attributes, and user-defined filters; no external data sources or untrusted input handling.",
  "sinks": "No network, file I/O, or external data exfiltration points; data flows are internal within the framework.",
  "flows": "Method calls and data passing within classes; no external sinks or malicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard event handling and state management classes, with typical use of weak references, input validation, and enums. No external data sources or malicious constructs are present. Signature validation via _check_signature is a utility for safety, not a malicious sink. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The code aligns with common framework components, and the security implications are minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard component of the Ignite ML framework, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the risk score is appropriately low (~0.1) due to potential misuse of user-defined filters, but no actual threat exists.",
