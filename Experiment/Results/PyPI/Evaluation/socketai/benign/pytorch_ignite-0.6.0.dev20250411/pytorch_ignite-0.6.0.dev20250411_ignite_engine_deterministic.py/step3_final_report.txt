  "purpose": "Utilities for reproducible data loading, seed management, and deterministic engine control in PyTorch ML workflows.",
  "sources": "Reading RNG states, batch sampler attributes, environment variables, and internal data loader attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks, network activity, or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "RNG state and seed values are saved and restored; batch sampler indices flow from setup to iteration; RNG states flow between functions for reproducibility.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected. RNG state manipulations are standard for reproducibility.",
  "analysis": "The code manages RNG states across random, numpy, and torch; replaces batch samplers with reproducible versions; controls torch backend settings for determinism; and restores RNG states if resuming. No network calls, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The purpose aligns with standard ML reproducibility practices. No anomalies or suspicious code segments are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for ensuring deterministic behavior in PyTorch training workflows. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code. The minor security risk associated with RNG state management is justified by its purpose and is a common practice. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its intended use.",
