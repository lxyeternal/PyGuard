{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for checking function signatures and converting elapsed time in seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds.",
  "sources": "The code reads function objects and their arguments; it also reads the input parameter 'time_taken'.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a ValueError with detailed messages but does not execute any untrusted code or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are checked against function signatures, and time data is processed for conversion; errors in signature validation are raised with messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The functions utilize standard Python modules (inspect, typing) for signature validation and time conversion. Signature validation is a typical use-case with proper exception handling. Time conversion uses divmod and rounding without unsafe operations. There are no external data transmissions, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated code. The code appears to be utility functions intended for validation and formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as utility functions for signature checking and time formatting, and does not contain malware or security risks.",
