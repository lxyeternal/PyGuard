  "purpose": "Utility functions for inspecting function signatures and converting time durations.",
  "sources": "inspect.signature() for examining function parameters, no external data sources or user input handling.",
  "sinks": "None that process untrusted input or could leak data; no network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "No flow from sources to sinks, as the code primarily performs internal inspection and calculation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; functions are straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two utility functions. '_check_signature' verifies that function parameters match provided arguments, using Python's inspect module, and raises an error if mismatched. '_to_hours_mins_secs' converts seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds. Both functions are standard, safe, and do not perform any network, file, or environment operations. No malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks are detected. The code appears to be for internal validation and utility purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is safe and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It performs standard utility operations related to function signature validation and time conversion without any security risks.",
