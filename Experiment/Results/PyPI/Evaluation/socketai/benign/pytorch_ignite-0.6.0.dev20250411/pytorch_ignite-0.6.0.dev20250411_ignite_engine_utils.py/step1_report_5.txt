  "purpose": "Utility functions for checking function signatures and converting time durations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters from function calls and data passed to the functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present. The code does not perform any network operations, file access, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are used in signature validation and time conversion calculations, with no external data flow or untrusted data usage beyond function parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code appears to be straightforward utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform standard operations: inspecting function signatures and converting seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or privacy violations. No external network, file, or environment interactions are present. The code uses standard library features without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be standard, well-structured helper code for validation and time conversion.",
