{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for function signature validation and time conversion.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters from the function call (_check_signature) and the variable 'time_taken' for conversion (_to_hours_mins_secs).",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data externally, nor does it perform any operations that would leak data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are used for signature validation and time conversion; no external data flow is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. The code is straightforward utility logic.",
  "analysis": "The functions utilize standard Python modules (inspect) for signature validation and simple arithmetic for time conversion. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious payloads are evident. The code operates solely on provided input parameters, with no side effects or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard validation and conversion tasks without external dependencies or dangerous behaviors.",
