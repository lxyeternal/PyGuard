{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for inspecting function signatures and converting time durations, likely used for debugging, validation, or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments (*args, **kwargs) and the 'time_taken' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The code performs no untrusted data output, external system calls, or data leaks; it only raises exceptions locally and returns simple data types.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are used for signature validation and time conversion; no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code inspects function signatures to verify argument correctness, catching TypeErrors and raising informative ValueErrors. The second function converts seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds, with proper rounding. No external calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated elements are present. The logic is standard utility code for debugging or validation tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include any network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious logic. It solely performs internal validation and simple calculations.",
