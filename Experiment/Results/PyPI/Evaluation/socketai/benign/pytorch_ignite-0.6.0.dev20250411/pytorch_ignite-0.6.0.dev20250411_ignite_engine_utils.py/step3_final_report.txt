  "purpose": "Utility functions for signature validation and time conversion.",
  "sources": "Uses inspect.signature to analyze function signatures; no external data input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks, external communication, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into signature binding; time value flows into conversion calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation, no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two utility functions: one for checking function signatures using inspect.signature and binding, with proper error handling; another for converting seconds into hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds using divmod and rounding. Both functions use standard Python modules and arithmetic, with no external data flow, network activity, or side effects. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The signature check function validates parameters and raises informative errors on mismatch. The time conversion function performs accurate calculations. All reports assign malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard utility functions with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
