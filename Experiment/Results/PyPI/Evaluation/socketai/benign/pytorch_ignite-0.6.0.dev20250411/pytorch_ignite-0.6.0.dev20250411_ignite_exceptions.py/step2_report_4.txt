  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the claims with the original code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The original code is a minimal, straightforward Python module defining a list `__all__` and a custom exception class `NotComputableError` inheriting from `RuntimeError`. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external interactions. The code appears benign and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition with no suspicious constructs. They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. There are no logical errors or misconceptions in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a `malware` score of 0 and a `securityRisk` of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature. The `obfuscated` score is also 0, which is correct. The `confidence` scores are all 1, reflecting certainty about the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely defining a custom exception class with no external interactions, the risk scores are appropriately low. No reason exists to assign higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is accurate. The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a benign, standard pattern for defining custom exceptions.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** — No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n- **Risk Score**: **0** — No security risk, given the benign nature.\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThe code is a straightforward, standard Python pattern for defining a custom exception class. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The scores assigned by all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware**: **0**  \n- **Obfuscated**: **0**  \n- **Risk**: **0**  \n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the actual code.",
