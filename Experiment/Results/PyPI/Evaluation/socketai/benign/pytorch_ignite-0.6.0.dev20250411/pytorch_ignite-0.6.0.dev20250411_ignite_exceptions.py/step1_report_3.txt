  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for signaling that a metric cannot be computed.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading occurs in this code).",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data handling or external data output).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow paths involving untrusted data).",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no unusual patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list __all__ for module exports containing a single string 'NotComputableError'. It also defines a class NotComputableError that inherits from RuntimeError, serving as a custom exception. The implementation is simple, standard, and contains no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. No malicious behavior or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign definition of a custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks.",
