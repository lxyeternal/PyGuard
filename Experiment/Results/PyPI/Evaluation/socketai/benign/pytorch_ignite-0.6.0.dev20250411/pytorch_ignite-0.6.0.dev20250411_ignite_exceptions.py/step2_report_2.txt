  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the underlying code:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines a list `__all__` with a single string `'NotComputableError'`.\n   - It defines a class `NotComputableError` inheriting from `RuntimeError` with a docstring.\n   - There are no input/output operations, no data processing, no dynamic code, no external dependencies, and no obfuscation.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and straightforward.\n\n2. **Analysis of Report Validity:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign, standard custom exception class.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious constructs, or malicious patterns are present.\n   - The reasoning in each report aligns with the code's simplicity and clarity.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Justification:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated: 0` — correct, no obfuscation.\n     - `malware: 0` — correct, no malicious behavior.\n     - `securityRisk: 0` — correct, no security issues.\n     - `confidence: 1` — justified, the analysis is thorough and accurate.\n   - The uniformity across reports is appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n4. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n   - No report suggests any hidden or malicious intent.\n   - The code does not include any assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities; it merely defines an exception class.\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment and My Recommendations:**\n   - The malware score should remain at **0**, as there is no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score should remain at **0**, as the code is clear.\n   - The risk score should be **0**, given the benign nature.\n   - The confidence score of **1** is justified.\n   - No changes are necessary to the scores.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n- The code is a straightforward, safe, and standard Python exception class definition.\n- All reports correctly identify this.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- There are no indications of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
