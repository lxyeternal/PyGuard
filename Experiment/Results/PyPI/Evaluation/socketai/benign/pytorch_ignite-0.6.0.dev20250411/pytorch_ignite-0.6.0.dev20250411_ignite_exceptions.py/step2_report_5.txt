  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, standard Python class defining a custom exception (`NotComputableError`) with an associated `__all__` list.\n   - No issues, bugs, or vulnerabilities are identified or implied.\n   - The code is minimal, with no external dependencies, data flows, or complex logic.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or inaccuracies are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - No issue warrants a risk score above 0.5 because:\n     - The code is purely definitional, with no external interactions.\n     - No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n     - The purpose is to define a custom exception, a common pattern.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - Since the code contains no dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions or potential vulnerabilities:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made or need to be challenged.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\nGiven the uniformity and correctness of the reports, I concur with their assessments. The code is a standard, safe exception class definition with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Score |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| Malware        | 0            |\n| Obfuscated     | 0            |\n| Security Risk  | 0            |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports are accurate and thorough.",
