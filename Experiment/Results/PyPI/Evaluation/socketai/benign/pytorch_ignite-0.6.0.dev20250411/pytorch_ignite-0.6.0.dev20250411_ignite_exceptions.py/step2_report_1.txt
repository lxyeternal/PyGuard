  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward, standard Python exception class definition with no input/output, data processing, or external interactions. There are no issues or anomalies in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, as there's no obfuscation.  \n   - **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, as there's no malicious activity or intent.  \n   - **Security Risk Score (0)**: Correct, given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.  \n   - **Confidence (1)**: Fully justified, given the consistent, straightforward analysis.  \n   \n   All scores seem appropriate and reasonable based on the code and reports.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code is benign and contains no suspicious features, there is no justification for increasing the malware or security risk scores.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's behavior.\n\n6. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (No malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (Code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (No security risk associated with this code)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a minimal, standard Python exception class definition with no external dependencies, no data handling, and no suspicious features. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is safe, benign, and typical for defining custom exceptions in Python. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.",
