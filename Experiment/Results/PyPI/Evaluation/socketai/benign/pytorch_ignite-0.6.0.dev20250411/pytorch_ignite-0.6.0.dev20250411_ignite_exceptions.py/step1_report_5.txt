{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for indicating when a metric cannot be computed.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sink points where untrusted data could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways identified; the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a list '__all__' specifying exported symbols, containing a single string 'NotComputableError'. It then defines a class 'NotComputableError' that inherits from RuntimeError, with a simple docstring. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no use of external or sensitive resources. The code is straightforward, standard, and appears to be a benign exception class definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard definition of a custom exception class with no malicious or security risks. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or contain any suspicious patterns. Overall, it is safe and contains no security concerns.",
