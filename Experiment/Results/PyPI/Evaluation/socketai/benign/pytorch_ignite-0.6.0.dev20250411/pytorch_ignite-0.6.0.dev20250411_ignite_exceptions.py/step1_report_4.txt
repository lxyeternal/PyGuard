  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling errors related to non-computable metrics.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list __all__ for exporting the NotComputableError class, which is a subclass of RuntimeError. The class has a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a typical, benign definition of a custom exception used for clarity in error handling within larger projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard exception class definition with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
