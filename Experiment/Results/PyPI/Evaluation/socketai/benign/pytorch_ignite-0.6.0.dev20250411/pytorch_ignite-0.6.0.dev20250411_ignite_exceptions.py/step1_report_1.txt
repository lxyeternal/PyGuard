  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for signaling an uncomputable metric error.",
  "sources": "None (no data input sources present).",
  "sinks": "None (no data outputs, external interactions, or untrusted data handling).",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified as there are no input/output operations or data manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and contains no unusual or suspicious constructs; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a list __all__ with a single string 'NotComputableError' to specify exports. It then defines a RuntimeError subclass named NotComputableError with a docstring. The implementation is minimal, standard, and lacks any suspicious features or behavior. No external data handling, no code execution, and no malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a simple, benign custom exception class definition with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be a standard, safe component of a larger codebase.",
