  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for signaling that a metric cannot be computed.",
  "sources": "The module's own code defining the list __all__ and the class NotComputableError.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard Python exception class definition with no unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a list __all__ containing a string 'NotComputableError' and a class definition for NotComputableError inheriting from RuntimeError. The class includes a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The code appears to be straightforward and typical for defining custom exceptions in Python, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python exception class definition with no malicious intent or suspicious features. It simply declares an exception for use in other modules.",
