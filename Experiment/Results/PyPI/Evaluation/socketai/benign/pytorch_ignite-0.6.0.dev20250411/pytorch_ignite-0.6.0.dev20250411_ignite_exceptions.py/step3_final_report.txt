  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class NotComputableError for signaling uncomputable metrics.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definition and list declaration.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external outputs or data leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class definition with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, standard Python class with no suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python exception class with an associated __all__ list. It contains no input/output, data processing, external dependencies, obfuscation, or malicious code. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and clarity support these assessments. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The scores are consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python exception class with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
