  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward, standard Python exception class definition with no suspicious or malicious features. The code simply declares a list `__all__` and a class `NotComputableError` inheriting from `RuntimeError`, with a docstring. No external data, dynamic code, or obfuscation is present.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no anomalies or security issues. There are no logical errors or flawed reasoning observed.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - `malware`: 0\n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports indicate no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risk, the overall risk score should be 0. The code is a simple exception class, standard in many codebases.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All assessments are based on direct analysis of the code, with no assumptions about hidden behaviors. The code is explicit and transparent.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0  \n\nThis code is a benign, standard exception class with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Note:** No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malware is present. The code is safe and standard.",
