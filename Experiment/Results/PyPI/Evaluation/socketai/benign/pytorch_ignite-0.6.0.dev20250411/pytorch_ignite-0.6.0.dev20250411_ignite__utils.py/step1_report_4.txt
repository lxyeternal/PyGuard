  "purpose": "Re-export utility functions from the ignite.utils module for use in other parts of the application.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions from 'ignite.utils'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; this is purely a module re-export.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward and uses standard import/export syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific functions from the ignite.utils module and defines __all__ for module exports. There are no input data handling, no processing, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. This is a standard pattern for re-exporting functions in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign re-export of utility functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
