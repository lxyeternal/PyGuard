  "anomalies": "None",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from ignite.utils and defines __all__ for module exports. It contains no data processing, input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The code is a straightforward module setup typical in Python projects, especially in machine learning contexts. Given the simplicity and benign nature, there are no security risks or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard module re-export with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores of malware, obfuscated, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0, with high confidence. No modifications are necessary.",
