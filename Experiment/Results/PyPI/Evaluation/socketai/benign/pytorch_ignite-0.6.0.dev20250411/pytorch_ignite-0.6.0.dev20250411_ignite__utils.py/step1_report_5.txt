  "purpose": "Exports specific utility functions from the ignite.utils module for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from the ignite.utils module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and lacks any suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports functions from a well-known library (ignite.utils) and defines an __all__ list for module exports. It is a standard pattern for Python modules, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. The functions imported are commonly used for tensor manipulations in PyTorch-based projects, and their presence alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal module exporting specific utility functions from the ignite.utils library. No malicious activity or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
