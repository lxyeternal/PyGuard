The use of wildcard import from _patch is typical for SDK patching and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily associated with the pattern of SDK patching, which is standard practice."

The unconventional error handling could cause malformed URLs but does not constitute a security threat. The assigned scores are consistent and appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, generated SDK client for Azure Purview with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The request handling is typical, and no backdoors or malicious payloads are present. The minor concern about external manipulation of 'request.url' is a common consideration in SDK design but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk."

The only notable issue is a typo in method names, which should be corrected for proper execution. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The overall security risk is very low."
