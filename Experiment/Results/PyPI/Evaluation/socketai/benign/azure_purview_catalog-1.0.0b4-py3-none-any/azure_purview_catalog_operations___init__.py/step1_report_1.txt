{
  "purpose": "The code sets up imports for various operations and patches within a Python SDK or library, and defines the __all__ list for module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_operations and _patch), and the extension of __all__ with elements from _patch_all.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any obvious sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Imports and __all__ extension do not involve untrusted data flow; no source-to-sink data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a wildcard import ('from ._patch import *'), which can be a potential risk for importing unexpected or malicious code, but it is a common pattern in generated SDK code. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard generated SDK module, importing various operation classes and patch functions, then defining the module's export list. The wildcard import from _patch could potentially be risky, but in the context of SDK code generation, it is usually controlled. No network, file, or execution operations are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or code injection.",
  "conclusion": "This code is typical of a generated SDK setup with no evident malicious intent. The wildcard import warrants attention but is standard in such contexts. No malware or security risks are identified.",
