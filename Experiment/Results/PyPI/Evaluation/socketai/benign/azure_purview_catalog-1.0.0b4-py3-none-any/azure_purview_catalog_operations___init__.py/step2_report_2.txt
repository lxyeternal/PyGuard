  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n\n- All five reports agree that the code is part of an auto-generated SDK, primarily involving import statements, __all__ setup, and a call to `_patch_sdk()`.\n- They note the use of wildcard imports (`from ._patch import *`) as a common pattern in generated SDK code, though potentially risky for namespace pollution.\n- No network, file, or execution of untrusted code is observed.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or signs of malicious behavior are present.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), and the malware scores are zero across all reports.\n- The security risk scores are low (~0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the minor concern about wildcard imports but no real security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any actual malicious activity, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n- The wildcard import is a potential concern but is standard in generated SDKs and not inherently malicious.\n\n### Errors or Flaws:\n- The main flaw is the use of `from ._patch import *`, which can cause namespace pollution and make the code less explicit. However, this is common in SDK code generation and not necessarily a security issue.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity or code behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the lack of malicious activity, the low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is appropriate. The wildcard import, while not ideal, does not elevate the risk significantly.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK module setup.\n- No evidence of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The only concern is the wildcard import, which is a common pattern but should be reviewed in broader contexts.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Keep low (~0.1-0.2), as the code is boilerplate SDK code with no active security issues.\n\n**In conclusion,** I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is safe, with no malicious activity detected. The minor concern about wildcard imports is typical in generated SDKs and does not constitute a security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with reports)\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9–1)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and aligns with the provided reports.",
