  "purpose": "Setup of SDK module with imported operations and patching functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules and the wildcard import from ._patch.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements and the call to _patch_sdk() without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from ._patch import *' which can cause namespace pollution, but is common in generated SDK code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard auto-generated SDK module initializer, importing various internal operation classes, extending __all__, and invoking a patch function. No network, file, or dynamic code execution is present. The wildcard import is a known pattern in SDKs but can pose namespace risks; however, it is controlled within this context. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is detected. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's nature and potential minor import-related concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK setup with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The wildcard import, while generally discouraged, is standard in generated SDKs and does not pose a significant threat here. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code is safe.",
