  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Standard import setup, no suspicious activity, wildcard import is common in generated SDKs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the potential risk of wildcard import but notes it is controlled in SDK context. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** The scoring seems reasonable; the low risk score aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the controlled context of SDK generation, wildcard import is discouraged but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is appropriate given the lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, standard SDK code, no signs of malicious activity, wildcard import is typical in generated code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The low risk score is justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern, no malicious activity, wildcard import used in SDK context.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as others, standard SDK code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, matching the straightforward, generated code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation between 0.1 and 0.2, reflecting minor concerns about wildcard import but acknowledging it's common in SDKs.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and reasonable.\n- The use of wildcard import (`from ._patch import *`) is a known pattern in generated SDKs, and while it can be risky in untrusted code, in this context, it is controlled and standard.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n### My Own Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and generated.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to wildcard import pattern, which is typical in SDKs but warrants cautious review in broader contexts.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical auto-generated SDK module with no malicious or obfuscated content. The risk score should remain low, around 0.1, reflecting the minor concern about import practices but no actual threat.\n\n**Final note:** Continue monitoring for any dynamic or runtime behaviors, but based on static analysis, this code is safe.",
