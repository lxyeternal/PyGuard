  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a standard SDK module setup, primarily importing various internal modules and defining the public API via `__all__`.\n   - The only notable anomaly is the use of `from ._patch import *`, which is common in generated SDKs but can pose namespace pollution risks.\n   - No network calls, file operations, or execution of untrusted code are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report:**\n   - The reports correctly identify the wildcard import as a potential risk but also contextualize it as a common pattern in SDK code generation.\n   - They do not overstate the risk; instead, they recognize that in this context, it is unlikely malicious.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are apparent in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, reflecting no malicious activity.\n   - Security risk scores are low (~0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the context.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, which is accurate.\n   - The confidence levels are high (~0.9 to 1), appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score above 0.5, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any risky operations, so high risk scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - No malicious behavior is observed or claimed.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they recognize the wildcard import as a common pattern in generated SDKs.\n   - They do not suggest vulnerabilities or malicious intent based solely on this pattern.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: low risk, no malware, no obfuscation.\n   - The minor concern about the wildcard import is acknowledged but not overemphasized.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (very low, standard SDK pattern)\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical auto-generated SDK module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The wildcard import, while generally discouraged, is standard in such contexts and does not indicate malicious behavior.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- No changes needed; the code is safe.\n- Maintain awareness of wildcard imports in broader code reviews, but in this context, it is acceptable.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (reflecting the minor concern about wildcard import but overall very safe)",
