  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, code logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a standard SDK client for Azure Purview.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network request via `send_request`; input data flows from the request object.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is typical SDK boilerplate with no malicious intent. The confidence score is high (0.9), and malware/risk scores are low (0). This aligns with the code content.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard SDK patterns.\n- No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- Confidence is even higher (1.0), malware and risk scores are minimal.\n- The reasoning is consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on URL formatting and request handling.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, only standard SDK patterns.\n- Confidence is slightly lower (0.95), but still very high.\n- Malware and risk scores are low, consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights potential for untrusted data in `send_request`.\n- Notes that `request` can contain untrusted data, which could be exploited if malicious input is supplied.\n- However, the code uses `deepcopy` and standard SDK practices, with no signs of malicious code.\n- The report emphasizes that the code is boilerplate and safe.\n- Confidence is 0.9, malware and risk scores are low, aligning with the code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to previous reports, noting that URL formatting could be influenced if external input affects `request.url`.\n- Still, the code relies on safe practices, and no malicious behavior is evident.\n- Confidence is 0.9, malware and risk scores are low.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Presence of Malicious Behavior:** None observed. All reports conclude the code is standard SDK boilerplate.\n- **Obfuscation & Hardcoded Secrets:** None detected.\n- **Request Handling & Data Flows:** Typical for SDK clients; potential for misuse exists only if external inputs are maliciously crafted, but no evidence suggests this is happening here.\n- **Scores Justification:**\n  - Malware score remains at 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis.\n  - Obfuscated score is 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n  - Risk scores are low (~0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal concern for security risks given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (standard SDK client, minimal security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is a legitimate SDK client with no indications of supply chain security issues or malicious intent.**",
