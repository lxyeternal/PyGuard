{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and imports components for a Microsoft Purview Catalog client, setting up patches and exports for use in a larger SDK or application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_client, _patch) and conditional import of _patch components.",
  "sinks": "None of the import statements involve untrusted data or external inputs at runtime; no data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from module imports to patch application, with no dynamic or untrusted data passed or executed.",
  "anomalies": "The use of wildcard import ('from ._patch import *') can obscure what is imported but is a common pattern in generated SDK code. No suspicious or malicious anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup for a generated SDK module, importing a client class and optional patch components. It handles missing patch modules gracefully and applies patches via a function call. The use of wildcard import is typical in auto-generated code and not inherently malicious. There are no hardcoded secrets, network calls, or other suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard SDK boilerplate for setting up a client with optional patching. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
