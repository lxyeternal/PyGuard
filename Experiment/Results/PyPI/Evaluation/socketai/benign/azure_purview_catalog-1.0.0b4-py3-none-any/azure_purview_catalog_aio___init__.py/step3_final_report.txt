  "purpose": "SDK boilerplate setup for Microsoft Purview Catalog Client, including optional patch imports and application.",
  "sources": "Module imports, conditional patch import, and patch application function call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external data, network activity, or secrets involved.",
  "flows": "Import statements and patch function calls without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (`from ._patch import *`) which can obscure imported symbols but is common in generated SDK code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a generated SDK setup script that imports core components, handles optional patches, and applies patches via a function call. No external data, network activity, or secrets are present. The wildcard import, while generally risky, is standard in SDK code generation. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the context, with the minor risk due to wildcard import and dynamic patching. Overall, the code is benign, and the reports accurately reflect this.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard SDK boilerplate with no malicious or security risks. The assigned scores are justified, and there is no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
