{
  "purpose": "This code appears to set up imports and patches for the Microsoft Purview Catalog client, facilitating the extension or modification of its behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_client, _patch) and potential dynamic patching through _patch.patch_sdk()",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no data outputs, network calls, or sensitive operations are present",
  "flows": "The code imports modules, applies patches, and extends the __all__ list, with no untrusted data flow or external effects",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) which can introduce unintended or obscure behaviors, and dynamic patch application; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages module imports and applies patches to a client class. It includes a try-except block to handle missing modules gracefully, which is standard practice. The wildcard import could be considered risky in other contexts, but here it is used for patching purposes. The patch_sdk() call at the end likely modifies or extends SDK functionality, but no malicious behavior is evident. There are no network, file, or data leak operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for SDK extensions and does not contain malicious intent. The use of wildcard import and dynamic patching warrants standard caution, but no malicious or security-compromising behavior is detected.",
