  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the security implications and ensure the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code initializes SDK components, handles optional patches, and uses wildcard import for patches.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no external data, no network calls. Wildcard import is typical in generated code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is boilerplate SDK setup with no malicious intent. The wildcard import, while risky in general, is standard here.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep scores as-is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with focus on import setup and patch application.\n- **Findings:** No external data or network activity. Wildcard import is common in generated SDKs.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious behavior detected. The reasoning aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep scores as-is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Import setup with dynamic patching via `_patch.patch_sdk()`.\n- **Findings:** No data sinks, no external data, only patching. Wildcard import used.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly higher at 0.2, possibly due to dynamic patching and wildcard import.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is cautious but reasonable. Dynamic patching can sometimes be risky if patches are malicious, but here, it's part of SDK extension. No malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Justification for risk score 0.2:** Since patching functions can modify behavior, but are part of SDK design, a low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Recommendation:** Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with conditional import and patch application.\n- **Findings:** No external data, no network, no secrets. Wildcard import is standard in generated code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The risk score is very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep scores as-is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** SDK initialization with patching, no external data.\n- **Findings:** No external communication, no secrets, only module imports and patch application.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is boilerplate SDK setup, with standard patterns.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep scores as-is.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, as the code is straightforward and generated.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are justified given the use of wildcard imports and dynamic patching, but these are typical in SDK code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (average, considering all reports)  \n\nThe code is standard SDK boilerplate with no malicious or security-compromising behavior. The minor risk scores reflect cautious acknowledgment of wildcard imports and dynamic patching but are not indicative of actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- No changes needed to scores.  \n- The code is safe and standard for SDK setup.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** The overall security assessment confirms that this code is benign and typical for SDK initialization, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
