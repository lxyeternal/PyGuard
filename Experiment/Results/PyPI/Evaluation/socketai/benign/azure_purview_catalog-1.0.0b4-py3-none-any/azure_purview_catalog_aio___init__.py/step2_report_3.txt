  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is a standard SDK boilerplate, generated by AutoRest, involving module imports, optional patching, and setup.\n- The use of wildcard imports (`from ._patch import *`) is common in generated code but can obscure what is imported.\n- There are no external data inputs, network calls, or data sinks.\n- No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- The `patch_sdk()` function is invoked at the end, likely to modify or extend SDK behavior, which is typical in SDK customization.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious activity or code is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and generated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 or very low, as no vulnerabilities or security issues are identified.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n- The reports correctly identify the use of wildcard imports as potentially risky but contextualize it as typical for generated SDK code.\n- The reports seem consistent in their assessment that the code is benign and standard boilerplate.\n\n### Scoring Suggestions:\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1 to 0.2). Given the code's nature, this seems appropriate.\n- The malware scores are correctly at 0.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n\n### Justifications:\n- Since the code is auto-generated SDK setup, the risk of malicious activity is negligible.\n- The use of wildcard imports, while risky in hand-written code, is standard in generated SDKs and not inherently malicious.\n- No external data, secrets, or network activity is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 (a minimal potential concern due to wildcard import, but standard in generated code)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign SDK boilerplate with no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own scores based on this analysis, I would agree with the current assessments:\n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (to reflect the wildcard import concern but recognizing its standard use in generated code)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe.",
