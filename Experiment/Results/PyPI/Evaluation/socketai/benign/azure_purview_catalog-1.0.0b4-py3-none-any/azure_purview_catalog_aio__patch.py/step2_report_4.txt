  "review": "Let's review the provided code and reports carefully.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- The code is a standard template with license headers and a single function `patch_sdk()` that does nothing.\n- No input/output, data processing, or external communication.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Findings:\n- **Presence of malicious activity or data leaks:** None. The code is a benign placeholder.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None, as the code is a no-op template.\n- **Malware indicators:** Absent.\n- **Data flows:** None, as the function is empty and only contains comments.\n\n### Review of the Reports:\n- All five reports agree that the code is a standard, benign SDK extension placeholder.\n- They correctly identify the code as a template with no operational logic, data handling, or suspicious activity.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, which is appropriate given the clear benign nature.\n\n### Scoring and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is justified. No malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and well-commented.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate, as there's no security risk.\n\n### Critical Observations:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the analysis is based on the code content.\n- The code's purpose as a placeholder for SDK extensions is correctly identified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, I concur with the assessments:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**These scores accurately reflect the benign, standard nature of the code.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, standard SDK extension placeholder with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The reports are consistent and justified in their conclusions.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.",
