  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a straightforward template with licensing comments and an empty function `patch_sdk()`. There are no data inputs, outputs, or logic. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly interpret the code as a standard placeholder for SDK extension, with no suspicious behavior. No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. The obfuscated score is also 0, which is appropriate. The confidence level is 1, indicating certainty in their assessment. These scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all evidence points to benign, static, placeholder code with no data handling, no external communication, and no malicious patterns, there is no justification for higher risk scores. The code is essentially a no-op template.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they interpret the code accurately. They do not speculate about potential vulnerabilities beyond what is evident.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report Content**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis code is a benign, standard SDK extension placeholder with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. No changes to the scoring or conclusions are necessary. The code poses no security threat, and the current scores correctly reflect its benign nature.",
