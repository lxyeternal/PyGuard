{
  "purpose": "Placeholder function for handwritten SDK extensions or patches, serving as a template for customization.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only comments and an empty function definition.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the function does nothing and contains no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with only licensing comments and an empty function.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, benign template with licensing headers and an empty function 'patch_sdk()'. It contains no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or suspicious constructs. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. All reports correctly identify it as a standard placeholder with no operational logic or security concerns. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. There are no anomalies or signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK extension placeholder with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. All reports accurately assess its safety, and no further action or concern is warranted.",
