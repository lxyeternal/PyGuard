  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Code Content:**\n- The code is a standard header with licensing info.\n- It defines a single function `patch_sdk()` that does nothing.\n- No data inputs, outputs, external calls, or data flows.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks.\n- The code appears to be a placeholder or template for SDK extension.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues in the code:** No, the code is benign, contains only comments and an empty function.\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:** No, all reports correctly identify the code as a benign placeholder with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which are reasonable given the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is appropriate. No malicious activity or code is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; the code is straightforward and transparent.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is justified; the code is a benign template with no security issues.\n\n### Logical or reasoning flaws:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities; the analysis is based solely on the static code provided.\n- No suspicious patterns or behaviors are claimed or implied.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Assessment:\nBased on all reports and the code review, I agree with the assessments: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0**.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard SDK extension placeholder with no security concerns or malicious intent.",
