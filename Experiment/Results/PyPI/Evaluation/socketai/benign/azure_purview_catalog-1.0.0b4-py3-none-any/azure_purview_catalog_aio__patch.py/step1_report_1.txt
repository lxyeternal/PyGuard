{
  "purpose": "The code provides a template or placeholder for handwritten extensions to SDK-generated code, primarily used for patching or customizing SDK behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads static comments, licensing information, and a function definition with no inputs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or vulnerabilities; the function does nothing and there is no untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist, as the function is empty and only contains comments and a no-op function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists of standard licensing comments and an empty function definition with no suspicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code includes license headers and a single function 'patch_sdk()' that does nothing. There are no data inputs, outputs, or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a standard template for SDK patching, with no malicious or maliciously intended code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a placeholder for SDK extensions. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected.",
