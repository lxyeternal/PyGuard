  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a standard, minimal placeholder for SDK extension or patching.\n- It contains only licensing comments and an empty function `patch_sdk()`.\n- There are no data inputs, outputs, external calls, or suspicious constructs.\n- No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Correctly identifies the code as benign, with no data flows or malicious intent.\n- The reasoning is sound; the code is a template.\n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Same conclusions; the code is a benign placeholder.\n- The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n- Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Also correctly states that the code is a boilerplate placeholder with no malicious activity.\n- The analysis and scores are consistent.\n- No change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar assessment; benign, standard SDK extension stub.\n- Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same reasoning; benign placeholder.\n- Scores are appropriate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and well-documented.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no security risks or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a benign, standard SDK extension placeholder.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action or concern is warranted.",
