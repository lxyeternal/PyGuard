{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a placeholder for handwritten extensions to a generated SDK, allowing for customization and patching.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or data; it only defines an empty function.",
  "targets": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; no data or code execution occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the function is empty and does not process any input or output.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard licensing and documentation comments; no suspicious or unusual code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code includes license information and an empty function definition intended for manual extension. There are no dynamic or obfuscated elements, no external input handling, and no potential security risks. The code appears to be a benign template or stub for further customization.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign placeholder with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated elements. It is a standard pattern for SDK extension points.",
