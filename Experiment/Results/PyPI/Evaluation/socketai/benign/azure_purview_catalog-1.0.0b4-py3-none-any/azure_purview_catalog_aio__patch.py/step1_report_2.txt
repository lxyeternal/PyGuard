{
  "purpose": "This code provides a template for handwritten extensions to SDK-generated code, specifically for patching or customizing the SDK behavior.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; no external data is being read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where data is processed or transmitted; no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving sources and sinks; the function is a placeholder with no logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard, well-documented template with licensing information and a no-op function; no unusual or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments and a single function definition 'patch_sdk' that does nothing. There are no data inputs, outputs, or logic that could be exploited or used maliciously. The structure and comments are typical of open-source SDK extensions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign template intended for SDK patching with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a standard, safe placeholder with no suspicious elements.",
