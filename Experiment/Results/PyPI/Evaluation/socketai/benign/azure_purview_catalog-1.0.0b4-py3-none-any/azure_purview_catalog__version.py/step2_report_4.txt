  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code snippet is a minimal, auto-generated header with a version string assignment.\n   - No dynamic code, external input handling, network activity, or obfuscated logic is present.\n   - The code is standard boilerplate, with license comments and a static string assignment.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no suspicious constructs.\n   - No logical flaws or inaccuracies are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports suggest any behavior that would warrant a higher risk score.\n   - The code is simple metadata, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n   - Therefore, risk scores above 0.5 are unjustified here.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - No malicious activity or intent is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports are cautious but accurate, avoiding unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They correctly interpret the code as boilerplate, with no hidden malicious intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, benign auto-generated header containing only a version string and license comments. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final Recommendation:** No changes to scores; the current assessment is accurate.",
