  "purpose": "Define a version string for the package or module, serving as metadata.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of VERSION variable; license and copyright comments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward, auto-generated header with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, static header containing license comments and a version string assignment. It contains no dynamic behavior, data flow, or external interactions. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify this as benign, auto-generated metadata. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (near 1). No anomalies or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version header with no malicious or security concerns. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
