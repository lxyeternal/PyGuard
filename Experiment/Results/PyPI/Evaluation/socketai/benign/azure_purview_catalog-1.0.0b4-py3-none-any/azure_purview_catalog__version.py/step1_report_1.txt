{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define version information for a Python package or module, likely generated automatically by a code generation tool.",
  "sources": "Constant assignment of VERSION variable, no input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points present in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, with no suspicious constructs, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard header with license information and a version string assignment. It was generated automatically, with no evident malicious code, obfuscated logic, or external data handling. There are no source-to-sink flows or any dynamic code execution. The file appears benign and typical for auto-generated SDK or API client code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard boilerplate header with no concerning elements.",
