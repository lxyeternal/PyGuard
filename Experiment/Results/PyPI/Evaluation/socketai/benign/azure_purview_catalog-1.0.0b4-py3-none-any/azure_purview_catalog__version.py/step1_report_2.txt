  "purpose": "The code defines a version string for a package or module, likely used for version tracking and compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "The version string 'VERSION = \"1.0.0b4\"' is a hardcoded constant assigned at the top of the file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data, user input, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present; the code only assigns a static string value.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden behavior, or suspicious constructs are evident. The code appears to be boilerplate generated by a code generator.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a license notice, a copyright statement, a comment about code generation, and a static version string assignment. There are no dynamic operations, no external input handling, and no potentially malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be boilerplate version definition with no malicious intent.",
