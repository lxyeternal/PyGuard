  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is primarily licensing comments and a single placeholder function `patch_sdk()` with no implementation.\n- No data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are evident.\n- The function is intended as an extension point for SDK customization.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code is a benign template with no executable logic or data flow.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Score Reasonableness:** Appropriate.  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk).  \n**Overall:** Sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar reasoning as Report 1, emphasizing the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Score Reasonableness:** Appropriate.  \n**Risk score:** 0.  \n**Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same as above, highlighting the lack of suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Score Reasonableness:** Appropriate.  \n**Risk score:** 0.  \n**Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Consistent with previous assessments; no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Score Reasonableness:** Appropriate.  \n**Risk score:** 0.  \n**Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same conclusion: benign, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Score Reasonableness:** Appropriate.  \n**Risk score:** 0.  \n**Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a benign template with no malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior that aren't supported by the code.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, benign SDK extension template with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n- The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scoring aligns with the code's content.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms that the code is harmless and the reports are justified.",
