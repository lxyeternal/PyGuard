{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a placeholder for handwritten extensions to SDK-generated code, allowing customization without altering core functionality.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or data; it contains only licensing comments and an empty function definition.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the function is empty and does not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign template with licensing comments and an empty placeholder function. It contains no input sources, data flows, or sink points. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The function is intended for future SDK customization, and as provided, it poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard SDK extension template with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring should reflect this.",
