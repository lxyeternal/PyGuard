{
  "purpose": "The code provides a placeholder function for custom modifications or extensions to a generated SDK, specifically for patching or customizing the SDK's behavior.",
  "sources": "The code does not read any external input or data sources.",
  "targets": "The code does not process or send data to any sink; it merely defines an empty function.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as the function is empty and no external interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive licensing and copyright comments, but no suspicious or unusual code behaviors. The 'patch_sdk' function is a placeholder with no implementation, which is normal in extension points but could be exploited if misused. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily composed of licensing comments and a single, empty function intended for user-defined SDK patching. There are no input sources, data flows, or sink points. The absence of executable code beyond the placeholder indicates a benign intent. The only potential concern is misuse of the extension point, but that alone is not malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a safe template for SDK customization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template for SDK extensions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Its simplicity and lack of executable logic mean it does not pose any security threat.",
