  "purpose": "This code provides a template for handwritten extensions to SDK-generated code, allowing customization via the patch_sdk() function.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from source to sink, as the code does not handle data or execute untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with a licensing header and an empty function. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing information, comments, and an empty placeholder function. No data input, external connections, or malicious behavior is evident. The structure is straightforward and typical for SDK extension points.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this code snippet. It is a benign template for extending SDK functionality, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
