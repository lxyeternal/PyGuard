  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's content, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple template with licensing comments and an empty function `patch_sdk()`.\n- There are no input sources, data flows, or sink points.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The code is intended as a placeholder for SDK customization.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as a placeholder for SDK extensions.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior; benign template.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the placeholder nature.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Code presence:** The code is a benign, boilerplate template with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n- **Malware potential:** None detected; the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risk:** The code itself poses no security risk.\n- **Potential misuse:** The only theoretical concern is that this extension point could be misused if an attacker injects malicious code into the placeholder, but the code as provided is safe and the risk is minimal.\n\n### Final scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a safe, standard template with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's nature.",
