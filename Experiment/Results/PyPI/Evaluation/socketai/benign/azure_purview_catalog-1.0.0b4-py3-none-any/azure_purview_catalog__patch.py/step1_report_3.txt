{
  "purpose": "This code provides a placeholder function for SDK customization and includes licensing information, intended for handwritten extensions to SDK-generated code.",
  "sources": "The code reads static comments, license information, and a function definition with no input handling.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, external data sources, or output functions that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists involving untrusted sources or sensitive sinks; the function 'patch_sdk' is empty and does not execute any operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only licensing comments and an empty placeholder function with no logic or executable content; no anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments, a no-operation placeholder function, and no dynamic or input-driven code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a standard template or extension point for SDK customization, with no evidence of malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a placeholder for SDK extensions. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious elements.",
