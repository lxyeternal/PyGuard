  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as a simple, boilerplate placeholder for SDK extension, with no input/output, data flow, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code is unmodified, contains only licensing comments and an empty function.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- The reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. It is a benign template.\n- **Errors or flaws in the report:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- **Scores:** The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n### Justifications:\n- The code does not perform any operations, handle data, or include any malicious constructs.\n- The only potential concern could be misuse of the extension point, but that is not a security risk per se, just a potential for misuse, which is not a malware or obfuscation issue.\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the benign observation.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis matches the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the code as a benign, placeholder extension point with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. The code is safe and poses no security threat.",
