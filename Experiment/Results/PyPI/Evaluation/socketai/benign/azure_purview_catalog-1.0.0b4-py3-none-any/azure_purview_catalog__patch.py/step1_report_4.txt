{
  "purpose": "The code provides a template for handwritten extensions to an SDK, with a placeholder function for patching the SDK.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is largely boilerplate with a placeholder function 'patch_sdk' that does nothing; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code includes licensing comments and an empty function definition intended for future extensions. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or system modifications. There are no input sources, data flows, or outputs. It appears to be a standard template or scaffold for SDK customization. No malicious intent or security issues are detectable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a placeholder for SDK extensions. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
