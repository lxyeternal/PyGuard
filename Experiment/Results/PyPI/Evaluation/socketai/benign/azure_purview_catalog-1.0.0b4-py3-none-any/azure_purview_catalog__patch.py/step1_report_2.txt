{
  "purpose": "The code provides a template for handwritten extensions to SDK-generated code, specifically a placeholder function for patching SDK behavior.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks, such as data output or untrusted data handling, in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a simple function definition with no implementation or dynamic code execution. There are no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a boilerplate template with a license header, followed by an empty function 'patch_sdk'. There are no inputs, outputs, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be intended for future extension and does not perform any operations or data manipulation. No malicious or security-risk patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign template with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a placeholder for future SDK patching and contains no suspicious or harmful behavior.",
