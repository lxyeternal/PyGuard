  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a simple template with licensing comments and an empty function `patch_sdk()`.\n   - No input sources, data flows, or output sinks are present.\n   - No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code detected.\n   - The code is benign and intended for SDK extension purposes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as a benign placeholder.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The conclusion that the code is safe and non-malicious is justified.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign scores of `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score here is 0, which is appropriate.\n   - No justification exists for higher scores, as there's no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - This is consistent and justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the absence of suspicious activity.\n   - The code is straightforward, and the analysis aligns with its simplicity.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - They accurately reflect the benign and non-obfuscated nature of the code.\n\n**Summary of my assessment:**\n- The code is a benign template for SDK extensions.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:** This code is a safe, standard extension point template with no security concerns.",
