{
  "purpose": "This code initializes an SDK module by importing core components, setting version info, and applying optional patches, serving as a setup for the SDK environment.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_client, _version, _patch), version assignment, and conditional import of patch functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows; no network, file, or user input handling present.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules, assigns version, and executes patch functions without data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from _patch, which could be risky but is standard in SDK patching contexts; try-except block for optional import is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated SDK bootstrap module. It performs imports, sets version info, and applies patches. The wildcard import from _patch is common in SDKs for patching purposes, and the try-except ensures safe optional import. No untrusted data, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. The code's simplicity and standard pattern indicate benign intent. The wildcard import, while a minor concern in some contexts, is acceptable here given its purpose and controlled environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated SDK initialization script with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The use of wildcard import from _patch is typical for SDK patching and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily associated with the pattern of SDK patching, which is standard practice.",
