  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated SDK initialization script with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The use of wildcard import from _patch is typical for SDK patching and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily associated with the pattern of SDK patching, which is standard practice."
