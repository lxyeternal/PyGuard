{
  "purpose": "This code sets up module imports, versioning, and patching for the PurviewCatalogClient library, primarily for SDK functionality and patch application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_client, _version, _patch).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data output observed.",
  "flows": "Imports load local modules; _patch_sdk() is called without untrusted data; no external data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses wildcard import from _patch, which can sometimes be risky, but here it's within a try-except block for safe import fallback. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports local modules and manages versioning and patching procedures for a client SDK. The try-except block ensures safe import handling for optional patch modules, and the patch SDK function is invoked at the end. No external data sources, no suspicious logic, or malicious indicators are present. The code appears to be standard SDK setup code generated by a code generator, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly manages module imports, versioning, and patching setup without external data handling or suspicious logic.",
