  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a generated SDK module with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — standard SDK setup.\n- **Notes:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, with no anomalies or malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with detailed analysis of imports and patching.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — slightly elevated, primarily due to the wildcard import from `_patch`.\n- **Notes:** Wildcard import can be risky in some contexts, but here it’s likely used for patching extensions, which is common in SDKs. No malicious behavior is evident.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, emphasizing standard SDK setup.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — consistent with standard SDK initialization.\n- **Notes:** No suspicious patterns or malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar, focusing on versioning and patching.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low, mainly due to the wildcard import.\n- **Notes:** The code remains standard for SDK setup.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same general conclusion, emphasizing safe module imports and patching.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — again, minor concern over wildcard import.\n- **Notes:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None of the reports identify any malware or malicious activity. The code is a typical auto-generated SDK bootstrap module.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed. The code is straightforward, with clear imports and setup.\n- **Security Risks:** Very low, primarily related to the wildcard import from `_patch`. However, in the context of SDK patching, this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious.\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No evidence of vulnerabilities; the code does not process untrusted input, does not handle sensitive data, and lacks network or file operations.\n\n### **Conclusion & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at **0**, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the minimal security concerns and the benign nature of the code, a **risk score of 0.1–0.2** is appropriate, aligning with the reports.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2\n\nThis code is a standard, auto-generated SDK setup module with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The minor concerns about wildcard imports are typical in such contexts and do not elevate the risk significantly.",
