{
  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python package, importing necessary modules and setting up the package's version and patching mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (_client, _version, _patch) and the dynamic import of all symbols from _patch if available.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or execution. The code does not process external input or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "Imports and patching functions are called during module load, with no data flow involving external untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The use of wildcard import from _patch and dynamic extension of __all__ could be suspicious if misused, but are common in auto-generated SDK code. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated SDK initialization code, setting up imports and versioning. It conditionally imports a patch module and applies patches via _patch_sdk(). There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leaks, or code injection. The wildcard import is typical for SDK patching and does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. No sensitive data or credentials are handled. Overall, the code appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard auto-generated SDK bootstrap script with no malicious behavior or security issues. It performs module imports, version setup, and applies patches as intended for SDK initialization.",
