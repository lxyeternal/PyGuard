  "purpose": "Client SDK functions for Azure Data Catalog to import entity metadata and glossary terms, including long-running operations and CSV uploads.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as 'files', 'headers', 'params', and 'content' used to construct HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request objects sent over the network; responses deserialized into JSON or response objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into request headers, URL, query parameters, and body; responses flow into deserialized data.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated typo in method name: 'build_entity_import_business_metadata_reques' (missing 't'), likely an incomplete or generated code fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs and sends HTTP requests for metadata import operations, manages long-running operations with polling, and handles responses. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or malicious code are present. The recurring typo suggests an incomplete code snippet or code generation artifact, not malicious intent. The code is straightforward, following standard SDK patterns, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Azure SDK client component for managing metadata imports. The only notable issue is a typo in method names, which should be corrected for proper execution. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity. The overall security risk is very low.",
