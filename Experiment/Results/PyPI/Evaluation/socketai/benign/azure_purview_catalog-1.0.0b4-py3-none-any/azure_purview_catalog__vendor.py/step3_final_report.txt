  "anomalies": "Use of key.args[0] on KeyError, unconventional error handling that modifies the template upon missing keys",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to format a URL template with provided kwargs. If a KeyError occurs, it splits the template and removes components containing the missing key, then retries. The use of key.args[0] is valid but unconventional; the error handling could cause malformed URLs or infinite loops. No network, file, or system operations are present. The string formatting operation could be exploited if kwargs contain malicious data, but this is a standard risk. No signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature and flawed error handling, which could lead to URL issues but not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign URL formatting utility with flawed but non-malicious error handling. No evidence of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The unconventional error handling could cause malformed URLs but does not constitute a security threat. The assigned scores are consistent and appropriate.",
