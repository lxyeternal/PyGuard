  "purpose": "Format URL sections based on a template string with provided keyword arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'template' parameter and '**kwargs' for formatting data.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'template.format(**kwargs)' which could potentially execute arbitrary formatting if inputs are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Input 'template' and '**kwargs' flow into 'template.format(**kwargs)'.",
  "anomalies": "The exception handling loop attempts to reformat the template by removing components containing problematic keys. The use of string formatting with external input is a potential risk, but no explicit malicious code or backdoor is present.",
  "analysis": "The function splits the input 'template' by '/' and attempts to format it with '**kwargs'. If a KeyError occurs, it filters out components containing the problematic key and retries formatting. This process could lead to unpredictable behavior if the inputs are maliciously crafted but does not inherently execute malicious code. No suspicious or malicious patterns like code injection, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are detected. The code appears to be a utility function for URL construction with error handling for missing keys.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a URL formatting utility that handles missing keys gracefully. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage indicators. The use of string formatting is standard, and no suspicious patterns are observed.",
