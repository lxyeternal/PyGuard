  "purpose": "This function formats a URL template by substituting placeholders with provided keyword arguments.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the 'template' string and '**kwargs' for substitution.",
  "sinks": "The code performs string formatting and manipulation, but does not interact with untrusted external data sources or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Input: 'template' and '**kwargs' -> Processing: splitting and formatting -> Output: formatted URL string.",
  "anomalies": "The exception handling loop appears unnecessary and potentially problematic; it modifies the template in a way that could cause unexpected behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The function attempts to format a URL template string with provided keyword arguments. If a KeyError occurs during formatting, it tries to modify the template by removing components containing the missing key. The loop may lead to infinite retries if the template always raises KeyError, but this is a standard pattern for attempting fallback formatting. The code does not contain malicious logic, obfuscated code, or security-critical vulnerabilities. It is typical template formatting logic with somewhat convoluted error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL formatting utility with an unusual exception handling approach. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The main concern is the inefficiency and potential infinite loop risk in the exception handling, but it does not represent malicious activity.",
