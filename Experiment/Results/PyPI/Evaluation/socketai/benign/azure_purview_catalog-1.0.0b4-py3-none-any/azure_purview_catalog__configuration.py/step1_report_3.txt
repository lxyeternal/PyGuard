  "purpose": "Define a configuration class for the PurviewCatalogClient to manage connection settings and policies.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters: 'endpoint', 'credential', and optional keyword arguments like 'api_version' and other policies.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of credential and endpoint; creation of policies; setting of 'authentication_policy' with credential-based policy.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → validation → attribute assignment → policy creation → optional credential-based authentication policy setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. Policy creation is standard, no data leaks or malicious actions observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition for configuring a client connection to an Azure service. It validates essential parameters ('endpoint' and 'credential'), assigns attributes, and creates various policies used in HTTP request handling. The policies and credential management are consistent with Azure SDK practices. No external data inputs are used unsafely, and no suspicious behavior or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK configuration class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical validation and policy setup for Azure SDK clients, with no indicators of malicious or sabotage behavior.",
