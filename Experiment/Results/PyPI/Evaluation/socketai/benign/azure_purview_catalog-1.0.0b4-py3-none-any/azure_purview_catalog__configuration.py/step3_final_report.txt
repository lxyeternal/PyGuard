  "purpose": "Configuration class for Azure PurviewCatalogClient, handling parameters, policies, and credentials setup.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: endpoint, credential, optional kwargs such as api_version, credential_scopes, and policy configurations.",
  "sinks": "Credential object used in policies; no external data leaks or network calls within this code.",
  "flows": "Parameters validated and assigned to class attributes; credential passed to policies; policies initialized with provided or default values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; straightforward SDK configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs parameter validation, sets default values, and initializes various policies securely. It relies on standard Azure SDK practices without any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is present. The credential handling is typical and secure, assuming external management. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, configuration nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign SDK configuration class with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate and reflect the low-risk, standard setup. No modifications are necessary.",
