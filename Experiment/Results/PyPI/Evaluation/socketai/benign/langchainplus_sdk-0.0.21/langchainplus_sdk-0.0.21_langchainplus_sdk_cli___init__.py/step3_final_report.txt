  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, dynamic code execution functions (e.g., eval), obfuscated variable names, suspicious modules.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network connections, data exfiltration points, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and eval lead to system or network sinks, indicating potential malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, use of eval, suspicious module imports, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common in malicious scripts. Environment variables are used, possibly to exfiltrate data or configure malicious behavior. The presence of eval and obfuscated variables suggests intent to hide malicious payloads. No clear benign patterns or safe coding practices are observed. The suspicion level is moderate to high, with a malware score of 0.6 and security risk of 0.7, justified by the obfuscation and dynamic execution indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and potential malicious intent, warranting cautious review. While no definitive malicious payload is confirmed, the indicators justify a malware score of 0.6 and a security risk of 0.7, aligning with the suspicion level. Other reports correctly assign low or zero scores due to lack of suspicious features.",
