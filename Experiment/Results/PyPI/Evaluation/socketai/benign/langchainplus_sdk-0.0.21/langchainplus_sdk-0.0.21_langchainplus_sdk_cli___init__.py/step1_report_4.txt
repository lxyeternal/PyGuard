  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing or utility functions, but without specific comments or context, the purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, environment variables, or external modules; no explicit user input sources are visible.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands; these are not clearly identified in the code fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, possibly ending at output or external systems; no explicit dangerous flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual language features are present. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code demonstrates typical Python programming practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior like data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden commands. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are identified in the source, sink, or flow analysis. The code does not include any hardcoded credentials or potentially harmful constructs.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. It seems to serve legitimate purposes without security concerns.",
