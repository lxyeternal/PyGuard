  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code's behavior, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily utility functions for environment detection, message parsing, and API error handling.\n- Uses standard system calls (subprocess) to check Docker presence, versions, etc.\n- Implements message parsing with validation.\n- Uses caching (`lru_cache`) appropriately.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The code is benign, performs standard environment detection, message handling, and error handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — perhaps slightly overestimated; these are utility functions, not high-risk operations.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; utility functions for environment detection and message parsing, safe subprocess calls.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — still reasonable, as these are standard utility functions.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate; no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern; functions for environment info, message parsing, error handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — acceptable, considering the functions are standard.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion; standard environment detection and message handling.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Utility functions for environment detection, message parsing, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — slightly lower, aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0 — high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the code's behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All zero, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly conservative at 0.2 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the functions' nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1–0.2 — low, given the functions are utility routines with system calls that are standard for environment detection.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, benign utility module. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or supply chain sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Estimated Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | 0               |\n| Obfuscated         | 0               |\n| Security Risk      | 0.1–0.2         |\n\nThe overall security posture of this code is very low risk, and it appears trustworthy.",
