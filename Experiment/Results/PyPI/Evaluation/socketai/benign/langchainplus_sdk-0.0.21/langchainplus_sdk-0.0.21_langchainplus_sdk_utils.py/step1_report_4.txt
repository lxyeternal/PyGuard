{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for API error handling, environment detection, message parsing, and Docker management within a larger application or SDK.",
  "sources": "Input data includes 'inputs' and 'outputs' mappings, environment info, and responses from subprocess commands.",
  "sinks": "Response text in raise_for_status_with_text; subprocess commands that could potentially execute system binaries; environment info functions that access system details.",
  "flows": "Response data flows from HTTP responses to error raising; subprocess outputs flow into environment info functions; input/output data are processed and transformed into internal message formats.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to check for Docker commands, which is common but could be exploited if inputs are manipulated; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code or unusual language features; error handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment detection, message parsing, and error handling. subprocess calls check for Docker tools and system info, which are standard operations. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. Error handling is conventional. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious data handling. The functions do not process untrusted user input directly in a way that could cause security issues; responses are used to raise exceptions, and subprocess calls are protected with try-except blocks. The code is well-structured, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module intended for environment detection, message processing, and error handling. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident. It does not perform any harmful actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network attacks. Overall, the code is safe and serves legitimate utility purposes.",
