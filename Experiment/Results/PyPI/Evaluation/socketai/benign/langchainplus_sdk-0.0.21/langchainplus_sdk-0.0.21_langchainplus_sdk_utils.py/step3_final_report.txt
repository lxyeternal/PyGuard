  "purpose": "Utility functions for environment detection, message parsing, and API error handling.",
  "sources": "System commands via subprocess (docker, docker-compose), message and response data structures.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows include subprocess outputs and message data, but all are handled safely with validation.",
  "flows": "System command checks (docker, docker-compose) for environment info; message parsing functions extract data from validated inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of subprocess is standard for environment checks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection, message parsing, and error handling using standard practices. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Exception handling is appropriate, and subprocess calls are protected. The functions validate input formats thoroughly, reducing risk of injection or data leaks. Overall, the code is benign and utility-focused.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility module with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting minimal risk associated with environment detection and message parsing functions.",
