{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for environment detection, message processing, and error handling in language model integrations.",
  "sources": "Reading environment info, making subprocess calls to check Docker versions, processing message and input data.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls, environment variable accesses, and error raising are standard; no dangerous data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows leading to unsafe commands or data leaks; input processing is internal.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. Subprocess calls are standard for environment checks. No obfuscated code or malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for environment info, message parsing, and subprocess calls to detect Docker presence and versions. All subprocess calls are safely wrapped and do not execute untrusted input directly. Error handling is standard, raising exceptions with response text or custom messages. Message processing functions validate message formats thoroughly, avoiding assumptions. No code indicates malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code appears designed for safe environment and message handling within a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utility functions intended for environment detection and message processing. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The functions perform standard environment checks and message parsing with proper validation. Overall, the code appears safe and trustworthy.",
