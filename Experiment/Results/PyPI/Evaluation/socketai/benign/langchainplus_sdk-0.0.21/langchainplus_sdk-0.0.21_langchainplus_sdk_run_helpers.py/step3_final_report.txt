{
  "purpose": "Provides decorators and context managers for creating and managing hierarchical run trees for tracking, logging, or auditing function execution.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), function signatures, context variables (_PARENT_RUN_TREE, _PROJECT_NAME), function arguments, external RunTree methods.",
  "sinks": "Calls to RunTree methods (post(), end(), patch()), creation of RunTree objects, logging warnings.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and function arguments into run creation, execution, and finalization processes.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration, benign warnings about experimental features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a transparent, well-structured utility for function execution tracking, with proper handling of sync and async functions, context management, and exception handling. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. External dependencies are assumed benign. Minor code issues like list concatenation in tags could be improved but do not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate monitoring/tracing utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low malware (0), obfuscation (0), and risk (~0.2) scores are appropriate given its purpose and implementation.",
