  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is straightforward, involving importing modules, retrieving package metadata, and defining exports.\n- No untrusted data, network activity, or suspicious code structures are present.\n- The only potential concern is the use of `importlib.metadata.version(__package__)` with a fallback, which is standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Findings:** No malicious or suspicious behavior; straightforward code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0, Confidence 1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned. No issues.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with mention of a small security risk (0.1). This likely reflects the minimal risk associated with dynamic version retrieval, which is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0.1, Confidence 1.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable. The slight security risk score is justified due to potential (though very low) issues with package metadata handling, but no actual vulnerability exists.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Findings:** Same as above, emphasizing benign behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0, Confidence 1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; standard module initialization.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0, Confidence 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Findings:** Same as above; no issues detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Security Risk 0, Confidence 1.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly varied, with one report assigning 0.1, which is reasonable given the dynamic version retrieval, but still minimal and not indicative of actual risk.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a minimal, standard module setup for a Python SDK.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The small security risk score (0.1) in one report is justified by the nature of dynamic metadata access, which is a common pattern and not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no real security risk; minor and acceptable in context)\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent with the code.**",
