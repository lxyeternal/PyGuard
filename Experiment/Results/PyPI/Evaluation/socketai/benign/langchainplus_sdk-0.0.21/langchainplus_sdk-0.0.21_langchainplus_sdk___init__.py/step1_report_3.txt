{
  "purpose": "To define and export components of the LangSmith client module, including versioning information and SDK imports.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata via importlib.metadata.version(__package__).",
  "sinks": "No data is processed or transmitted; no sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "The only flow involves attempting to retrieve package version info, which is then used internally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.metadata to obtain package version is standard; fallback to empty string if not found is benign. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports required modules and attempts to retrieve its own package version dynamically, handling potential exceptions gracefully. It then defines an __all__ list for exports. The structure is straightforward, with no indications of malicious behavior or unusual patterns. No data leakage, network communication, or malicious code is present. The code appears to serve as an initialization or metadata module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a package initialization script with standard practices. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
