  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements and an `__all__` declaration.\n   - There are no signs of data processing, external inputs, or outputs.\n   - No suspicious or malicious behaviors are indicated or implied.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly conclude that the code is benign and serves as a module interface.\n   - No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Confidence: 1 (high confidence)\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security Risk: 0\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports conclude zero malware, no obfuscation, and no security risks, higher scores are unjustified.\n   - The scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's simplicity and safety.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code only imports classes and declares an export list; no malicious activity or behavior is evident.\n   - Malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's static, straightforward nature.\n   - No unwarranted concerns are raised.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and match the code's characteristics.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- The code is a simple module that imports and re-exports classes from an SDK.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My Final Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign and straightforward nature.",
