{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module exports for evaluation helper classes related to the langchainplus SDK, likely used for evaluating language models or similar components.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'langchainplus_sdk.evaluation' modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks are evident in this static import code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code solely imports classes and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from a language processing evaluation SDK and exposes them via __all__. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no side effects. This pattern is typical for a module setup and does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. No suspicious elements or security risks are detected in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module declaration that exports certain classes from an evaluation SDK. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply facilitates code organization and module exports.",
