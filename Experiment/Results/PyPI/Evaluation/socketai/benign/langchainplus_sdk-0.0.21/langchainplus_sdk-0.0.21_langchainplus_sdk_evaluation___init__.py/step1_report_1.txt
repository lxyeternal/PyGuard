{
  "purpose": "This code defines an interface for evaluation helpers by importing specific classes from a language chain SDK related to evaluation and string evaluation.",
  "sources": "Imports classes EvaluationResult, RunEvaluator, StringEvaluator from langchainplus_sdk.evaluation modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points in this code; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "flows": "The code only imports classes and defines an __all__ list; no data flows or processing occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of import statements and an __all__ declaration. It does not process data, execute untrusted input, or perform any actions that could be malicious. It simply prepares an interface for other code modules to use evaluation classes. No external inputs or outputs are handled, and there are no side effects or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module interface setup with no malicious behavior detected. It is straightforward and safe.",
