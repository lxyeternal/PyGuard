{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module export setup, importing specific classes from an SDK and defining __all__ for external access.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'langchainplus_sdk.evaluation' modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import and export declarations only",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely static import/export statements",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements and an __all__ declaration. It does not process data, handle inputs, or execute logic. All reports correctly identify its benign, straightforward nature. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup for exporting classes, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The current scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
