  "purpose": "Build helpers for C++11+ projects using pybind11, managing compiler flags, environment variables, and parallel compilation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS), pybind11 import, filesystem (creating temp files), compiler objects.",
  "sinks": "Modifies compiler flags, build extension behavior, and compiler compile methods.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence compiler flags and thread count; dummy compile checks for feature support; modifies build extension methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or network activity; minor typo in function name ('no_recompile') but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured build utility for pybind11 C++ extensions. It detects compiler support, manages build flags based on environment variables, and supports parallel compilation. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The environment variable usage and dummy compile checks are typical in build systems. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build helper module, with no malware or malicious behavior. It performs common build configuration tasks safely. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is appropriate given its purpose and standard practices.",
