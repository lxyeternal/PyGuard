  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to determine directory paths for pybind11 include files, CMake modules, and pkgconfig files based on the current file location.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.path.dirname, os.path.join, os.path.exists",
  "sinks": "None that directly process untrusted input or data; primarily filesystem path checks and returns",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only computes and returns directory paths based on the current script location",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious file paths or hidden behaviors",
  "analysis": "The script determines directory paths based on the current file's location and checks for their existence. It raises ImportError if expected directories are missing, which is standard behavior for such utility functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code operates within expected norms for package setup utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended for locating dependencies' directories. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain risks. No security concerns are evident.",
