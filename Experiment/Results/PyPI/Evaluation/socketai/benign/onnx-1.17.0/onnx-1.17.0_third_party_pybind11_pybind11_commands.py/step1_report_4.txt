{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions to locate directories related to the pybind11 library, such as include, CMake, and pkgconfig directories.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file's directory via os.path.dirname(__file__) and checks for the existence of specific subdirectories (include, share/cmake/pybind11, share/pkgconfig).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data could leak or be exploited.",
  "flows": "The code flows from determining directory paths based on the current file's location and verifying their existence, raising exceptions if required directories are missing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. The code performs straightforward path operations and existence checks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the os module and defines functions that compute paths based on the current file's directory. It checks for directory existence before returning paths and raises errors if directories are missing, which is standard for setup utilities. No external input is read, and no data is transmitted or executed dynamically. The code is static, simple, and standard for locating library files.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and typical for setup or configuration scripts related to pybind11. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
