{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve directory paths related to the pybind11 package, such as include, CMake, and pkgconfig directories.",
  "sources": "Reads the current script directory (__file__) to determine paths; checks for existence of certain directories.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or external outputs; only filesystem checks and path returns.",
  "flows": "Uses the current directory to construct paths, then returns existing directory paths or raises errors if not found.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs straightforward filesystem path handling without obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code determines various pybind11-related directory paths based on the script's location, verifying their existence. It raises informative errors if expected directories are missing. The logic is simple, standard, and lacks any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for managing pybind11 directory paths. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security issues. It simply performs directory existence checks and returns paths accordingly.",
