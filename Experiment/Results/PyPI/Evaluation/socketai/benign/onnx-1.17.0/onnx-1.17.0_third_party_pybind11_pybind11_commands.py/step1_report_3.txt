  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve directory paths related to the pybind11 package, including include, CMake, and pkgconfig directories.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.path.dirname, os.path.join, os.path.exists",
  "targets": "None directly, as the code only constructs and checks file paths without executing or reading external data",
  "flows": "Constructed paths are checked for existence; no untrusted data input or external commands are executed",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple path retrieval functions based on the current file location. It performs directory existence checks and raises errors if expected directories are missing. No dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, network communication, or obfuscated code is present. The functions rely solely on the filesystem structure and standard library functions to locate package-related directories. There are no indications of malicious intent or malicious behavior.\n\nThe code appears to serve as a utility module for build or configuration scripts related to pybind11. It does not interact with external inputs beyond filesystem checks, and there are no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for path management related to pybind11, with no malicious behavior or security issues detected.",
