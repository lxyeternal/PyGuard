{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to retrieve directory paths related to the pybind11 package, such as include, CMake, and pkgconfig directories.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current file's directory (__file__), and checks for the existence of specific paths (include, share/cmake/pybind11, share/pkgconfig).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input data is processed or used in ways that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The functions generate paths based on the script's directory and check for their existence, raising errors if not found.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code structures are present. The code is straightforward and relies solely on filesystem checks.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically constructs directory paths based on the script location and verifies their existence. It raises informative exceptions if expected directories are missing. There is no usage of untrusted input, no network activity, or any execution of external commands. The functions are read-only concerning filesystem access and do not manipulate or expose sensitive data. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for locating package-related directories, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use and does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities.",
