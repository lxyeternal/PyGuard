  "sources": "Filesystem path checks using os.path.join and os.path.exists, based on __file__ directory.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, external commands, or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "Functions determine paths from the current file directory, check existence, and return paths or raise errors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward directory path resolution with existence validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility module that locates specific dependency directories by constructing paths relative to the current script location and verifying their existence. It raises informative errors if directories are missing. It does not process untrusted input, execute external commands, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The logic is standard and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard filesystem checks for dependency directories. There are no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation present. All reports correctly identify it as a safe utility module, and the assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate.",
