  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, open-source protobuf-to-mypy stub generator with no malicious behavior or security risks. All indicators point to benign code intended for type hinting support. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard dependency handling. The existing reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate."
