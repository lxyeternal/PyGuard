  "purpose": "Fetches closed GitHub issues labeled 'needs changelog', extracts changelog entries using regex, categorizes, and displays them formatted with rich.",
  "sources": "GitHub API issues endpoint, issue body text, issue HTML URL, issue title.",
  "sinks": "Terminal output via rich library.",
  "flows": "API data retrieval -> regex parsing -> categorization -> formatted terminal display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs read-only API calls to fetch issues, parses changelog entries with regex, categorizes issues based on title prefixes, and displays formatted output. No external network connections beyond API calls, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior observed. The use of static repository parameters is standard. The regex and processing logic are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for managing changelog entries from GitHub issues. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
