All indicators point to benign code intended for type hinting support. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2), reflecting standard dependency handling. The existing reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard build and packaging script for a Python extension module, performing version verification, file generation, and invoking CMake. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The use of dynamic execution and environment variables introduces moderate risk but is typical in such scripts. The overall security assessment is low risk, with no signs of malicious intent."
