  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential security implications, and the consistency of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard build script gathering version info via `git rev-parse`, reading `VERSION_NUMBER`, and invoking `cmake`.\n- **Sinks:** Subprocess calls to `git` and `cmake`, file writes for `version.py`.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Typical build process; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. Uses subprocess for version info and build commands, which is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The script performs legitimate build tasks. No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build setup, with environment variables controlling build options, subprocess for `git` and `cmake`.\n- **Sinks:** External commands, file operations, environment variables.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Use of subprocess is typical; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code. Environment variables influence build configuration.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard build script, no malicious activity. The low security risk score aligns with this.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (very low, considering minimal environment manipulation)\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The risk score is appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Build setup, version info via `git`, environment variables.\n- **Sinks:** Calls to `git`, `cmake`, file writes.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation. Standard build process.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, low security risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Scores match the analysis. No modifications necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar build orchestration, environment variables, subprocess calls.\n- **Sinks:** External commands, file operations.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious behavior; subprocess calls are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate build script, low risk.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (still very low, considering standard build procedures)\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Build configuration, version info via `git`, environment variables.\n- **Sinks:** Subprocess calls, file writes, directory changes.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate build script, no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variations (0.0 to 0.2) are justified by the use of subprocess calls to external tools, but these are standard in build scripts.\n\n**My own estimate after review:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low; typical build script behavior)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the assigned scores are reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, legitimate build and packaging script with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns.",
