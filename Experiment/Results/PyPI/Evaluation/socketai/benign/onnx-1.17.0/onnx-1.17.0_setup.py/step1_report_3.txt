{
  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for building and installing the ONNX Python package, including compiling CMake extensions, generating version files, and managing build options.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., ONNX_PREVIEW_BUILD, ONNX_ML, ONNX_VERIFY_PROTO3), git command output for version info, and file I/O for version.py and version number.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls to 'git' and 'cmake', file writing operations for version.py, and execution of build commands.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and subprocess outputs influence build configurations; subprocess commands execute external tools; file write operations create version info; build commands compile extensions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; use of standard build and versioning procedures; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads detected. The code only performs build setup and version management functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles build configuration, versioning, and extension compilation for the ONNX package. It uses environment variables for customizable build options, subprocess calls for retrieving version info and invoking build tools, and file operations for generating version data. There are no indications of malicious activity, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All subprocess calls and file manipulations are typical for a build script. No obfuscation or suspicious logic was identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build setup script for the ONNX package, with no signs of malicious behavior. It performs legitimate tasks related to versioning, environment configuration, and extension compilation. The risk score is very low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
