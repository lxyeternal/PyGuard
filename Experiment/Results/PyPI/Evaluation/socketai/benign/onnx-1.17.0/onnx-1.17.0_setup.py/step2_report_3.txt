  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a setup and build script for the ONNX Python package, involving version management, CMake integration, and environment configuration.\n- It uses subprocess calls to 'git' and 'cmake', which are standard in build scripts.\n- No hardcoded credentials, network communications, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The subprocess calls are confined to version retrieval and build configuration, with no indication of malicious activity.\n- The code performs typical build tasks: generating version files, configuring build options, compiling extensions, and copying build artifacts.\n- No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Build configuration for ONNX, version info, subprocess for 'git' and 'cmake'.\n- Findings: No malicious activity; subprocess calls are standard; no obfuscation.\n- **Malware score: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Security risk: 0** — justified.\n- **Confidence: 1** — high.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Setup script for building and configuring ONNX, subprocess for 'git' and 'cmake'.\n- Findings: Standard build procedures; subprocess calls are typical; no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Security risk: 0.1** — low, considering the use of subprocess; still benign.\n- **Confidence: 0.9** — high.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Build setup, version management, extension compilation.\n- Findings: No suspicious behavior; subprocess calls are typical; no secrets or backdoors.\n- **Malware score: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Security risk: 0** — justified.\n- **Confidence: 1** — high.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Build configuration, versioning, integration with CMake.\n- Findings: Standard build script; subprocess calls are confined to 'git' and 'cmake'; no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Security risk: 0.2** — very low, considering subprocess usage.\n- **Confidence: 0.9** — high.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Build setup, versioning, CMake integration.\n- Findings: Typical build script; subprocess calls for version info; no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score: 0** — appropriate.\n- **Security risk: 0** — justified.\n- **Confidence: 1** — high.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. The code does not perform any malicious actions, network activity, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the script (build and setup), the risk is inherently low. All reports assign very low scores, which are appropriate.\n\n### **Final expert assessment:**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for subprocess calls, but still negligible)\n\n**Justification:**\n- The script is a standard build configuration, not an attack vector.\n- No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.\n- The subprocess calls are typical for build scripts and do not indicate malicious intent.\n- Environment variables and file operations are used legitimately for build management.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThis supply chain report correctly identifies the code as a benign build script with no malicious activity. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the code's behavior.",
