{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for building and configuring the ONNX Python package, including compilation of C++ extensions via CMake, version management, and build environment setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for build configuration, subprocess calls for git revision, reading VERSION_NUMBER file, and command-line arguments for CMake.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess execution for git and CMake commands, file operations for version info, environment variables used for build configuration, and directory manipulations.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and subprocess outputs influence build parameters and version info; subprocess calls invoke external build tools; version and build info are written to files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess to execute git commands and CMake configuration, which is standard for build scripts but can be misused if environment is compromised; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity; no obfuscated code, misleading variable names, or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily manages the build process for the ONNX package, extracting version info from git and a VERSION_NUMBER file, configuring build parameters via environment variables, and executing external tools like CMake and git. The subprocess calls are typical for build systems and do not appear malicious. The environment variables control build configurations, not user input. File operations create version files and copy built extensions. No hardcoded secrets, network communications, or hidden behaviors are present. The overall logic aligns with standard build procedures, and the code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard build and setup script for the ONNX package. It handles versioning, environment configuration, and compilation without any signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not perform any suspicious activities or data exfiltration. The overall security risk is low.",
