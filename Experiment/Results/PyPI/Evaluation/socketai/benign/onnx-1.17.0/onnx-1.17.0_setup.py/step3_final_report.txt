  "purpose": "Build configuration and version management for the ONNX Python package, involving subprocess calls to 'git' and 'cmake', environment variable controls, and build orchestration.",
  "sources": "Subprocess calls to 'git' and 'cmake', environment variables for build options, file reads for version info.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external commands ('git', 'cmake'), creation of version files, copying build artifacts.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (environment variables, subprocess outputs) lead to build configuration and file generation, culminating in build artifacts.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity detected. Use of subprocess is standard for build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build setup tasks: retrieving version info via subprocess, configuring build options based on environment variables, invoking 'cmake' for compilation, and copying build artifacts. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess calls are typical in build systems and do not indicate malicious intent. The environment variables control build features but do not pose security risks. Overall, the script is a legitimate build process with low security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign build and packaging script for ONNX with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is appropriately very low (~0.0 to 0.1).",
