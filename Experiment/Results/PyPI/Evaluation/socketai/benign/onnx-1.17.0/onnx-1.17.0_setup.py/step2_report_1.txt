  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's actual behavior, potential security implications, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a build script for ONNX, involving version management, subprocess calls to 'git' and 'cmake', and build orchestration.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation. Uses standard tools and practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's behavior. No issues.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard build procedures with subprocess calls and environment variables.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity; subprocess calls are typical. Slightly cautious about subprocess use but justified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated risk score (0.1) is reasonable given the subprocess calls, but no malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No change necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a build script managing versioning and build configuration.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity; standard build steps.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar build orchestration with subprocess calls, environment variables, and version management.\n- **Findings:** No malicious intent; subprocess calls are typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) reflects cautiousness about subprocess use, which is justified but not indicative of malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, standard build setup.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2) are reasonable, reflecting cautiousness about subprocess calls and environment variable usage, but none suggest actual security risks.\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear, no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (small risk due to subprocess calls, but standard for build scripts)\n\nThis aligns with the overall understanding that this is a typical, legitimate build script with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe provided reports are accurate and reasonable. No modifications are necessary. The code is a standard build setup with no malicious or obfuscated behavior, and the risk scores appropriately reflect the cautious but justified concerns about subprocess usage.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- Keep the malware and obfuscated scores at 0.  \n- Set the risk score around 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting standard build script caution.",
