  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard build script activities—using environment variables, subprocess calls to 'git' and 'cmake', file reads/writes.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious flows; subprocess calls are typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The script functions as a legitimate build process. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The high confidence (1) is justified.\n\n**Assessment:** This is a straightforward, benign build script.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—standard build setup, versioning, invoking external tools.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious behaviors; subprocesses are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; low security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (very low). Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Also appears legitimate. Slightly higher risk score perhaps due to the general nature of subprocess calls, but still very low.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard build and version management.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; subprocess calls are typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The confidence is high (1).\n\n**Assessment:** Legitimate build script, no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous reports—build configuration, versioning, subprocess calls.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity; subprocesses involve 'git' and 'cmake' only.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard build process; no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (still very low). Confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Legitimate, with a slightly higher risk score perhaps due to the environment variable usage.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Build configuration, versioning, subprocess calls.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior; subprocesses are standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected; standard build script.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.0. Confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully legitimate build script.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports describe code that performs standard build, versioning, and packaging tasks using common tools like subprocess, git, and cmake.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Potential Risks:** Slightly elevated risk scores in some reports are due to the inherent risks of subprocess calls and environment variable manipulation, but these are standard in build scripts and do not imply malicious intent.\n- **Security Concerns:** No signs of data exfiltration, network communication, credential theft, or other malicious activities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** Given the analysis, the malware score should remain at **0** across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate no obfuscation; thus, **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** The overall risk is very low. Even with environmental variables and subprocess calls, these are typical in build scripts. I would assign a **risk score of 0** for all reports, or at most 0.1 if slight caution is warranted.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that these are standard build scripts with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a legitimate build and packaging script for the ONNX project, performing version management and build orchestration without any indications of malicious activity or security risks. The scores should reflect this, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and risk scores at 0.",
