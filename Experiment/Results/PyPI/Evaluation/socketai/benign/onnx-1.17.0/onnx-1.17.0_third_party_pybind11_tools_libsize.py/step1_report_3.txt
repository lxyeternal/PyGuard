{
  "purpose": "The script calculates the size of a specified shared object (.so) file and optionally compares it to a previously saved size, then updates the saved size for future comparisons.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments for file path and save file; checks existence of files; reads previous size from save file",
  "sinks": "Reads from filesystem (os.path.exists, os.path.getsize, open for reading/writing); outputs to stdout",
  "flows": "Command-line args -> File existence check -> File size retrieval -> (if save exists) read old size -> compare sizes -> output -> write new size to save file",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behavior. The script performs simple file size tracking without any obfuscated or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward filesystem operations: verifying arguments, checking file existence, obtaining file size, reading and writing a simple numeric value to a save file. No external network communication, no data exfiltration, and no dynamic code execution. It is an internal utility script designed for debugging or monitoring file size changes. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a benign utility for tracking the size of a specific file between runs. It does not contain malware or security risks, nor does it perform any suspicious activity. It is safe to use.",
