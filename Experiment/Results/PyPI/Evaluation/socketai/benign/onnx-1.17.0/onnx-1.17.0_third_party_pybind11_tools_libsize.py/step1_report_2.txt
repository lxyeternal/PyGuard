{
  "purpose": "This script calculates and tracks the size of a specified shared object (.so) file, primarily for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the command-line arguments (sys.argv) for the file path and save file name, and checks for the existence of the file and save file. It also reads the previous size from the save file.",
  "sinks": "The code writes the current file size to the save file.",
  "flows": "Input: sys.argv -> os.path.exists and os.path.getsize; Read from save file -> write to save file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The script performs straightforward file size tracking.",
  "analysis": "The script verifies input arguments, checks for file existence, obtains file size, compares it with a previous size stored in a text file, and updates this file accordingly. All operations are standard file handling and size retrieval. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The script is a simple utility for debugging or monitoring file size changes without any suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for tracking the size of a shared object file. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It only reads and writes local files for debugging purposes.",
