{
  "purpose": "The script calculates and compares the size of a specified shared object (.so) file, likely for debugging or verification purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), checks file existence (os.path.exists), and reads from a file (open, readline).",
  "sinks": "Writing the new size to save.txt (open, write), outputting information to stdout (print).",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> File existence check -> File size measurement -> Optional comparison with previous size read from save.txt -> Output -> Update save.txt with new size.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated segments. The script performs straightforward file size comparison without any suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script verifies input arguments, checks for file existence, and reads the size of the specified .so file. It optionally compares this size with a previous value stored in save.txt, then updates save.txt with the current size. No untrusted data is used in unsafe operations, no external network calls, and no suspicious code behaviors are present. The code functions solely for local file size monitoring and comparison, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign internal build utility that compares file sizes for debugging purposes. It does not contain malware or security risks, and no malicious behaviors are evident.",
