{
  "purpose": "A script for measuring and tracking the size of a specified shared object (.so) file, primarily for debugging or build verification purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), checks for file existence (os.path.exists), reads from a file (open), gets file size (os.path.getsize).",
  "sinks": "Writes the file size to a file (open with write mode).",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> file existence check -> file size measurement -> reading previous size from save file -> calculating change -> overwriting save file with new size.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No unusual code constructs. Use of straightforward file I/O and size calculations. No external network connections or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The script validates input arguments, checks for the existence of the specified file, measures its size, compares it to a stored previous size if available, and updates the stored size. All operations are local file and system interactions with no network activity or suspicious behaviors. The code performs simple size tracking for debugging purposes. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for tracking file size changes during build or debugging processes. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
