  "purpose": "A utility script to measure the size of a specified shared object file (.so), compare it with a previous size stored in a text file, and update the stored size for future comparisons.",
  "sources": "Reads the target file's existence and size; reads previous size from save.txt if it exists.",
  "sinks": "Reads file existence and size; writes updated size to save.txt.",
  "flows": "File existence check -> get size -> compare with previous size from save.txt -> output change -> update save.txt with current size.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; straightforward file operations with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple file existence checks, retrieves file size, compares it with a stored previous size, and updates the stored size. It contains no network activity, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code. The logic is clear and benign, serving as a debugging utility. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk mostly 0 or 0.1) are appropriate; the slight elevation in securityRisk in some reports is marginal and can be considered conservative. Overall, the script is safe and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward utility for tracking file size changes. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores should be malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, securityRisk=0.0 for consistency and accuracy.",
