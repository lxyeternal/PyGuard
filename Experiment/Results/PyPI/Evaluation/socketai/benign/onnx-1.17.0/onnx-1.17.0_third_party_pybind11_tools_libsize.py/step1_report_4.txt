  "purpose": "The script calculates and compares the size of a specified shared object (.so) file, likely for debugging or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Input arguments: sys.argv[1] (file path), sys.argv[2] (save filename).",
  "sinks": "File reading and writing: reading from the save file and writing the new size to it.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> file existence and size checks -> reading previous size from save file -> outputting size differences -> updating save file with current size.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code. The script performs straightforward file size operations without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts a filename and a save file, checks if the file exists, retrieves its size, compares it to a previously saved size if available, and updates the save file with the current size. It performs simple I/O operations with no network activity, no code injection, and no suspicious behavior. The script is clearly intended for debugging or testing file size changes. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign debugging utility with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It only performs file size comparisons and updates a local save file. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.",
