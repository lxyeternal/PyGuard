  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build and packaging script for a Python extension module, performing version verification, file generation, and invoking CMake. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The use of dynamic execution and environment variables introduces moderate risk but is typical in such scripts. The overall security assessment is low risk, with no signs of malicious intent."
