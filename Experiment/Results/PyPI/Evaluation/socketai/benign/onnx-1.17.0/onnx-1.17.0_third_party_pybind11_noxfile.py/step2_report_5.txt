  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard nox automation script for build, test, lint, docs, changelog, and packaging tasks. No suspicious activity, secrets, or malicious code detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is standard and benign. The minimal security risk score (0.1) is reasonable, given that the script executes external commands but doesn't process untrusted data or contain vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard practices, no suspicious code, and no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the reasoning aligns with the code's behavior. Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.2) is acceptable, considering the use of environment variables and subprocess calls, but nothing malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script automates typical development tasks with no signs of malicious activity. Uses environment variables and external commands in a standard way.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is consistent with the code's behavior. No suspicious flows or data leaks. The security risk is minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard automation with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. Uses session arguments and environment variables normally.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is accurate. The code is straightforward, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script automates development workflows, with no signs of malicious activity or suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is consistent with the code. The small security risk accounts for potential misconfiguration or environment issues, but nothing malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation, but all are low (0.1-0.2), which is reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the standard nature of the code, I would assign a **risk score of about 0.1** overall, as there's minimal inherent risk but some dependence on external commands and environment variables.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n**The reports are accurate and consistent with the code.** They correctly identify that this is a typical automation script with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores reflect the low risk and benign nature appropriately.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the overall assessment that the code is safe, standard, and free from malicious or suspicious behavior.",
