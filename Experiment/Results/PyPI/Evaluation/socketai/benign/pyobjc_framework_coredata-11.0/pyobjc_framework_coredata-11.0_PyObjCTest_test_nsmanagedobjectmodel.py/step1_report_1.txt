  "purpose": "Unit tests for the CoreData framework's NSManagedObjectModel class methods, verifying OS level support and method behavior.",
  "sources": "Imported modules CoreData and PyObjCTools.TestSupport; no data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code calls method assertions without handling untrusted data or performing output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; test assertions verify method properties internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or suspicious function calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test class with methods to check specific OS-level support functions in CoreData's NSManagedObjectModel. It uses decorators to specify minimum OS versions and calls assertion methods to verify method signatures and behavior. The code strictly tests framework methods and does not process external data or perform network or system modifications. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward unit test suite verifying framework method compatibility across OS versions. There are no indicators of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks within this code.",
