  "purpose": "Unit tests verifying method support and behaviors of NSManagedObjectModel across macOS versions.",
  "sources": "Method calls within the test methods, decorators indicating OS version requirements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no external data handling, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Test method invocation -> method signature assertions; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test suite for system API methods, using decorators for OS version support and assertions to verify method signatures. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or manipulate files. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, purpose-specific nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard unit test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores should be maintained at zero for malware and obfuscation, and at zero for security risk, reflecting its benign and controlled purpose.",
