{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for packaging the pyobjc-framework-CoreData Python extension, primarily for building and installing the framework bindings for macOS's Core Data system.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ attribute to determine directory, listing files in the Modules directory, and importing setup, Extension from pyobjc_setup.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input; the code primarily handles package setup and file listing.",
  "flows": "The code reads the current file path, lists module files in the 'Modules' directory, and passes them to the Extension constructor for compilation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is standard for a setup script, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a specific setup utility from pyobjc_setup. It modifies sys.path to include the current directory, then configures a Python extension module for the CoreData framework. It dynamically lists files in the Modules directory to set dependencies, which is typical for build scripts. No code execution from untrusted sources, no network activity, nor any hidden or malicious behaviors are present. The script's purpose is to facilitate packaging and building the framework bindings.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate setup script for packaging the pyobjc-framework-CoreData module. It contains no malicious code, no suspicious behaviors, and no obfuscated patterns. It is safe and aligned with standard packaging practices.",
