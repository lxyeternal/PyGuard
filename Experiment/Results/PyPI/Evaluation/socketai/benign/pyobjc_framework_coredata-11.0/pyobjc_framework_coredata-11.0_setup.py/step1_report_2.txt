{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing the pyobjc-framework-CoreData Python package, which provides wrappers for the CoreData framework on macOS.",
  "sources": "Reading the __file__ variable for directory path, listing files in the 'Modules' directory to determine dependencies, and static strings for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "The setup function and Extension configuration do not execute any untrusted data; they are used for package installation and building.",
  "flows": "N/A — the script does not process untrusted input or data; it mainly configures package build parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules os and sys, modifies sys.path for module resolution, and defines package setup parameters. It dynamically lists files in the 'Modules' directory to include as dependencies, which is a common pattern in setup scripts. All operations are static configuration and file listing without any data processing, user input handling, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears to serve purely as a build configuration for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It merely prepares the package for distribution, with no suspicious behaviors or malware detected.",
