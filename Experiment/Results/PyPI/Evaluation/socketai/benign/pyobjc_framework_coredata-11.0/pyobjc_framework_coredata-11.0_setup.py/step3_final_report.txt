{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging the 'pyobjc-framework-CoreData' extension module on macOS, configuring build parameters and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Filesystem listing of 'Modules' directory, current file path (__file__), and static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external code execution points.",
  "flows": "Reads module files from 'Modules' directory to determine dependencies; passes configuration to setup() for building extension.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors; standard setup pattern.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: importing modules, adjusting sys.path, listing files for dependencies, and configuring extension modules. It does not execute untrusted code, connect to networks, or process external input. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is effectively 0, aligning with its benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard setup script for packaging a Python extension module wrapping macOS's CoreData framework. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and benign nature.",
