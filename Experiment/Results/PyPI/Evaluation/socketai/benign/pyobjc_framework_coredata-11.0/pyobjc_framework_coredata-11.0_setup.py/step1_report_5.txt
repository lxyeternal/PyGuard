{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for building and installing the pyobjc-framework-CoreData package, which provides Python bindings for the macOS Core Data framework.",
  "sources": "Reads the current directory to list modules in 'Modules' folder; imports os, sys, and pyobjc_setup for setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the script mainly performs package setup without executing untrusted data or external commands.",
  "flows": "The script gathers module dependencies from the filesystem and passes them to the setup function without any data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior. The code performs standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with a descriptive comment about the framework, then imports necessary modules. It modifies sys.path to include the current directory, then proceeds to define package setup parameters, including dynamically listing modules in the 'Modules' directory. No user input, network activity, or insecure operations are present. The code is straightforward, serving only to configure package build and installation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python extension package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily performs filesystem operations and package configuration, with no evidence of malicious intent or dangerous behavior.",
