{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the CoreData framework's CoreSpotlight delegate functionality in macOS/iOS.",
  "sources": "Imports CoreData module, reads constants, method signatures, and attributes related to Spotlight delegate.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could leak information.",
  "flows": "Code inspects attributes and method signatures; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs assertions to verify method signatures, constants, and availability based on OS level. It uses decorators to check OS version compatibility. The code appears to be part of a test suite rather than production code with data processing or external interactions. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test suite validating the presence and signatures of certain methods and constants related to CoreSpotlight delegate in the CoreData framework. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
