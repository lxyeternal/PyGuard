  "purpose": "Unit tests for CoreData's NSCoreDataCoreSpotlightDelegate functionalities, primarily for macOS/iOS system APIs.",
  "sources": "Imported modules CoreData and PyObjCTools.TestSupport, no data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only performs assertions and checks on existing system API constants and methods.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only verifies API attributes and methods.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. No system calls or data exfiltration present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying the presence and properties of system APIs related to CoreData and Spotlight delegation. It utilizes decorators for OS version checks and performs assertions on constants and method signatures. No input/output, network activity, or data manipulation is involved. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code segments. The code appears to be standard testing code for API validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of unit tests for system API methods and constants related to CoreData and Spotlight, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
