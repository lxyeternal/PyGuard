{
  "purpose": "The script sets up, configures, and manages the build and testing process for the PyObjC framework wrappers, including handling dependencies, SDK detection, and testing procedures.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., PATH, CFLAGS, SDK settings), invokes subprocesses for system commands (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), reads files (PKG-INFO, SDKSettings.plist, headers), and imports modules dynamically.",
  "sinks": "Uses subprocess for system commands; reads files that may contain version or SDK info; dynamically imports modules for testing; writes build info to a file.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and system commands provide SDK/version info -> system info used in build flags and setup configuration -> dynamic module import and test suite creation from files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard Python and setuptools modules. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution found. Potential concern: dynamic import of modules with arbitrary paths, but this is standard for test discovery.",
  "analysis": "The code performs system calls to gather system and SDK information, modifies build configurations, and dynamically imports test modules. It manages build environment settings, compiles code with platform-specific flags, and prepares testing suites. All actions are consistent with build automation and testing procedures, with no suspicious behavior. No network connections, data leaks, or malicious commands are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup and build management tool for PyObjC. It handles environment detection, build configuration, and testing in a typical manner without any indication of malicious intent or sabotage.",
