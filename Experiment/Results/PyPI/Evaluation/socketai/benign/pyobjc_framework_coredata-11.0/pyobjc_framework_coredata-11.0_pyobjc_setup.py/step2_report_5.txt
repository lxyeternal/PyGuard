  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and overall security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Describes standard build setup, gathering system info, environment variables, subprocess outputs, and file reads.\n- **Sinks & Flows**: No network activity; data flows are typical for build scripts.\n- **Anomalies**: No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious dynamic code.\n- **Analysis**: All operations are typical for a build system—collecting SDK info, configuring build flags, running tests, and writing build info files.\n- **Conclusion**: No malicious intent detected; standard build script.\n\n**Scores**:  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0 (appropriate)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on environment detection and test setup.\n- **Anomalies**: No suspicious code, credentials, or obfuscation. Dynamic module import is standard for test discovery.\n- **Analysis**: All system calls and environment manipulations are typical for a build/test script.\n- **Conclusion**: No malicious behavior; legitimate build/test process.\n\n**Scores**:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (slightly elevated but justified due to environment complexity; still low)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Similar build and test setup with system info gathering.\n- **Anomalies**: No suspicious code, no obfuscated logic, no network activity.\n- **Analysis**: All subprocess calls are for environment detection; dynamic import is standard.\n- **Conclusion**: Legitimate build script, no malware.\n\n**Scores**:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (justified, but low)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Again, build and test configuration with system info gathering.\n- **Anomalies**: No malicious patterns, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis**: Standard practices for build automation; no suspicious network or data exfiltration.\n- **Conclusion**: Legitimate, typical build script.\n\n**Scores**:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources**: Similar to others, system info, environment setup, dynamic module loading.\n- **Anomalies**: No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis**: All operations are standard for build scripts.\n- **Conclusion**: No malicious intent detected.\n\n**Scores**:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: All reports correctly assign 0; no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- **Risk Score**: Slightly elevated at 0.1 for some reports due to complexity and system interactions, but overall very low.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware**: 0 — the code is standard build and test infrastructure.\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 — no obfuscation techniques detected.\n- **Risk**: 0.05 — very low, given the nature of the code; it’s a typical build setup script.\n\n**Conclusion**: The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a legitimate build/test script with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified, and no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes**: Always remain vigilant for subtle signs, but in this case, the evidence strongly indicates a safe, standard build setup process.",
