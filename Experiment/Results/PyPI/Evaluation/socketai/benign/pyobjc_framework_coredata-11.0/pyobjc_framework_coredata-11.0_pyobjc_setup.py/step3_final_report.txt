{
  "purpose": "The code manages build configuration, environment detection, SDK info gathering, and test execution routines for the PyObjC framework, primarily involving subprocess calls, file reads, and dynamic module imports.",
  "sources": "System commands (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), plist files, environment variables, and dynamic import of test modules.",
  "sinks": "No network activity, no data exfiltration, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code.",
  "flows": "System info commands feed into build flags and SDK version detection; dynamic test module imports load code from local files; sys.path modifications facilitate test discovery.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; code is straightforward, with standard practices for build and test setup.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment detection, SDK version retrieval, build flag configuration, and test suite management. It uses subprocess for system info, reads plist files for SDK details, modifies sys.path for test discovery, and dynamically loads test modules. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious logic are present. The code is typical for build automation scripts, with clear structure and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate, standard build and test setup script for the PyObjC project. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The low security risk score (0.1) is justified by environment interactions but does not indicate any threat.",
