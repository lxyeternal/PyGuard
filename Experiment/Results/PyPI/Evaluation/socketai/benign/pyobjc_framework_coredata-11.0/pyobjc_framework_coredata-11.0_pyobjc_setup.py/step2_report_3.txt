  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the logic, and the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the script manages build info, SDK detection, and test execution.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activities, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** The code's use of subprocess to gather system info and sys.path modifications for testing are standard practices.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that this is a legitimate build script with no malware is consistent and justified.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (no obfuscation)  \n- Risk: 0 (no security risk)  \n\n**Verdict:** The report's assessment appears accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The script's focus on SDK detection, environment setup, and test management is correctly identified.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The dynamic module import for tests is standard.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** System calls for system info are typical. The only potential concern is dynamic import, but it's limited to local test files.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that this is a legitimate build and test script holds.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (slightly above zero, possibly due to environment manipulation, but not malicious)  \n\n**Verdict:** The security risk score could be lowered to 0, as no actual risk is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, focusing on build configuration, environment detection, and testing.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no malicious code.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Use of subprocess for system info is standard; no network activity or secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Validates the script as a typical setup script.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (again, a minor note but no real risk)  \n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed; the assessment aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Recognizes the script's role in setup, build, and testing.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. Use of subprocess for system info is standard.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** No suspicious network or data exfiltration.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states this is a legitimate build/test script.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (again, very minor, but no real security concern)  \n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar overview, focusing on environment detection, build, and tests.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** System info gathering and dynamic module import are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies this as a normal build script.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (minimal, but not significant)  \n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, no obfuscation observed.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in all reports, which might reflect the dynamic import and system info gathering, but these are standard in build scripts and do not constitute a security risk.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the detailed review, **none of the reports indicate actual malicious intent or suspicious behavior**. The code is a comprehensive, standard build and test setup script for an open-source project, with system info gathering, environment configuration, and testing routines that are typical for such scripts.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk; minor environment manipulations are standard)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is legitimate, with no malware or malicious intent. The minor security risk scores could be lowered to zero, but their current values are acceptable given the context.",
