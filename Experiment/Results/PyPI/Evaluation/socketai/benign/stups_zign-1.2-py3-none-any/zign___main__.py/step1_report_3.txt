{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an entry point to invoke the main function from the zign.cli module, likely to run a CLI application.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'main' function from the 'zign.cli' module.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'main()' which may internally invoke further data processing; however, no direct sink such as network, file, or environment variable manipulation is present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Importing 'main' and executing 'main()' when '__name__' is '__main__'; data flows depend on the internal implementation of 'main()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be a minimal script to execute a CLI entry point.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from an external module and executes it conditionally if the script is run directly. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors in this snippet. The actual security risk depends entirely on the implementation of 'zign.cli.main', which is not provided here. The code structure is standard for CLI applications.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet is a typical CLI entry point with no inherent malicious behavior or security risks. Its security implications depend on the internal logic of 'zign.cli.main', which is not visible here.",
