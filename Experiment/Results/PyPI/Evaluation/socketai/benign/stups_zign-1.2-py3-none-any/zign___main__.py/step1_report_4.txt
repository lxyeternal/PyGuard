{
  "purpose": "The code is a minimal Python script that imports and executes a main function from the 'zign.cli' module, likely intended to run a command-line interface.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it only imports and calls a function from an external module.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'main()' from 'zign.cli', which could potentially execute further code that might be malicious depending on that module's implementation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from importing 'main' from 'zign.cli' to executing 'main()' when the script is run as the main program. Any further data flow depends on 'main()' implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The script itself is very simple, with no unusual or suspicious code constructs. The import path 'zign.cli' is a standard import, but the behavior depends entirely on the external module.",
  "analysis": "This code is a standard entry point pattern for a command-line application. It does not contain hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or other suspicious patterns. Its security risk depends on the content of 'zign.cli', which is not provided. No malicious behavior can be inferred from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward wrapper to execute 'zign.cli.main()' when run directly. It does not contain any evident malicious code or security issues on its own. The risk assessment depends on the behavior of the external module, which cannot be evaluated here.",
