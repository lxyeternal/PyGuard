  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal CLI entry point with no inherent malicious or suspicious elements. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the external implementation of zign.cli.main(). The assigned scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores are zero, and the risk score could be slightly lowered to 0.1 for maximal conservatism. Overall, the code itself is safe, and no immediate concerns are present."
