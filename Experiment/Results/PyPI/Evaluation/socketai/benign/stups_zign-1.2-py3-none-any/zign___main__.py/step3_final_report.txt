  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code present; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python CLI bootstrap that delegates execution to an external module. It contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of zign.cli.main(), which is not provided. The malware score is appropriately zero, indicating no malicious intent. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging external dependencies. Confidence in the benign nature of this snippet is high (above 0.9), but the overall security posture cannot be fully assessed without inspecting zign.cli.main().",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal CLI entry point with no inherent malicious or suspicious elements. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the external implementation of zign.cli.main(). The assigned scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores are zero, and the risk score could be slightly lowered to 0.1 for maximal conservatism. Overall, the code itself is safe, and no immediate concerns are present.",
