{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for executing the 'main' function from the 'zign.cli' module, likely initiating a command-line interface process.",
  "sources": "Importing 'main' from 'zign.cli', which may internally read configuration, environment variables, or user input when called.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'main()' may lead to various sinks depending on its implementation, such as network communication, file operations, or system commands; however, these are contained within the 'zign.cli' package and not explicitly shown here.",
  "flows": "Import 'main' -> Execute 'main()' when script runs -> Potential internal data flows within 'main', possibly involving user input or environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious constructs are evident. The import and function call are standard.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a main function from an external module and executes it if run as a script. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of 'zign.cli.main'. No malicious behavior can be inferred solely from this code snippet. It is a typical pattern for CLI entry points.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code, there is no indication of malicious behavior. The code is a simple entry point that delegates execution to an external module. Without inspecting 'zign.cli', no malicious activity or security risks can be confirmed.",
