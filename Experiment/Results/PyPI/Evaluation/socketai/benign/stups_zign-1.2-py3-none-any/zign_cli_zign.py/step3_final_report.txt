{
  "purpose": "This code implements a CLI tool for managing tokens, including listing, deleting, and creating tokens via external functions, with options for deprecated parameters and environment variable support.",
  "sources": "CLI command-line arguments, environment variables (ZIGN_USER, ZIGN_PASSWORD), external get_token() function",
  "sinks": "Printing access tokens directly to stdout",
  "flows": "Input options/env vars → get_token() → print(access_token)",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated options, printing sensitive tokens to stdout, reliance on external get_token() without internal security assessment",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. It invokes an external token retrieval function and prints the token, which could leak sensitive data if output is captured. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The deprecated options are a maintenance concern but do not introduce security vulnerabilities. The malware scores are zero, indicating no malicious intent. The security risk scores are low (~0.2-0.3), primarily due to token printing, which is a common pattern but warrants caution. The overall structure and behavior are benign, with no evidence of supply chain compromise or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and straightforward, with no malware or obfuscation detected. The main security consideration is the token output, which could lead to leakage if not handled securely. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the code's behavior.",
