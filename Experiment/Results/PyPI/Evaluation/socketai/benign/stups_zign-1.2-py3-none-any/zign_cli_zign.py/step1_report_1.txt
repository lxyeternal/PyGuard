  "purpose": "This source code defines command-line interface commands for managing tokens using the 'click' library, including listing, deleting, and creating tokens.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments, environment variables ('ZIGN_USER', 'ZIGN_PASSWORD'), and potentially deprecated options. Data is read from user input, environment variables, and function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the 'get_token' function invocation and 'print' of the access token, which may leak tokens if output is not handled securely.",
  "flows": "Input data from command-line arguments and environment variables flows into 'get_token' and 'print(access_token)'. Deprecated options are read but not used internally, so they do not affect flow unless passed explicitly. 'get_token' is the key function generating or retrieving tokens.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Use of deprecated options is noted, but they are not used in logic. The 'print' of access tokens could be a privacy concern if output isn't secured. No obfuscated or malicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard CLI patterns with 'click' and related libraries. It reads input from command-line options and environment variables. The main function invokes commands which in turn call 'get_token' to obtain tokens, then prints the tokens. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. Usage of deprecated options appears solely for backward compatibility. The token output is straightforward and not obfuscated, but printing tokens could pose a privacy risk if output is captured maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily an interface layer managing tokens with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The main security concern is the printing of tokens, which could lead to accidental leakage if output is captured or observed by unauthorized users. No malware or supply chain attacks are detected.",
