  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, focusing on the code's security implications, potential malware, obfuscation, and overall risk.\n\n**1. Presence of malicious or suspicious code:**\n- The code primarily sets up CLI commands for token management, invoking an external `get_token` function.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are evident.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code patterns are detected.\n- The `print(access_token)` output could be a privacy concern but isn't malicious.\n\n**2. Use of deprecated options:**\n- Multiple reports note deprecated options for backward compatibility.\n- These are not used internally and do not introduce vulnerabilities directly.\n- However, deprecated options can sometimes be misused if not properly handled, but in this context, they seem benign.\n\n**3. Handling of sensitive data:**\n- Environment variables `ZIGN_USER` and `ZIGN_PASSWORD` are used, which is good practice.\n- No hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The output of tokens is directly printed, which could be a leakage vector if output is captured maliciously, but not a malware indicator.\n\n**4. The `get_token` function:**\n- Its implementation is not provided.\n- All security concerns about token generation depend on its internal logic.\n- Since no malicious code is visible here, we cannot attribute malicious intent to this code fragment.\n\n**5. Malware and obfuscation scores:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0.\n- This aligns with the code's straightforward structure.\n\n**6. Risk scores:**\n- The reports assign low security risk scores (~0.2-0.3), primarily due to token printing and deprecated options.\n- These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**7. Consistency and justification:**\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No anomalies or assumptions suggest higher risk or malware.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — Code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2-0.3** — Low, mainly due to token output and deprecated options.\n\n### My own estimate:\nConsidering all factors, I would assign:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (mainly privacy concern with token printing, not a security breach)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard CLI wrapper for token management with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main concern is the potential leakage of tokens via output, which is a known risk but not malware. The scores from the reports are reasonable and align with this assessment.",
