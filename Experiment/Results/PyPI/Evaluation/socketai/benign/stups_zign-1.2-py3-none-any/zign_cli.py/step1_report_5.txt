  "purpose": "This script provides command-line interface (CLI) functionalities for managing OAuth tokens, including listing, deleting, and creating tokens using implicit flow authentication.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line options/arguments (e.g., token name, URLs, credentials), configuration files, and potentially environment variables (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Sensitive data sinks include printing access tokens to stdout, writing token data to YAML files, and network calls via get_token_implicit_flow (likely involving HTTP requests).",
  "flows": "Data flows from command-line input (source) into functions that may invoke network requests or file writes (sink). For example, token creation involves reading CLI parameters, making network requests (via get_token_implicit_flow), and outputting tokens or writing files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible. No obfuscated code, misleading variable names, or unusual code patterns. No evidence of malicious code like system manipulation or data exfiltration. External calls (get_token_implicit_flow) are abstracted; their security depends on implementation, but not directly malicious here.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages OAuth tokens through CLI commands, with standard input validation, configuration loading, and output formatting. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are apparent. Network requests are encapsulated in imported functions. The code handles tokens securely by printing only the access token and writing token data to YAML files. No signs of malware or malicious sabotage are detected. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or unusual code constructs. Security risks are minimal given the limited scope; the main concern is trusting the external function get_token_implicit_flow, which is not shown here but presumed to perform network authentication securely.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard CLI tool for token management with no indicators of malicious intent or malicious code. It manages sensitive data properly, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors. The overall security risk is low, assuming external functions are secure and correctly implemented.",
