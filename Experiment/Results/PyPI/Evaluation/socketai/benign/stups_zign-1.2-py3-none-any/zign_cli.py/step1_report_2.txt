{
  "purpose": "The script manages OAuth tokens, listing, deleting, and creating tokens through command-line commands, primarily for use with a platform's IAM.",
  "sources": "Data sources include environment/config files (loaded by stups_cli.config.load_config and yaml.safe_dump), user inputs (via command-line arguments), and external API calls (get_tokens, get_token_implicit_flow).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing token data back to disk (yaml.safe_dump), printing tokens and data to stdout, and making API calls to external endpoints.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input (command-line arguments, external API responses) flows into functions that generate tokens, list data, or delete tokens; token data flows from API responses and is stored or printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs observed. No suspicious dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or unusual variable usage. No signs of data exfiltration or malicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages OAuth tokens, performing file read/write, printing output, and calling API functions. It securely handles tokens without embedding secrets in code. The functions interact with external APIs and local storage but do not perform any suspicious or malicious actions. No suspicious network connections, data leaks, or malicious modifications detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a CLI tool for token management without indications of malicious intent. It securely handles token data and API interactions. No malicious or suspicious behavior observed. The overall security risk is minimal.",
