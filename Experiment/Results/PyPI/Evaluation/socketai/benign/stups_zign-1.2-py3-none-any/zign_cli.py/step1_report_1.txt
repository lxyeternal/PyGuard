{
  "purpose": "This script manages OAuth tokens via command-line commands, including listing, deleting, and creating tokens.",
  "sources": "The code reads user input via command-line options and arguments, and loads configuration and token data from files.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs tokens and data directly to the terminal, and writes token data to a YAML file.",
  "flows": "User inputs (CLI options) flow into functions that generate or delete tokens; token data is retrieved and stored, and tokens are printed or saved to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors are present. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution observed. Use of external libraries appears typical for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries and third-party packages to manage OAuth tokens via command-line interface. Functions handle token listing, deletion, and creation through external API calls, with token data stored in YAML files. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or backdoors. Input data is primarily from CLI parameters and files, and output is printed or saved. No insecure practices such as unsafe SQL, code injection, or environment variable misuse are evident. Overall, the code appears legitimate, focused on token management without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard CLI tool for managing OAuth tokens with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs legitimate token handling and file operations securely. No malicious or sabotage code detected.",
