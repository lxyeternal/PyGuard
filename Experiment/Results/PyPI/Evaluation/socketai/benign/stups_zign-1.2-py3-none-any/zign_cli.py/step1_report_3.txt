{
  "purpose": "This script manages OAuth tokens, including listing, deleting, and creating tokens via OAuth flows.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments, environment variables (indirectly via configuration), and external OAuth endpoints (authorize_url, token_url). Data read from token storage files (YAML).",
  "sinks": "Output sinks include printing tokens and token information to the console, writing token data back to a YAML file, and making network requests to OAuth endpoints for token retrieval.",
  "flows": "The flow involves receiving user inputs (command-line args), calling OAuth endpoints (authorize_url, token_url) to fetch tokens, storing/deleting tokens from a file, and displaying token info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. Use of standard libraries (click, yaml, time) appears benign. No suspicious code obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs token management and OAuth flow handling. It reads configuration and token data from files, interacts with external OAuth endpoints, and displays or deletes tokens. The OAuth tokens are handled securely by only printing or storing them without any suspicious transformations. No evidence of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network tunneling, or backdoors. The network interactions are standard OAuth procedures. No obfuscated code or malicious code injection is present. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate token management utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward OAuth token management CLI tool with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It interacts with OAuth endpoints, manages tokens, and displays or deletes them securely. No security risks identified based on this code fragment.",
