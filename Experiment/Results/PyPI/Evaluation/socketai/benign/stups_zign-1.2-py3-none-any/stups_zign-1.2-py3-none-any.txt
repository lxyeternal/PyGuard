      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal CLI entry point with no inherent malicious or suspicious elements. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the external implementation of zign.cli.main(). The assigned scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores are zero, and the risk score could be slightly lowered to 0.1 for maximal conservatism. Overall, the code itself is safe, and no immediate concerns are present."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign and straightforward, with no malware or obfuscation detected. The main security consideration is the token output, which could lead to leakage if not handled securely. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the code's behavior."
