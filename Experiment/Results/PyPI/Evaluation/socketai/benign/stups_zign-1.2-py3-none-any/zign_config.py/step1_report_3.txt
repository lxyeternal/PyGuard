  "purpose": "Define constants and file paths for a token management CLI application.",
  "sources": "click.get_app_dir() function call to determine configuration directory; hardcoded string constants for keys and filenames.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; constants are predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns; straightforward configuration setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and sets constants for configuration keys and filenames. It uses 'click.get_app_dir()' to determine the application directory, which is standard practice. No input validation, data processing, or network operations are present. No hardcoded secrets beyond static strings, and no dynamic or obfuscated code. The code appears to serve as configuration initialization for a CLI tool managing tokens.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup with no malicious behavior detected. It simply defines static constants and file paths for use elsewhere in the application.",
