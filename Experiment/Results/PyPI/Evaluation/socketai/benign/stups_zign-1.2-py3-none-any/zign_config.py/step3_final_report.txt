  "flows": "Retrieval of app directory -> construction of file paths",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static strings and standard library functions used appropriately",
  "analysis": "The code sets static constants for configuration directory and token file paths using trusted functions. No user input, environment variables, or external data are processed. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data leaks. The use of click.get_app_dir() is standard for application data storage. No dynamic execution or secret handling is present. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate a benign configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It simply defines file paths for token storage using trusted functions. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (0.1), reflecting the static configuration nature.",
