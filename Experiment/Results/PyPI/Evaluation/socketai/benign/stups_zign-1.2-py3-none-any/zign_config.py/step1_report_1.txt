  "sinks": "File path construction with os.path.join for tokens and refresh tokens",
  "flows": "click.get_app_dir() → os.path.join() to build file paths",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials beyond constant strings, no suspicious code execution or external calls, standard use of libraries",
  "analysis": "The code sets up configuration constants and determines file paths for token storage using the 'click' library to get application directories. There are no input sources like user input or environment variables read dynamically; only fixed string constants are used. The code constructs file paths for tokens.yaml and refresh-token.yaml within the app-specific directory. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are evident. It appears to be standard configuration setup code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup of configuration parameters and file paths for token management. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
