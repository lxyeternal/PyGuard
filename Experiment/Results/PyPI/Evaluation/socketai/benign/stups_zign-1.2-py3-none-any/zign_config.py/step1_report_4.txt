  "purpose": "Define constants and configuration paths for a CLI application managing tokens.",
  "sources": "click.get_app_dir() to determine config directory path; no other data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leak points detected in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Configuration directory path is derived from click.get_app_dir() and used to build file paths for tokens.yaml and refresh-token.yaml.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials beyond constant string values; no suspicious or unusual code behavior; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets static string constants for key and config names, then constructs file paths for token storage using click's application directory function and os.path.join. There are no input/output operations beyond path definitions, no data processing, no security-sensitive operations such as network connections, encryption, or credential handling beyond static strings. Overall, it appears to be a straightforward configuration setup without malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration setup for a CLI tool, defining file paths and constants with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
