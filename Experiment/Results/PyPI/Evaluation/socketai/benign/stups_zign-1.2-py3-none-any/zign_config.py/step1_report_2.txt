{
  "purpose": "Define constants and file paths for token management in a CLI application.",
  "sources": "click.get_app_dir(CONFIG_NAME) to determine configuration directory path; os.path.join to construct file paths.",
  "flows": "Retrieving app directory via click, then constructing file paths; no data flow from external inputs to sensitive locations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials beyond static strings; no suspicious code execution or data manipulation; standard library usage; no unusual or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code sets static string constants and constructs file paths using standard libraries and the click library. The use of click.get_app_dir suggests storing tokens in an OS-appropriate application directory. No input processing, data transmission, or execution of untrusted code is present. The static strings 'zign' and 'zalando-token-cli' are identifiers and not secrets, and are used for configuration directory naming. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be straightforward configuration setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It merely defines constants and file paths for token storage, with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
