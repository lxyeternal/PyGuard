  "purpose": "Define constants for configuration file paths and a key used in token management.",
  "sources": "click.get_app_dir() function to determine configuration directory; static string assignments for keys and filenames.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no data leaks or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply sets up file paths using trusted functions and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials or hidden functionalities.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes constants for application configuration, including directory and file paths for token storage, using the 'click' library's 'get_app_dir()' function. All operations involve static strings and trusted library calls without user input or untrusted data. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup of configuration parameters with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
