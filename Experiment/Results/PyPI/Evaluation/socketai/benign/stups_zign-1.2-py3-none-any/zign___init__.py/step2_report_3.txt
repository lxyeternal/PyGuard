  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external calls, and no suspicious constructs. The code is static and minimal.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code is benign, standard practice, and contains no malicious behavior. No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, no malicious activity is detected or implied.\n   - **Security Risk Score (0)**: Appropriate, as the code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n   The scores assigned align well with the analysis, which finds no issues.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports conclude that this code is benign and standard, there is no justification for higher risk scores. The code is simply a version placeholder, potentially replaced during build or release, which is common in software development.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis. There is no indication of malicious intent or activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid assumptions and are grounded in the code's simplicity. They recognize that the version string might be replaced during release, which is typical, not malicious.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are zero or one, reflecting benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct)\n- **Security Risk Score**: 0 (correct)\n\n### My own assessment:\n\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the reports' conclusions. The code is a standard version declaration, with no malicious or security concerns. The comment about replacement during release is typical and does not imply any malicious intent.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated**: 0  \n- **Risk**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the overall benign nature of the code.",
