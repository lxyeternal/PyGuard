  "purpose": "Defines the version string of a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string '1.2' to the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string value to a variable indicating version information. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external calls, and no suspicious patterns. The comment suggests that this version string may be dynamically replaced during the release process, which is common in software development workflows but not inherently malicious. The code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
