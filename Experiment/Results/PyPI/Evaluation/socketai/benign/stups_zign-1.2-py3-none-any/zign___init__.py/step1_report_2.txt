  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present, as the code does not process input or data.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the comment indicates the version is replaced during release, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string to __version__, which is a common practice in Python packages to indicate versioning. The comment suggests this line is replaced during the release process, likely by a build or deployment script. There are no sources of untrusted data, no data flows, and no suspicious operations present. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to declare the package version. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
