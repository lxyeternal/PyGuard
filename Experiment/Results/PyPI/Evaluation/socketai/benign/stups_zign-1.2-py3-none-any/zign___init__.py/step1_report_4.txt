  "purpose": "Defines the version string of the module or package.",
  "sources": "Assignment to __version__ from a string literal '1.2'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data sources or output.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and contains only a version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to the variable __version__, likely used for package versioning. It states that the version is replaced during the release process, implying it is a placeholder during development. No user input, environment variables, or external data is involved. The code is minimal and standard for version tracking in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard version assignment with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is a placeholder that is overwritten during the release process, indicating no malicious behavior or security risks.",
