  "purpose": "Define the package version string, likely replaced during release.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of the string '1.2' to __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external inputs or outputs involved.",
  "flows": "None; the code is static with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Comment indicates version is replaced during release; no malicious or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to __version__, with a comment suggesting dynamic replacement during release. No inputs, outputs, or external interactions are present. The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard in Python projects. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
