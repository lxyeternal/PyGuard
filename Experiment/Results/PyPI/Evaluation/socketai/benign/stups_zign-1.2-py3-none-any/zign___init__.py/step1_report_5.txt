  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string to the __version__ variable, which is standard practice for versioning. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. No external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors are present. The comment suggests this version is replaced during release, which is common in deployment workflows.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard version assignment statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
