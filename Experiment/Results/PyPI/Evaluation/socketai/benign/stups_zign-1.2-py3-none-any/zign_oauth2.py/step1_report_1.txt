{
  "purpose": "This code implements a local HTTP server to handle OAuth 2.0 redirect responses, extract access tokens from URL fragments, and display appropriate success or error pages.",
  "sources": "Reads the request URL path and query parameters from incoming GET requests.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes HTML pages containing JavaScript and user input back to the client. Also sets query parameters in server state.",
  "flows": "GET request URL → parse URL and query parameters → extract access_token → serve success or error page. JavaScript in EXTRACT_TOKEN_PAGE extracts token from URL fragment and redirects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. The JavaScript parses URL fragments client-side and redirects, which is standard for OAuth flows. The server stores query parameters but does not transmit them elsewhere. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity, or data exfiltration routines are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a minimal OAuth redirect handler. It listens for GET requests, parses URL query parameters, and responds with static HTML pages. The JavaScript in EXTRACT_TOKEN_PAGE extracts tokens from URL fragments and redirects to the server with query parameters, facilitating OAuth token retrieval. No external network calls, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident. The code's purpose aligns with standard OAuth redirect handling. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected. The implementation appears safe and typical for local OAuth flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward OAuth redirect handler that securely manages token extraction and display without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code, nor does it perform any suspicious actions beyond its intended purpose.",
