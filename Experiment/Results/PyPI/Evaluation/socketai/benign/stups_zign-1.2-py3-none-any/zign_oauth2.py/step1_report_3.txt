  "purpose": "The code implements a simple HTTP server to handle OAuth 2.0 redirect callbacks, extract access tokens from URL fragments, and display appropriate success or error pages.",
  "sources": "Reads URL path and query parameters, JavaScript extracts URL fragment data.",
  "sinks": "Response writing to client via self.wfile.write, JavaScript redirect with window.location.href.",
  "flows": "URL fragment (hash) is parsed by JavaScript, then a redirect occurs to localhost with query string; server extracts query parameters from the URL and stores them.",
  "anomalies": "Uses client-side JavaScript to parse URL hash fragments and redirect; no apparent hardcoded credentials or malicious code; no obfuscated code; no network communication other than serving pages.",
  "analysis": "The server handles OAuth redirect by parsing query parameters from the GET request. JavaScript extracts the access token from the URL hash, then redirects to localhost with the token in query string. The server then parses this query string and stores access tokens. The code appears straightforward, serving static pages for success, error, and extraction flow. No suspicious network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious code behavior detected. The JavaScript is standard for token extraction in OAuth flows. The server only processes GET requests and stores query parameters, which is normal for OAuth callback handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard OAuth redirect handler with client-side token extraction and server-side token parsing. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be a legitimate implementation for OAuth redirect handling.",
