  "purpose": "A minimal OAuth 2.0 redirect handler that serves static pages, extracts access tokens via JavaScript, and stores query parameters server-side.",
  "sources": "URL query string, URL hash fragment via JavaScript",
  "sinks": "Server-side storage of query parameters, serving HTML pages, JavaScript redirect to local server with token",
  "flows": "URL hash fragment parsed by JavaScript, which triggers a redirect to the server with token in query; server captures query parameters and displays success/error page",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code; standard OAuth implicit flow handling",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward OAuth redirect endpoint. It handles GET requests, serving static pages when no query string is present, and extracting tokens from URL hash via JavaScript. The server captures query parameters and displays success or error pages accordingly. The JavaScript token extraction method is standard for OAuth implicit flow. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. The logic is simple, with no hardcoded secrets or backdoors. The low risk scores assigned in the reports are justified given the benign purpose and implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign OAuth redirect handler with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) is appropriate. The malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. No further modifications are necessary.",
