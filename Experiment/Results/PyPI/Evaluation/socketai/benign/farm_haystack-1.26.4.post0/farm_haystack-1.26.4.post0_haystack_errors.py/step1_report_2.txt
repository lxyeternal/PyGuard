  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the Haystack framework and its integrations",
  "sources": "Class initializers, attribute accessors, string representations",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing or external data output observed",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes; accessing error attributes for message display",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or external connections; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from base exception classes, with optional attributes for messages, documentation links, and status codes. The methods provided handle attribute access and string representations, with no external data flows, network activity, or code execution. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or harmful behaviors. The design is standard for error handling and does not include any suspicious or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign, well-structured set of custom exception classes for error handling in the Haystack framework. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no external data or network activity. The code's purpose is solely to facilitate error reporting and management, with no security risks identified.",
