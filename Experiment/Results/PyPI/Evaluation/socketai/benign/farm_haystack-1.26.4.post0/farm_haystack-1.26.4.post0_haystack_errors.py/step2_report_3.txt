  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with constructors setting optional message, documentation link, and status code attributes.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n- The __getattr__ method attempts to delegate attribute access to the __cause__ exception, which is standard in exception chaining.\n- The purpose appears to be structured error handling within the Haystack framework.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and follows standard Python exception class patterns.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns.\n- **External data handling:** No external data inputs or outputs.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code or constructs.\n- **Security risk:** None apparent; the code is purely structural.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:\n- **__getattr__ implementation:** The method `def __getattr__(self, attr):` calls `getattr(self.__cause__, attr)` but does not return the attribute. This means attribute access via `HaystackError.attribute` will not return the value, leading to potential AttributeError or unexpected behavior. It should be:\n  ```python\n  def __getattr__(self, attr):\n      return getattr(self.__cause__, attr)\n  ```\n  This is a logical flaw that could cause attribute access issues when chaining exceptions.\n\n- **Inconsistent handling of `self.message`:** Some classes set `self.message` in `__init__`, but the base `Exception` class in Python 3 does not automatically assign `self.message`. Instead, the message should be passed to `super().__init__(message)` to ensure proper exception message behavior. Currently, `super().__init__()` is called without arguments, which might cause the exception's string representation to not include the message unless explicitly overridden.\n\n- **`__str__` method reliance on `self.message`:** Since `self.message` may not be set properly, the `__str__` method might raise an AttributeError if `self.message` is missing. It would be better to call `super().__str__()` or ensure `self.message` is initialized correctly.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score: 0** — No malicious code or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated score: 0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score: 0.0** — No security risk or vulnerabilities; primarily error class definitions.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The flaw in `__getattr__` could cause attribute access issues, but it does not introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- The inconsistent handling of `message` attributes might cause confusion but not security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- Correct the `__getattr__` method to include a return statement.\n- Pass `message` to `super().__init__(message)` in each class constructor to ensure proper exception message handling.\n- No change in malware or obfuscation scores; they remain at 0.\n- The overall security risk remains at 0, as the code is purely structural.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall assessment:**\n\n| Aspect | Score / Comment |\n|---------|------------------|\n| Malware | 0.0 — No malicious code detected |\n| Obfuscated | 0.0 — Clear, standard class definitions |\n| Risk | 0.0 — No security vulnerabilities; purely error handling classes |\n\n**Note:** The only technical flaw is the missing `return` in `__getattr__` and the inconsistent use of `self.message`. These are bugs but not security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a well-structured, benign set of custom exception classes for the Haystack framework. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The primary concern is a minor bug in `__getattr__` implementation, which should be fixed for correctness but does not impact security.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Fix `__getattr__` method.  \n- Ensure all exception classes pass `message` to `super().__init__()` for proper exception message handling.  \n- No change in malware, obfuscated, or risk scores.",
