  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the Haystack framework.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains class definitions and initializations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is read from or written to external sources.",
  "flows": "None; the code is purely class definitions without runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists of standard Python exception class definitions with typical inheritance and initializations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception base class, mainly for specific error handling in various modules such as modeling, agents, pipelines, document stores, and external APIs like OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, AWS, Amazon Bedrock, SageMaker, and Anthropic. The classes include optional attributes for error messages, status codes, and documentation links, with no dynamic code execution or external data access mechanisms. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code's structure is consistent with standard practices for creating custom exceptions and contains no obfuscated or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions for error handling within the Haystack framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
