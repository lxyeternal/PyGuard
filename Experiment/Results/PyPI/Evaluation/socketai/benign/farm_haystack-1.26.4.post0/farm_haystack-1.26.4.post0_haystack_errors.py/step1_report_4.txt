  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the Haystack framework to handle various error scenarios with optional documentation links and controlled message forwarding.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and attribute accessors, particularly the __init__ methods and __getattr__ override.",
  "sinks": "Super().__init__ calls, attribute assignments, and string concatenation in __str__ methods.",
  "flows": "Initialization of exception instances from various subclasses, attribute access in __getattr__, string representation in __str__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no network operations, and no data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with no input handling, data processing, or network operations. __init__ methods set optional messages and documentation links, while __getattr__ forwards attribute access to the cause exception if present. The __str__ method appends documentation links when available. These patterns are standard for exception handling and do not include malicious behavior. There are no indications of code injection, external data handling, or other malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes for error handling in the Haystack framework. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. All observed patterns are consistent with standard exception class design. Overall, this code is safe and does not pose supply chain threats.",
