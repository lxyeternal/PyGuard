{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within the Haystack framework, including specific errors for various modules and external APIs.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, constructor methods, attribute accessors, and string representation methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the __getattr__ method accessing attributes of __cause__, but no actual untrusted data sources or external inputs are processed.",
  "flows": "Initialization of error objects, optional access to attributes of chained exceptions, and string representations for errors.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or obfuscated constructs. Use of optional parameters with default values appears standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines exception classes with constructors that set attributes and manage error messaging. There is no handling of user input, no network operations, no file I/O, and no code injection mechanisms. The __getattr__ method attempts to access attributes of __cause__, but without any dynamic or unsafe code execution. All URLs and messages are standard documentation links. Overall, the code is purely structural, meant for error categorization, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for structured error handling. There are no malicious behaviors, no suspicious data flows, and no obfuscated or harmful code. It appears to be a benign, well-structured module intended for internal error management within the Haystack project.",
