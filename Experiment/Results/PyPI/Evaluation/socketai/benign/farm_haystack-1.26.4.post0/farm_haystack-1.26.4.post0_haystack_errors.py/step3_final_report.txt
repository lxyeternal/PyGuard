{
  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of custom exception classes for the Haystack framework, categorizing errors and providing structured messaging.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and attribute accessors, especially the __getattr__ method and optional message parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and attribute access; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The __getattr__ method calls getattr(self.__cause__, attr) without returning its value, which is a logical bug but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python exception class definitions with optional message, docs_link, and status_code attributes. The __getattr__ method is intended to delegate attribute access to __cause__, but it lacks a return statement, which may cause attribute access issues. No external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is purely structural, with no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 are consistent with the benign, straightforward nature of the code. The main concern is the missing return in __getattr__, which should be fixed for correctness, but it does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured set of custom exception classes with no malicious or obfuscated content. The only technical flaw is the __getattr__ method missing a return statement, which should be corrected. Overall, the code poses no security threat, and the current scores are appropriate.",
