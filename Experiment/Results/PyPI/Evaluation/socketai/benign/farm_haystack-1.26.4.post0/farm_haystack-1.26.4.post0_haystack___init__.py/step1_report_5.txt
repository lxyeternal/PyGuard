{
  "purpose": "To import necessary modules and set environment configurations for the haystack library, including version retrieval and secure model loading setup.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata for retrieving package version, haystack modules for data structures and components, and a function call to set secure model loading environment variable.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data processing; environment variable setting is safe if controlled.",
  "flows": "Retrieving package version via metadata, setting environment variable for secure model loading, importing modules without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets observed. Import order and environment variable setup appear standard. The code explicitly avoids using torch directly, indicating caution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules necessary for a larger application, retrieves the package version, and configures a security setting for model loading via environment variables. The comments and structure indicate an intent to enhance security without executing untrusted data. No obfuscated code, malicious imports, or suspicious behaviors are present. The environment variable setup appears legitimate and controlled. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python project, specifically configuring environment security and importing necessary modules. It does not contain malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious activity. It appears safe and intentionally designed for secure environment configuration.",
