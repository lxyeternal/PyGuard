  "purpose": "Initialize environment and import necessary modules for the haystack library, and retrieve the package version.",
  "sources": "metadata.version('farm-haystack') call, import statements, set_pytorch_secure_model_loading() function",
  "sinks": "metadata.version() call retrieves package version; set_pytorch_secure_model_loading() sets environment variable for secure model loading",
  "flows": "metadata.version() reads package info; set_pytorch_secure_model_loading() influences environment variables used by torch",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures observed. Importing 'haystack.silenceable_tqdm' to modify tqdm behavior is noted but not suspicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules and sets environment variables related to secure model loading. The call to 'metadata.version()' retrieves package version info, which is standard. The import of 'haystack.silenceable_tqdm' is for tqdm wrapping but does not introduce malicious behavior. The setting of environment variables to ensure secure model loading is a good security practice and does not appear malicious. No suspicious data flows, code injection, or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup and initialization script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly focuses on secure model loading and proper module imports without performing any suspicious actions.",
