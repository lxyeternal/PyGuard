{
  "purpose": "This code implements a 128-bit Murmur3 hash function, providing hash computations for data using either 64-bit or 32-bit architectures.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via the 'key' parameter in the 'hash128' function, and also processes Python version info from 'sys.version_info'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain external data sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or other output channels.",
  "flows": "Input data (key) is encoded and then passed to internal hashing functions (hash128_x64 or hash128_x86), which process and return a hash value.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code uses standard hash algorithms without any obfuscation or unusual constructs. The initial sys import is benign. No suspicious network or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'sys' solely to determine Python version, defining 'xrange' and 'xencode' for compatibility. The main function 'hash128' implements a standard Murmur3 hash, including complex bit manipulations and final mixing functions. No external data transmission, file access, or environment manipulation occurs. The code appears to be a straightforward hash implementation with no malicious behaviors or sabotage indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of Murmur3 hash functions with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior. It solely performs data hashing based on input data and system architecture detection.",
