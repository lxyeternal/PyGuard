  "purpose": "Implementation of 128-bit Murmur3 hash function supporting both x64 and x86 architectures, used for hashing input data.",
  "sources": "Input data 'key' read via function parameter, encoded with 'xencode'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; the code does not transmit data or modify system state.",
  "flows": "Input data is encoded, then processed through complex bitwise operations and rotations within hash functions, culminating in a combined hash output.",
  "anomalies": "High cyclomatic complexity due to algorithmic nature; no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of Murmur3 128-bit hashing supporting both architectures. It reads input data, encodes it, and performs cryptographic hash computations with bitwise operations, rotations, and finalization steps. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or malicious code is present. The high complexity is typical for cryptographic functions, not indicative of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of Murmur3 hash functions with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for use, and no further action is necessary.",
