  "purpose": "Implementations of 128-bit Murmur3 hash functions for hashing data, supporting both x64 and x86 architectures.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'sys' module for version info, input data 'key' in hash functions, and optional 'seed' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The 'hash128' function processes input data but does not write to external systems or network; no data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data 'key' flows into the hashing functions, processed internally with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a large, complex hash function implementation with high cyclomatic complexity, but no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious operations are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script defines compatibility functions based on Python version and implements two variants of the Murmur3 hashing algorithm for 128-bit hashes, supporting both x64 and x86 architectures. No input/output operations, network communication, or system modifications are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious code are detected. The only notable aspect is the high complexity of the hash functions, which appear to be straightforward implementations of well-known algorithms. The code solely computes hashes; it does not perform any malicious activity such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard hash function implementation with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It serves to generate hash values from input data without external interactions or malicious behavior.",
