  "purpose": "Implement 128-bit Murmur3 hash functions for data hashing, supporting both x64 and x86 architectures.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'key' parameter, which is encoded to bytes via 'xencode'. No external or untrusted input sources are directly used within the code.",
  "sinks": "The code processes data internally and returns a hash value. No data is sent over the network, written to files, or stored persistently. No external systems are contacted.",
  "flows": "Input data (key) is encoded, processed through hashing functions, and the resulting hash value is returned. No external data flows or untrusted output paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code has very high cyclomatic complexity, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code relies on bitwise operations typical of hashing algorithms and does not perform any unusual operations.",
  "analysis": "The code implements Murmur3 hash functions for data hashing with support for different architectures. It encodes input data to bytes, processes data through complex bitwise operations, and returns a 128-bit hash. The code appears to be a standard implementation of a well-known hashing algorithm. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or network activity. It is self-contained, performs a legitimate cryptographic hash function, and does not interact with external systems or sensitive information. The high cyclomatic complexity is consistent with complex hashing algorithms and does not suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of the Murmur3 hashing algorithm with no malicious behavior detected. It processes data internally for hashing purposes and does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious activity. No security risks or malware signals are identified.",
