{
  "purpose": "This code defines a wrapper class LazyImport that extends a context manager to handle import errors gracefully by customizing error messages, primarily used for lazy importing modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported exception object exc_value during an exception in the __exit__ method.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data to external sources; it only processes exceptions locally.",
  "flows": "Exception raised during import triggers __exit__, which then constructs a custom error message, but no data is transmitted externally or performs malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code relies on standard exception handling and class extension.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward extension of a context manager for handling import errors, with the purpose of providing user-friendly messages. It checks for ImportError and constructs a message indicating which module failed to import. No data leaks, network activity, or malicious code are present. The use of __exit__ and exception handling is standard and safe. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for improved error handling during lazy imports. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
