{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom context manager class for handling import errors gracefully, providing customizable error messages when a module fails to import.",
  "sources": "Input source is the import failure, specifically handling ImportError exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the storing of exception details and the suppression of exceptions within the __exit__ method.",
  "flows": "When an ImportError occurs, the exception is caught, a message is constructed, and the exception is suppressed, preventing it from propagating.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic detected. The code cleanly wraps existing functionality without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code extends a context manager to customize import error handling. It captures ImportError exceptions, formats an error message, stores exception info, and suppresses the exception. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage. The implementation appears to be straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a benign wrapper for handling import errors with customizable messages. No malicious or suspicious activity is present.",
