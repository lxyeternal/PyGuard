  "purpose": "Wraps lazy_import's _DeferredImportExceptionContextManager to add customizable error messages for import failures.",
  "sources": "Imports the class LazyImport, the exception type ImportError, and accesses the attribute exc_value.name.",
  "sinks": "Formats error messages using self.import_error_msg.format(exc_value.name), which involves string formatting with possibly untrusted data.",
  "flows": "When an ImportError occurs in the context, it constructs a custom message using the exception's 'name' attribute, potentially influencing output or logs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or obfuscation detected. The code handles import errors gracefully, adding custom messaging.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of a context manager to handle import errors. It captures ImportError exceptions, formats an error message with the exception's 'name' attribute, and stores it. The message construction uses string formatting, but the data used is from a known attribute of the exception object, which is unlikely to be malicious. The code includes descriptive docstrings and straightforward logic, with no evidence of obfuscation or malicious behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a safe and straightforward error handling mechanism for import failures, adding custom messaging without any malicious intent. No security risks or malware indications are evident.",
