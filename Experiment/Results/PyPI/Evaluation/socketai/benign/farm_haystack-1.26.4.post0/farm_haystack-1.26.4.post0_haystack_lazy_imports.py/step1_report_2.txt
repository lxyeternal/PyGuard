{
  "purpose": "To create a wrapper class around lazy_import's _DeferredImportExceptionContextManager that allows custom error messages when an import fails.",
  "sources": "The class __init__ method initializes with a default message; the __exit__ method processes exceptions, specifically ImportError, and formats error messages.",
  "sinks": "The __exit__ method assigns to self._deferred when an ImportError occurs, which could be accessed elsewhere; no direct sinks for untrusted data present.",
  "flows": "ImportError raised during import attempts triggers __exit__, which captures the exception and formats a message; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Usage of class inheritance, exception handling, and string formatting appears standard. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass LazyImport that extends a context manager to handle import errors with customizable messages. It intercepts ImportError exceptions, formats a message, and suppresses the exception. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code seems to serve a legitimate purpose of improved import error handling, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign wrapper for handling import errors with custom messaging. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It operates as intended for improving error reporting without any suspicious or malicious features.",
