{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to collect system and environment information for the Haystack library, including environment detection, system specs, and environment setup functions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., TORCH_FORCE_WEIGHTS_ONLY_LOAD, HAYSTACK_MPS_ENABLED), filesystem checks (/run/.containernv, /.dockerenv, /proc/self/cgroup, /proc/self/mountinfo), and imported modules (platform, sys, torch, transformers).",
  "sinks": "Environment variables (modification with os.environ), filesystem checks (os.path.exists, os.path.isfile), and logging (logger.info).",
  "flows": "Environment variable checks and updates (set_pytorch_secure_model_loading), detection functions querying filesystem for containerization, and data collection functions aggregating system info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code behaviors detected; all filesystem checks, environment variable modifications, and module imports appear standard and related to system/environment detection. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated code. The use of LazyImport is standard for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment detection (containerized or not) through filesystem checks and environment variables. It gathers system specifications and attempts to import optional modules (torch, transformers) safely using LazyImport. The set_pytorch_secure_model_loading function sets an environment variable to enforce secure model loading in PyTorch, which is a best practice. All operations are local system checks or standard library usages, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No network communication, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The overall structure and usage of environment checks suggest legitimate environment setup and info collection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard system and environment introspection utility for the Haystack library. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads. All actions are related to system detection and configuration management. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
