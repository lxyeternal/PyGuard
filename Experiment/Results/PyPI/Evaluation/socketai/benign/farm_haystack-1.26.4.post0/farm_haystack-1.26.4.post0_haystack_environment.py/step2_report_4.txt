  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checkting the code details, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily about environment detection, system info collection, and configuring secure model loading.\n- It uses standard techniques: environment variables, filesystem checks, module imports, and lazy import patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code are evident.\n- The functions for container detection (checking for files like `/run/.containernv`, `/.dockerenv`, and cgroup files) are standard methods.\n- The environment variable `TORCH_FORCE_WEIGHTS_ONLY_LOAD` is set to enforce secure model loading, which aligns with best practices.\n- LazyImport is used for optional dependencies, which is common and benign.\n- No suspicious data flows, code injections, or backdoors are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms standard system detection and lazy import.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- Security risk is minimal (0.2).\n- Confidence is high (0.9).\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues found.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing environment detection and safe configuration.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n- Same low security risk.\n- Confidence high.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Focuses on environment detection and system info collection.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Confidence high.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Highlights environment detection, system specs, and environment setup.\n- No malicious behavior.\n- Confidence high.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, emphasizing environment detection and safe configuration.\n- No suspicious activity.\n- Confidence high.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking for Malicious or Obfuscated Content:\n\n- The code does not contain any obfuscated logic, hidden code, or suspicious network activity.\n- Environment detection methods are standard.\n- Setting environment variables for secure model loading is a security best practice, not malicious.\n- LazyImport for optional dependencies is benign.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors.\n\n### Scores Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, low scores (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports seem reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code is transparent and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — Minimal security risk, mostly related to environment misconfigurations, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured utility module for environment detection and system info collection within the Haystack framework. It employs common techniques, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect a benign, transparent utility code with low security concerns.",
