{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for environment detection, system specifications collection, and safe model loading configurations within the Haystack NLP framework.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., TORCH_FORCE_WEIGHTS_ONLY_LOAD, HAYSTACK_MPS_ENABLED), filesystem paths (/run/.containernv, /.dockerenv, /proc/self/cgroup, /proc/self/mountinfo), imported modules (torch, transformers, pytest, ray, ipython, google.colab).",
  "sinks": "Environment variables setting (os.environ), reading system files (/proc/self/cgroup, /proc/self/mountinfo), importing modules (potential for malicious imports if modules are compromised).",
  "flows": "Reading environment variables or files (sources) triggers conditional logic and module imports, influencing system detection and configuration settings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. Usage of LazyImport with messages might obscure dependencies, but this is standard for optional dependencies. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily utility functions for environment detection and system info collection, with dynamic imports for optional dependencies. It performs environment checks for containerization and GPU availability, and sets environment variables securely for model loading. No network communications, data exfiltration, or harmful behaviors are observed. The code appears to be well-structured, with proper use of environment variables and filesystem checks. No indicators of malicious activity or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module aimed at environment detection and system information gathering for the Haystack framework. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
