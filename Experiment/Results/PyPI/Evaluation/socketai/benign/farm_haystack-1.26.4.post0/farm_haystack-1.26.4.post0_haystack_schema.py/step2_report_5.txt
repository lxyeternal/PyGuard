  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles data structures, serialization, evaluation, and storage for documents, answers, labels, and evaluation results. No untrusted external data sources, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no credentials, or backdoors are observed.\n- **Flow & sinks:** Data flows from input parameters/files into objects and then into CSV/JSON outputs. File operations are standard.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** The code is standard, legitimate, and safe for its purpose.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0.05 (very low, just standard file I/O and data handling)  \n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code manages data classes, serialization, and evaluation metrics. Uses safe functions like `ast.literal_eval`. No network, environment variable access, or malicious patterns.\n- **Flow & sinks:** Standard data flow through files and internal processing.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** The code is a typical data processing module with no malicious behavior.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0.05  \n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines data classes, evaluation metrics, and serialization for NLP/IR pipelines. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. Uses safe functions like `ast.literal_eval`. Focused on data management.\n- **Flow & sinks:** Standard serialization/deserialization, file I/O.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity, purely evaluation/data handling.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0.1 (slightly higher but still negligible; perhaps due to file handling, but nothing suspicious)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard data classes, evaluation, serialization, no network or system modifications, no obfuscated code.\n- **Flow & sinks:** File I/O and data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Legitimate data handling, no malicious signs.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0.1\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, data classes, serialization, evaluation, no suspicious code, no network, no environment variable access, no dynamic execution.\n- **Flow & sinks:** Standard file and data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Clear, legitimate code.\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Security risk:** 0.05\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity, no obfuscated code, no network or system access, and no suspicious patterns. The code is focused on data management, serialization, and evaluation metrics, which are standard in NLP/IR pipelines.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports, no signs of obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any suspicious activity, external code execution, or malicious patterns, the risk score should be very low, around 0.05 to 0.1 at most, reflecting standard data handling.\n\n### **Final conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.05\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation for document and evaluation management in an NLP pipeline, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain compromise.\n\n---\n\n**Would you like me to provide a summarized report or further details?**",
