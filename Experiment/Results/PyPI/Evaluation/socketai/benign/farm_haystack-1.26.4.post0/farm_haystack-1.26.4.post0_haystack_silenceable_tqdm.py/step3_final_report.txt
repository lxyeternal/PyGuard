  "purpose": "Control tqdm progress bar display dynamically based on environment variable HAYSTACK_PROGRESS_BARS.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable HAYSTACK_PROGRESS_BARS during property access.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication; affects only UI display.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check influences the disable property, which controls progress bar visibility.",
  "anomalies": "Global replacement of tqdm classes could impact other parts of the system unexpectedly; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass that toggles tqdm progress bars based on an environment variable, replacing tqdm classes globally. It is straightforward, with no malicious intent, data leaks, or suspicious patterns. The environment variable check is standard, and the code is clear. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0-0.1) are consistent with its benign nature. The only minor concern is the global override potentially affecting system behavior, but this is not security-related.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward wrapper for tqdm that enables or disables progress bars based on an environment variable. It does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation. The slight risk score reflects potential side effects of global class replacement but is not indicative of security issues.",
