      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes in Django, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are accurate and should remain at zero for malware and risk, with high confidence in this assessment."

The only notable risk involves dynamic import safety, which can be mitigated through validation. Overall, the supply chain security posture is minimal, with scores correctly reflecting the low threat level."

      "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard exception handling module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only potential future concern is the 'exception_reporter' placeholder, which could be extended to perform external communications, but as it stands, it is harmless. The current security posture is minimal risk, appropriate for production use."

It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and justified."
