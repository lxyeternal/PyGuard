  "purpose": "This code re-exports the 'exception_handler' function from a local module, serving as a simple module export.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .handler module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external communications present",
  "flows": "Import from local module to module export (__all__)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; minimal, straightforward code with no suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module and exposes it via __all__, with no data flows, input handling, or external communications. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is benign and serves as a simple export. Scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with this analysis. Confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty in benignity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward module export with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
