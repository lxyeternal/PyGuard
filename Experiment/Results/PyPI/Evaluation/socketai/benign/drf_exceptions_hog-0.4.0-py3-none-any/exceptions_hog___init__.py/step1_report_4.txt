  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "The code only imports a function and exposes it via __all__; no data flows or processing occur.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a specific function and declares it for export, indicating typical module setup. No input handling, data processing, or external communication is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are detectable in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign module definition that exports an exception handler. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
