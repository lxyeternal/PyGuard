  "purpose": "Exports the 'exception_handler' function or object from the current package module.",
  "sources": "Imports 'exception_handler' from a local module called 'handler'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports a local component and exposes it publicly; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "This is a straightforward module that re-exports 'exception_handler' from a sibling module 'handler'. It uses relative import syntax and defines '__all__' for explicit exports. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or other suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to serve a simple organizational purpose within a package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module export without any malicious behavior or security risks identified. It functions as part of a package's public interface.",
