{
  "purpose": "Exports the 'exception_handler' function from the local 'handler' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'exception_handler' from a relative module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external output sources present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing beyond module import and export.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; the only notable feature is a straightforward import and export statement.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single component 'exception_handler' from a relative module 'handler' and exposes it via __all__. There are no user inputs, external data sources, or complex logic. The code structure is standard for Python modules intended for API exposure. No signs of malicious activity such as obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, standard, and appears benign. It functions solely to re-export a handler, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
