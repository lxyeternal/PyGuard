  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is a straightforward import and export of a function named `exception_handler` from a local module `handler`.\n   - The code snippet is minimal, with no data processing, input handling, or external communications.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign and serves as a module export.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - The security risk scores are 0, aligning with the analysis that there's no security concern.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a module re-export with no external data or untrusted inputs, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - No justification exists for higher risk scores, and the reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n   - There are no indications of malicious activity, such as code injection, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on direct analysis; no unwarranted assumptions are present.\n   - The reports do not speculate beyond what the code demonstrates.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are appropriate.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Estimated Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Estimated Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Estimated Security Risk Score:** 0 (no security issues)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a simple, benign module that re-exports a function from a local handler module. All reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe.\n- No malicious or security issues are present.\n- The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
