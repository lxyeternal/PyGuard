  "purpose": "Standard exception handling and classification for Django REST Framework, formatting error responses and providing hooks for external reporting.",
  "sources": "Exception attributes (e.g., 'detail', 'get_codes()'), exception type checks, settings for reporting and error classification.",
  "sinks": "Response construction, error detail extraction, potential external reporting via 'EXCEPTION_REPORTING' hook.",
  "flows": "Exception occurs -> normalized via '_normalize_exception_codes' -> classified by '_get_main_exception_and_code' -> formatted into response data -> optional external report via 'EXCEPTION_REPORTING' -> response returned.",
  "anomalies": "The 'exception_reporter' function is a placeholder ('pass') with no implementation, which could be extended to send data externally. No other suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured exception handler for Django REST Framework, with functions to classify, normalize, and format error responses. It includes a stub for reporting exceptions, which currently does nothing but could be extended. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The exception classification relies on standard DRF exception types, and the response formatting is straightforward. The placeholder 'exception_reporter' is benign in its current state but warrants caution if later implemented to send data externally. The scores assigned by previous reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, low risk 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard exception handling module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The only potential future concern is the 'exception_reporter' placeholder, which could be extended to perform external communications, but as it stands, it is harmless. The current security posture is minimal risk, appropriate for production use.",
