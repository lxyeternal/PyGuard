  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard exception handling and reporting framework for Django REST Framework.\n- The code normalizes exceptions, classifies error types, and constructs user-friendly error responses.\n- The exception reporting function (`exception_reporter`) is a placeholder that currently does nothing.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, malicious network calls, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The logic is consistent with secure, standard practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues or vulnerabilities are evident in the code snippets.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected. The code is primarily about exception classification and response formatting.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Suspicious external network activity:** None. The only external call is to `api_settings.EXCEPTION_REPORTING`, which is a configurable hook, currently a no-op.\n- **Credentials/backdoors:** Not present.\n- **Data leaks:** No evidence of data leaks or sensitive info exposure.\n- **Code injection or dynamic execution:** Not present.\n\n---\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning errors:\n- The code appears well-structured, with proper exception handling, normalization, and response formatting.\n- The placeholder `exception_reporter` function could be extended for external monitoring, but as-is, it is benign.\n- The normalization functions are comprehensive, handling nested exception codes.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, mainly from the placeholder reporting function which could be extended in insecure ways if modified later, but currently safe.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The only minor concern is the `exception_reporter` being a stub. If later implemented to send data externally, it could pose risks depending on what data is sent and how. But in its current state, it is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to potential future extension, but currently negligible)\n\nThis code is a standard, well-implemented exception handling module with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It’s consistent with secure coding practices.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is secure, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n- The placeholder `exception_reporter` is benign but should be reviewed if extended.\n- No evidence of supply chain compromise or malicious payloads.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain current scores, with a note to review the extension of `exception_reporter` if it later includes external communication.",
