  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, considering the details provided:\n\n**Overall Summary of Reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as a standard, well-structured exception handling and reporting framework for Django REST Framework.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity are identified.\n- The only noteworthy point is that the `exception_reporter` function is a placeholder (`pass`) with no implementation, which could be extended later to send data externally, but as it stands, it does not pose a threat.\n- No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code appears to be consistent with secure exception management practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The `exception_reporter` function is a stub (`pass`) with no actual reporting logic. While benign now, if later implemented to send data externally, it could introduce security concerns depending on its use.\n- No other issues, vulnerabilities, or code flaws are evident.\n\n### Logical or Reasoning Flaws:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent. The code's flow, exception classification, normalization, and response formatting follow standard patterns.\n- The normalization functions and exception type mapping are consistent and well-structured.\n- The handling of exception attributes and response data is appropriate.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting minimal security risk—mainly due to the placeholder reporter function, which could be extended later.\n\n**Recommendation:** The current scores seem reasonable. The low risk scores are justified, considering no malicious activity is present.\n\n### Justification for Higher Risk Scores:\n- The only potential concern is the placeholder `exception_reporter`. If later extended to send data externally, it could be misused, but in its current state, it is benign.\n- No other security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n### Consistency and Assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is secure and do not speculate beyond the current implementation.\n- No assumptions about future malicious activity are made, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or payloads detected.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to the placeholder function that could be extended later.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimation:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, secure exception handling module with no current malicious or obfuscated elements. The only minor concern is the placeholder `exception_reporter`, which, if later used for external reporting, could introduce security risks. However, as is, it does not.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No immediate security issues. Keep an eye on future extensions of `exception_reporter`.",
