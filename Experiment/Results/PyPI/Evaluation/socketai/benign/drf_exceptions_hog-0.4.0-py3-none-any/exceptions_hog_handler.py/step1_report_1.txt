{
  "purpose": "This code provides a custom exception handling and reporting framework for a Django REST Framework application, mapping various exceptions to standardized error responses.",
  "sources": "Exception attributes such as 'detail', 'exception_type', 'default_type', and 'get_codes' methods; settings attributes; request object; imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Response construction with error details; exception reporting to external monitoring systems via 'api_settings.EXCEPTION_REPORTING'; modification of exceptions and response data.",
  "flows": "Exception is caught in 'exception_handler' -> exception is normalized and classified -> error details are extracted -> response dict is built -> sent back as DRF Response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external network calls are present. The exception reporting function is a placeholder ('pass') with no implementation, which is benign in this context. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected. The code mainly handles exception classification and response formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard exception handling mechanism for Django REST Framework, with functions for classifying exceptions, normalizing error codes, and generating user-friendly error responses. It also includes hooks for reporting exceptions but does not perform any actual reporting. No suspicious or malicious activities such as data exfiltration, unauthorized network communication, or backdoors are present. The structure and logic appear consistent with secure exception management. The placeholder 'exception_reporter' function is benign, and the code does not contain obfuscated patterns or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard exception handling utility for Django REST Framework with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It responsibly handles exceptions, normalizes error information, and prepares error responses without engaging in any suspicious activities or data leaks.",
