  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a standard exception handling framework for Django REST Framework.\n- No malicious activities, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected.\n- The only potential concern is the placeholder `exception_reporter` function, which currently does nothing but could be extended later to send data externally.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior is present.\n- The security risk scores are very low (around 0.1 to 0.2), consistent with benign code.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9), reflecting strong agreement among reviewers.\n\n**Confirmations & Validations:**\n- The code does not contain hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious network calls.\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n- The exception handling logic aligns with best practices, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious manipulations.\n- The `exception_reporter` function is a stub; in its current state, it does not pose any risk.\n\n**Potential Flaws or Logical Errors:**\n- The only minor point is the placeholder nature of `exception_reporter`. If later extended improperly, it could be used to send data externally, but as it stands, it is benign.\n- No other logical flaws or security issues are identified.\n\n**Scores & Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. This is justified given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, consistent with the clear, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low (~0.1-0.2), justified because the code is standard exception handling with no active threats.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a well-structured, standard exception handling module for Django REST Framework.\n- No evidence of supply chain attack vectors, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The only note is the placeholder `exception_reporter`, which, if later misused, could pose a risk, but currently, it does not.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the potential extension of the reporting function, but in current form, negligible)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code appears safe, standard, and free from malicious intent. No further action needed unless the `exception_reporter` function is later implemented with external calls or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
