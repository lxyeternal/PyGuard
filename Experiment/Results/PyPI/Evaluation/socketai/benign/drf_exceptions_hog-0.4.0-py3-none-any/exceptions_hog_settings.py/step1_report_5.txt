  "purpose": "Configure exception handling settings for a Django application using REST framework.",
  "sources": "Retrieves 'EXCEPTIONS_HOG' attribute from Django settings.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; potential dynamic import string used in settings.",
  "flows": "Gets settings from Django config, applies defaults, and prepares APISettings object.",
  "anomalies": "Uses string import notation for 'EXCEPTION_REPORTING', which could be manipulated if user-controlled. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code safely retrieves user-configured settings and applies defaults. It uses Django's getattr to fetch 'EXCEPTIONS_HOG', which is optional. The string 'EXCEPTION_REPORTING' is listed for import as a string, which is standard practice for configurable import paths. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code flow. No external network access, data leaks, or code injection mechanisms are present. The code appears to be standard configuration setup, with potential risk if user-controlled settings influence string imports, but nothing inherently malicious is observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration pattern for Django and REST framework settings with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
