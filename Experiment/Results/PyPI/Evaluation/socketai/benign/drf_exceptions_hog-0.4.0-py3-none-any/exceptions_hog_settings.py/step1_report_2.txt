  "purpose": "Configure and load application-specific exception handling settings for a Django project using REST framework.",
  "sources": "Reading settings from Django's global settings object (`settings.EXCEPTIONS_HOG`) and initializing APISettings with defaults.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink that processes untrusted input; primarily configuration loading.",
  "flows": "Loading configuration from Django settings -> passing to APISettings -> potentially using string import notation for dynamic import.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard configuration pattern. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code safely retrieves a custom setting (`EXCEPTIONS_HOG`) from Django settings. It defines default values and a tuple for import strings, which are used by the `APISettings` class. The code appears to be a typical pattern for dynamic configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior. No untrusted data handling or suspicious flow was observed. There are no backdoors, malicious code, or data exfiltration mechanisms present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration setup for exception handling settings in a Django REST framework project. It appears benign with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
