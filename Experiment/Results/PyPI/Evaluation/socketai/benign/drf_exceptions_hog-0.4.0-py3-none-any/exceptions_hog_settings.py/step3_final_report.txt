  "purpose": "Configure exception handling in a Django REST framework project with dynamic import support for customizable reporting handlers.",
  "sources": "Retrieves 'EXCEPTIONS_HOG' from Django settings; uses DEFAULTS for fallback; specifies 'EXCEPTION_REPORTING' as import string.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import via string notation; potential for unsafe import if 'EXCEPTION_REPORTING' is misconfigured.",
  "flows": "Settings retrieval -> APISettings initialization -> dynamic import of handler if specified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import string is standard but could be misused if settings are maliciously altered; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Django configuration pattern managing optional user settings with defaults and dynamic import strings. No malicious code, secrets, or obfuscation are present. The primary security concern is the potential for unsafe dynamic import if 'EXCEPTION_REPORTING' is set to a malicious module, but this is a known pattern in pluggable systems. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate, reflecting minimal inherent risk mostly related to configuration correctness. The code's straightforward nature and standard pattern suggest low security threat, with the main mitigation being validation of user-provided import paths.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration snippet with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The only notable risk involves dynamic import safety, which can be mitigated through validation. Overall, the supply chain security posture is minimal, with scores correctly reflecting the low threat level.",
