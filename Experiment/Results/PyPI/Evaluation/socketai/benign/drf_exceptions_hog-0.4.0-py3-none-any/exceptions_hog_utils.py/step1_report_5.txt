  "purpose": "Utility function decorator to ensure the return value of a function is a string, converting Enums and other types accordingly.",
  "sources": "The decorated function's return value, which can be any type, including Enum or other data.",
  "sinks": "The use of force_str to convert return values to strings; potential for misuse if untrusted data is passed, but not inherently dangerous.",
  "flows": "The decorated function executes, its return value is captured, then potentially converted via force_str, especially if it is an Enum or other type.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, with standard usage of decorators and type conversions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that wraps any function, capturing its return value. If the return value is an Enum, it converts the Enum's value to a string using force_str. Otherwise, it converts the returned value directly to a string. No input/output operations, network calls, or security-sensitive operations are present. The use of force_str is standard in Django for encoding purposes and does not introduce security risks. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a utility for type normalization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility decorator designed to enforce string return types, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
