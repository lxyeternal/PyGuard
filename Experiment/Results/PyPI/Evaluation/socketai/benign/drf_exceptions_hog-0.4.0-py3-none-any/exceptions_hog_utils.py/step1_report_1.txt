{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator that ensures the return value of a function is converted to a string, handling Enum types appropriately.",
  "sources": "The decorator calls the decorated function with *args and **kwargs to obtain its return value.",
  "sinks": "The code uses force_str to convert the return value to a string, which is a safe operation. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the decorated function; its output is then processed and converted into a string, with special handling for Enum types.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code appears straightforward and does not include any suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a decorator 'ensure_string' that wraps a function. Inside the wrapper, it calls the original function, then checks if the result is an Enum. If so, it retrieves the Enum's value and converts it to a string; otherwise, it converts the original result directly to a string. The use of 'force_str' is a typical Django utility for string conversion. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling. The code performs a simple, well-defined task safely.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign decorator for string conversion with proper handling of Enum types. It does not contain malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
