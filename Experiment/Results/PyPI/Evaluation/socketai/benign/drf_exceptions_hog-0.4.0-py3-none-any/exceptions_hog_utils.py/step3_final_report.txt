  "purpose": "A decorator that wraps a function, calls it, and converts its return value to a string, handling Enum types specifically.",
  "sources": "The wrapped function's return value",
  "sinks": "The output of the decorator after conversion to string",
  "flows": "Function execution -> return value -> check for Enum -> extract value if Enum -> convert to string via force_str",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard use of Django's force_str; proper handling of Enum; no suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'ensure_string' that wraps any function, executes it, and processes its return value. If the return value is an Enum, it extracts the 'value' attribute; otherwise, it directly converts the result to a string using Django's 'force_str'. The code is straightforward, with no external data sources, network activity, or suspicious patterns. It handles Enum types correctly and safely converts data to strings. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of 'force_str' is standard in Django for safe string conversion. The code is a benign utility for ensuring string output, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard utility decorator for converting function outputs to strings, with proper handling of Enums. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and justified.",
