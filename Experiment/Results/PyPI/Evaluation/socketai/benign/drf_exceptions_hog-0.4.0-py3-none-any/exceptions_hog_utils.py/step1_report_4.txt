{
  "purpose": "The code provides a decorator to ensure that the output of a function is converted to a string, handling Enum types specifically.",
  "sources": "The decorator reads data from the function it wraps, capturing the return value.",
  "sinks": "The returned value is converted using 'force_str', which could potentially be a sink if untrusted data is passed to the wrapped function, but in this context, it appears to process internal data.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed by the wrapped function, and its return value flows through the wrapper, where it is conditionally converted to a string using 'force_str'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for ensuring string output.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'ensure_string' that wraps a function to convert its return value into a string, specifically handling Enum objects by converting their 'value' attribute. The use of 'force_str' from Django's utils suggests it is designed for proper string conversion compatible with Django. There are no inputs reading from external sources, no sinks that pose risks, and no flow leading to data leaks or malicious activity. The code's structure is simple, clear, and typical for utility functions in Django projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility decorator with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is standard in Django applications for handling string conversions. There are no anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
