{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator to ensure that the output of a function is converted to a string, handling Enum types specifically.",
  "sources": "The decorator wraps a function and calls it with arbitrary arguments, capturing the return value.",
  "sinks": "The use of force_str on the return value could potentially handle untrusted data, but in this context, it appears safe since it just converts data types to string.",
  "flows": "Input data (via wrapped function) flows into the decorator, which processes the output through type checking and force_str conversion.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed. The code is straightforward and does not perform any network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a decorator that ensures function output is a string, converting Enum values appropriately. It relies on Django's force_str, which is a safe utility for string conversion. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code is standard and limited to type handling and conversion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for type normalization, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
