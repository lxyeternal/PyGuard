  "purpose": "A decorator function designed to ensure the return value of a function is a string, with special handling for Enum instances.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the wrapped function (*args, **kwargs), and the return value of the wrapped function.",
  "sinks": "The return statement of the wrapper, which converts the result to a string using force_str.",
  "flows": "The wrapped function's output is processed; if it is an Enum, its value is extracted and converted to string, otherwise the output is directly converted to string.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Usage of force_str is standard in Django for encoding strings.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that wraps any function, converting its output to a string, with specific handling for Enum types. It imports necessary modules, defines the decorator, and inside the wrapper function, it calls the original function, checks if the result is an Enum, and applies force_str accordingly. No external data sources, network calls, or suspicious code are present. No obfuscated patterns or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility decorator for string conversion, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or security vulnerabilities based on the provided snippet.",
