{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling protected object errors in Django REST Framework, providing standardized error codes and messages.",
  "sources": "The 'msg' parameter passed to the constructor, used in 'force_str' to generate the exception detail.",
  "sinks": "The 'detail' attribute, which may be rendered in error responses; potential for message injection if 'msg' is untrusted and rendered without sanitization.",
  "flows": "Input 'msg' -> 'force_str(msg)' -> 'self.detail' -> error response rendering.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'force_str' on 'msg' is standard; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected. No external data sources or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes inheriting from Django and DRF components, handling messages safely via 'force_str'. No external data sources, network calls, or malicious patterns are present. The 'msg' parameter is used in a typical manner for exception messages, with no evidence of malicious intent or security flaws. The use of standard libraries and practices indicates a safe implementation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes in Django, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are accurate and should remain at zero for malware and risk, with high confidence in this assessment.",
