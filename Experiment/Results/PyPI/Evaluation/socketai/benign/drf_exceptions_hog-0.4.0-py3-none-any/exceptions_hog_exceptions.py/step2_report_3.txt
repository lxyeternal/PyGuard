  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- Defines a base exception class `ExceptionClass` with methods to retrieve error codes.\n- Defines a specialized exception `ProtectedObjectException` inheriting from `ExceptionClass` and Django's `ProtectedError`.\n- Uses standard Django/DRF utilities (`force_str`, `gettext_lazy`) for message handling and internationalization.\n- The constructor converts the message to a string with `force_str` and initializes the parent class.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No, the code is straightforward, standard for Django exception handling, and no issues are evident.\n\n### Logical and Security Flaws:\n- **Potential security concern:**  \n  The `msg` parameter is used directly in `force_str(msg or self.default_detail)`. If `msg` is derived from untrusted input, converting it to a string is safe, but it could potentially lead to message injection if the message is later rendered unsanitized in a user interface. However, this is a common pattern, and unless the message is directly displayed without escaping, it doesn't pose a significant risk.\n\n- **Malicious behavior or backdoors?**  \n  No. The code does not perform any network access, file operations, code execution, or data exfiltration.\n\n### Scores and Reasoning:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity or payloads)\n- **Security risk:** 0 (standard exception handling, no evident vulnerabilities)\n\nThe reports consistently assign zero scores for malware and obfuscation, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n### Potential Discrepancies:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as standard exception handling with no malicious intent.\n- The only minor point is the use of `force_str` on `msg`, which could be a concern if `msg` is untrusted and later rendered unsanitized, but in typical Django exception handling, this is acceptable.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious activity.\n- No need to adjust scores; they are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just noting potential for message injection if messages are rendered insecurely, but this is a standard pattern)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, well-structured exception class implementation with no security issues or malicious intent. The scores given in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.",
