  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling protected object errors in Django REST Framework applications.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from exception message 'msg' passed during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'force_str' to convert 'msg' to string, which could be unsafe if 'msg' is maliciously crafted; the class inherits from 'ProtectedError' and 'ExceptionClass', but no dangerous operations are directly performed.",
  "flows": "Input 'msg' flows through 'force_str' to 'self.detail', then to super().__init__.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious code behavior or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes with class variables for error codes and status. During initialization, it converts 'msg' to string using 'force_str', which is a safe operation when handling exception messages. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious activities. It primarily manages exception details in a Django context. No anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for custom exception handling in Django REST Framework, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be safe and straightforward.",
