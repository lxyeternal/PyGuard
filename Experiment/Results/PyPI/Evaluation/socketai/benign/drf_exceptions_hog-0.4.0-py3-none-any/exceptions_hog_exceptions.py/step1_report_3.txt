{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling protected object errors in Django REST Framework applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input via the constructor parameter 'msg' and the 'protected_objects' parameter. It also uses imported functions like force_str and gettext_lazy.",
  "sinks": "The 'detail' attribute is set using force_str on the input 'msg' or a default message, which could be influenced if 'msg' is untrusted. No other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'msg' flows into the 'detail' attribute after being processed by force_str, potentially from untrusted sources. No other data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The code uses standard Django and DRF practices. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes that extend Django and DRF classes. It handles error messaging in a typical manner. 'force_str' is used to ensure the message is a string, which is standard. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected. The constructor uses input 'msg' directly after processing, but 'msg' is a typical error message parameter. The code is clean, well-structured, and follows common patterns without signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exception handling in a Django/DRF environment. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as intended for error reporting with no suspicious activity.",
