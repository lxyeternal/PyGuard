{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling protected object errors in a Django REST Framework application.",
  "sources": "Reads input from constructor parameters and uses imported Django and DRF functions and classes.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'force_str' to process messages, which could potentially handle untrusted input if 'msg' is derived from user input.",
  "flows": "Constructor receives 'msg' and 'protected_objects', 'detail' is set with 'force_str' applied to 'msg' or default detail.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network or file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exception classes inheriting from Django and DRF components. It includes a method for retrieving error codes. The constructor converts the message to a string with 'force_str', which is standard for error message handling. There are no external data fetches, network operations, or code execution mechanisms. No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code evaluation, and no apparent backdoors or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of custom exception handling in a Django project, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It safely manages error messages and exception inheritance without any suspicious activity.",
