  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines custom exception classes for Django REST framework, with no external data sources, no suspicious sinks, and no anomalies. It correctly handles exceptions and uses standard libraries.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward and safe. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe handling of exception messages, with no suspicious operations.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is accurate; no malicious activity or security concerns. The scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights that 'msg' is passed into the constructor and converted with 'force_str', which is standard. No suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — safe handling.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct reasoning; no issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes that 'msg' can come from untrusted sources but is handled via 'force_str', which is standard practice. No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The potential concern about untrusted input is mitigated by 'force_str', which safely converts to string. No security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is standard, with no suspicious patterns, no external data flow, and proper use of Django conventions.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The conclusion is consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely defining exception classes.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear and standard; no obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Given the analysis, the risk score should be 0, as there are no security vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or dangerous data flows.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions in Django, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The use of 'force_str' on 'msg' is appropriate and safe, even if 'msg' originates from untrusted sources, as it simply converts input to a string.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or code injection vectors are present.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, well-structured, and poses no security concerns. The reports' assessments are accurate, and the scores should reflect the absence of risks.",
