  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes in Django REST Framework, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n- The code primarily defines exception classes, handles messages safely via `force_str`, and does not perform any external operations, network calls, or data exfiltration.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected across all reports.\n- The only potential concern is the use of `force_str` on the `msg` parameter, which could, in theory, process untrusted input. However, since this is within an exception class meant to handle error messages, this is standard practice and not inherently dangerous.\n\n**Confirming the presence of issues:**\n\n- The code does not contain any actual vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious behavior.\n- The message handling is typical for exception classes; converting messages to strings with `force_str` is standard and safe in this context.\n- No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or external data leaks.\n\n**Scores review:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5; given the analysis, a score of 0 is justified, as no security risk is evident.\n\n**Justification for risk score:**\n\n- Since the code handles exceptions safely, with no external data fetching, no code execution, and no malicious patterns, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n- The only minor consideration is the handling of `msg` via `force_str`, but this is standard and does not introduce risk.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes in Django REST Framework, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.",
