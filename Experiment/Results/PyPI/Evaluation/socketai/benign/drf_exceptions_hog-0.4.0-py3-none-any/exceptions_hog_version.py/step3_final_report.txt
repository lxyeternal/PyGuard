  "purpose": "Define version information for the package using static string assignments.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static assignment of version strings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "None; the code only assigns static values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static assignments with no dynamic or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static version string to two variables, with no inputs, outputs, dynamic execution, or external dependencies. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration snippet with no malicious intent or security concerns. The current assessments and scores are accurate and justified. No further action or concern is necessary.",
