  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths, as there are only variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static string values to version-related variables. It does not process input, perform any computations, or include external data sources. There are no functions, I/O operations, or code execution elements present. The code is straightforward, typical of version declaration, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply declares version variables without any malicious behavior or security concerns. It appears to be benign.",
