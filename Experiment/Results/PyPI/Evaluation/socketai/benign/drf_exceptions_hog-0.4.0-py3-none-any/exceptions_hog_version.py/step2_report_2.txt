  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Verification**  \nAll reports reference the same code snippet:  \n```python\n__version__ = \"0.4.0\"\nCLIENT_VERSION = __version__\n```  \nThis code is a straightforward assignment of a static version string to two variables. There are no functions, no input/output, no external data sources, and no dynamic code execution. The code's purpose is clearly to define version information.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**  \n- **Issues in the code?** No. The code is benign and typical for version declaration in Python packages.  \n- **Malicious code or suspicious behavior?** No. All reports confirm the absence of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.  \n- No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.  \n- The scoring of malware (0) and security risk (0) aligns with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Score Justifications and Recommendations**  \n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate; no malicious activity is present.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and unobfuscated.  \n- **Security risk score:** 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are detected.\n\n5. **Potential for Changes in Scores**  \n- Since all assessments agree and are accurate, there is no need to adjust scores.  \n- If anything, one might consider that the code is trivial and carries no security risk, so the scores are appropriate.\n\n6. **Overall Risk and Malware Assessment**  \n- The code is purely declarative, with no malicious intent or behavior.  \n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code snippet is a standard version declaration, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent, and no changes are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain component is benign and poses no security threat.",
