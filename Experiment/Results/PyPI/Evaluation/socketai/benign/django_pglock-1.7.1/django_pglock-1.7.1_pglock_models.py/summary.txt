  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, purpose-specific implementation for PostgreSQL lock management within a Django environment. It exhibits no malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk is low, primarily due to controlled dynamic SQL construction. The malware score is 0, obfuscated 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, which is appropriate given the context."
