{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'django-pglock' package using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "metadata.version('django-pglock')",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code does not send data externally or perform insecure actions.",
  "flows": "The code reads package metadata and assigns it to __version__; no external data flow or output manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code straightforwardly retrieves package version info without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the metadata module from importlib, then calls metadata.version with a package name. This is a common and safe practice to obtain package version info. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The code is minimal and standard for version retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign and standard implementation to obtain package version information. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
