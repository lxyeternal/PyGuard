  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'django-pglock' package using importlib.metadata",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version via metadata.version('django-pglock')",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to potential data leaks or untrusted code execution are present",
  "flows": "The source (metadata.version call) assigns data to __version__, but this data is not used in any vulnerable way",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are detected in this short code snippet",
  "analysis": "The code imports the standard library module 'importlib.metadata' and calls its version function to get the version of a specific package. This is a common, safe operation. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are involved. The code does not contain any obfuscation, malicious instructions, or suspicious behaviors. It simply retrieves package metadata information.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a safe, standard operation to retrieve package version information without any malicious intent or security issues.",
