  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'django-pglock' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package metadata to get version info using importlib.metadata.version.",
  "sinks": "The data retrieved is stored in the __version__ variable; no sink involves untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "The source (metadata.version call) flows directly into the __version__ variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports the importlib.metadata module, then retrieves the version of the specified package, 'django-pglock'. There are no user inputs, environment variables, or network operations. The purpose appears to be to programmatically access package version information, common in version management or compatibility checks. No malicious or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign operation of fetching package metadata. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks in this snippet.",
