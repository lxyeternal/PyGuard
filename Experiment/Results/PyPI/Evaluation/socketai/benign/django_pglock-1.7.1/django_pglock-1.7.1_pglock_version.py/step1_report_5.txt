  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'django-pglock' package using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "The call to metadata.version('django-pglock') which reads the package's metadata information.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leaks present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing the metadata module to calling metadata.version, which then assigns the result to __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code performs a straightforward metadata retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata to obtain version info for 'django-pglock'. It then assigns this version string to __version__. This is a common pattern in Python packages for version tracking. No user input, no network operations, and no suspicious code are present. The code is minimal and functional, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply retrieves and stores the version of the 'django-pglock' package, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
