  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Functionality and Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is straightforward: it imports `importlib.metadata` and retrieves the version of `'django-pglock'` using `metadata.version()`.\n   - The code assigns this version to `__version__`, which is a common pattern for version tracking.\n   - There are no indications of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - No external inputs, network calls, or data sinks are involved.\n   - Based on the code snippet, there are no issues or vulnerabilities present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they all describe the code as benign and standard.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The analysis correctly states that the code performs a simple, safe operation.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The `confidence` is 1, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No risk scores are above 0.5; all are zero, aligning with the benign assessment.\n   - If any scores were higher, we would need to justify them, but in this case, none are.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious activity.\n   - The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a simple version retrieval.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- While the code is benign, in a real-world scenario, retrieving package version info is common and generally safe.\n- If this code were part of a larger application, ensuring the package name `'django-pglock'` is trusted would be important, but based solely on this snippet, there's no issue.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's benign and straightforward purpose.",
