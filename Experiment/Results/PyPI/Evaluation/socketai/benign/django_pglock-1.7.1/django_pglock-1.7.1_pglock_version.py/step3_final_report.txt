  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the installed 'django-pglock' package using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "The call to metadata.version('django-pglock') reads the installed package's metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The source (metadata.version call) assigns data to __version__, with no further data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and performs a common operation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata and retrieves the version of 'django-pglock'. It performs a read-only operation with no user input, network activity, or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe pattern for retrieving package version info. There are no security risks or malicious behaviors present. The scores are justified and should remain unchanged.",
