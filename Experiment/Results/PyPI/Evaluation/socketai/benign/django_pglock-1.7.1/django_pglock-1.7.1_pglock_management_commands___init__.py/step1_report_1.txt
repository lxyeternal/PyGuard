{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, it is unclear.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from environment variables, input functions, and possibly external modules or files.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, network sockets, or outputs via print statements; some use of environment variables may be involved.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or input functions flows into processing functions, and then possibly outputs or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation. Some dynamic code execution or eval usage should be checked, but none are evident from the fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward with standard library usage. No suspicious network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors are detected. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or anomalies in control flow. Absence of hardcoded secrets or suspicious input/output handling. The structure and content seem typical for a utility script.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with standard operations. The confidence score is high given the limited scope of the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
