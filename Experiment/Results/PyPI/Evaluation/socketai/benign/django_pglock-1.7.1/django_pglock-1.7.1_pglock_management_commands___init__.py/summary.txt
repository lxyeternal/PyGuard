  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their scores. Benign reports have low malware and obfuscation scores, while Report 4's high scores are justified by suspicious behaviors. Slightly lowering security risk in benign reports from 0.2 to 0.1 could improve accuracy, but current scores are reasonable."
