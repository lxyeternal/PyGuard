  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; reports are summaries without code snippets.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign or insufficient data, with scores reflecting low suspicion. Report 4 shows signs of obfuscation and malicious indicators, justified by high scores. Minor adjustments to security risk scores for benign reports (1 and 3) could be considered but are acceptable as-is.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their scores. Benign reports have low malware and obfuscation scores, while Report 4's high scores are justified by suspicious behaviors. Slightly lowering security risk in benign reports from 0.2 to 0.1 could improve accuracy, but current scores are reasonable.",
