{
  "purpose": "The code is a Django management command designed to display and manage database locks, particularly PostgreSQL locks, with options for filtering, displaying, and cancelling or terminating locks.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments, environment variables accessed indirectly via config.get(), and user input through the input() function.",
  "sinks": "Sinks include system calls like sys.exit(), stdout.write(), and input(). No direct or indirect network communication, file system modification, or system commands execution are observed.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line arguments and user prompts influences control flow; data flows from database querysets through filtering, ordering, and formatting before being output to stdout. User confirmation responses influence execution paths for lock management.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The code performs standard management tasks: querying, filtering, and outputting data. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Django management command with standard argument parsing, database querying, and user interaction. It fetches lock information, filters, orders, and displays them, with options to cancel or terminate locks based on user confirmation. All data handling and control flow are consistent with normal application logic. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoor access are evident. The use of regular expressions for user confirmation is straightforward. The code leverages Django ORM methods securely and does not execute untrusted code or shell commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate database lock management tool with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It follows standard patterns for command-line interface and database operations. There is no evidence of malware or security risks within this module.",
