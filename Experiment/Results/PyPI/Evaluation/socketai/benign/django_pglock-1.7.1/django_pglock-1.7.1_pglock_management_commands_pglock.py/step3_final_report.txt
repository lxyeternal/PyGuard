  "purpose": "A Django management command for viewing and managing PostgreSQL locks, including options to cancel or terminate locks with user confirmation prompts.",
  "sources": "User input via input(), environment variables (via config), database querysets fetching lock data, stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "stdout.write() for displaying information, input() for user prompts, sys.exit() for terminating execution.",
  "flows": "User input influences control flow for lock cancellation/termination; database querysets fetch lock data; output formatting displays lock info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity, no code injection, no malicious backdoors or sabotage signals.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django CLI command managing PostgreSQL locks. It uses typical Python and Django ORM features, with user prompts validated via regex. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. It performs safe database queries, outputs information, and prompts for user confirmation before destructive actions. No network activity, file modifications, or obfuscated code are detected. The use of sys.exit() and input() is typical for CLI tools. The security posture is low risk, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe management utility for PostgreSQL locks, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation. The existing assessment scores are appropriate. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2). It poses no supply chain security threat.",
