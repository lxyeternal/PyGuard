{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Django management command to show and manage PostgreSQL database locks, including cancelling or terminating blocking queries.",
  "sources": "User input via the 'input()' function, command-line arguments, environment variables indirectly through 'config.get()', database querysets (models.BlockedPGLock, models.PGLock), and system calls like 'os.get_terminal_size()'.",
  "sinks": "User prompts for confirmation ('input()'), writing output via 'stdout.write()', terminating the process with 'sys.exit(1)'.",
  "flows": "User input from 'input()' influences control flow; command-line options affect querysets and logic; database querysets fetch lock data; user responses determine whether locks are cancelled or terminated, then output is generated accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of raw 'input()' prompts without sanitization is typical; no evidence of hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code features; no hidden network connections or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages database locks through user prompts and command-line arguments. It uses standard Python and Django features for querying and displaying lock data. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling is evident. User inputs are used for control flow but are handled via regex matching without dangerous code execution. The code performs data display and control commands safely. No external network or system modifications are present. The only potential concern is reliance on user input prompts for critical operations, but this is a standard management pattern and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django management command for lock management with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It reads user input and outputs information securely, without any suspicious activities or malware indicators.",
