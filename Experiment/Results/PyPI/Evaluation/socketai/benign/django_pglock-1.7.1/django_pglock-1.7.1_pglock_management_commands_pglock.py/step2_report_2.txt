  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a Django management command for PostgreSQL lock management.\n- User input is via `input()`, and output via `stdout.write()`.\n- No network activity, file modifications, or system calls beyond process termination (`sys.exit()`).\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.\n- The code performs database querying, filtering, displaying, and optional lock cancellation/termination.\n- No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in code:\n- **User input via `input()`** is standard for CLI tools, but it can be risky if not sanitized. Here, input is validated with regex `^(y)(es)?$`, which is acceptable.\n- **`sys.exit(1)`** is used to terminate the process upon user abort, which is normal.\n\n**No actual malicious or suspicious code features are present.**\n\n---\n\n### Specific report assessments:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Accurate, no malicious behavior, standard logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identifies no malicious activity.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- Also consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 (slightly lower, reflecting confidence in safety).\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- Same as above, with similar reasoning.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- Similar findings, consistent with others.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign `0`. The code does not perform any malicious activity—no network, no data exfiltration, no backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All `0`. The code is clear, standard Python/Django code.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero but low, reflecting that the code interacts with critical systems (database locks), but only through standard, safe practices. The risk is low, and the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### My independent estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — clear, standard code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, primarily due to user prompts and process termination, which are standard in CLI tools.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed; the code appears safe and legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard management command with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware and obfuscated scores correctly reflect the code's transparency.",
