{
  "purpose": "The script provides a command-line interface for managing and displaying database locks related to PostgreSQL, with options to cancel or terminate activities, filter, and format output.",
  "sources": "Input is gathered from command-line arguments, environment configuration, and user prompts; no external untrusted data sources are directly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are written to stdout; user inputs are read via input(); no data is sent over network or written to files; no database modifications occur directly within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from command-line args and configuration into database querysets; user prompts influence control flow for cancellations; data is formatted and outputted to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. Usage of regex for input validation is standard; no unsafe code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles database lock management through Django ORM, with user prompts for confirmation on actions like cancel or terminate locks. It carefully constructs querysets, formats output, and prompts for user input. No external network operations, system modifications, or obfuscated code are present. The logic appears to be standard for command-line tools, with appropriate safeguards like user confirmation and clean data formatting. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage are found. The code does not include or invoke any malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate management tool for PostgreSQL locks, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It operates within expected parameters for such a utility, with standard user interaction and database querying. No malicious or supply chain sabotage signals are detected.",
