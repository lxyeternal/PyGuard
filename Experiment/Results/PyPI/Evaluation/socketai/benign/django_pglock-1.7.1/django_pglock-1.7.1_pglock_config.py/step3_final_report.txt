{
  "purpose": "Provides access to PGLOCK-related configuration settings within a Django application, with defaults and override capabilities.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from django.conf.settings, specifically PGLOCK_* settings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only retrieves configuration data without processing external input or performing unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from django.conf.settings into local variables and return values; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility for accessing configuration settings with defaults and validation. It does not execute dynamic code, perform network operations, or handle untrusted input. The functions use standard Django patterns to retrieve settings, with optional overrides. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The minimal security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration access pattern with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent across reports. The slight elevation of risk to 0.1 in one report is unnecessary; it should be set to 0 to reflect the safe, controlled nature of configuration retrieval.",
