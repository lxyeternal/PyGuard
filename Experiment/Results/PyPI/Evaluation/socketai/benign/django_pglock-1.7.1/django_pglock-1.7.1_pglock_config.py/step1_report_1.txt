{
  "purpose": "Provide access to configuration settings related to PGLOCK within a Django application.",
  "sources": "Reading from django.conf.settings for PGLOCK_ATTRIBUTES, PGLOCK_BLOCKING_ATTRIBUTES, PGLOCK_CONFIGS, PGLOCK_LIMIT.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; configuration values are fetched from Django settings, which are controlled at deployment.",
  "flows": "Configuration data is fetched from settings, possibly overridden by function parameters, then returned for use.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code cleanly retrieves configuration values from Django settings, allowing optional overrides. It performs validation to ensure config names are valid and provides default values. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code’s logic is straightforward, mainly for configuration management. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration access pattern with no malicious intent or security concerns. It safely reads and manages settings without executing untrusted code or leaking data.",
