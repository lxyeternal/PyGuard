{
  "purpose": "Provide access to configuration settings related to PostgreSQL locking attributes and limits within a Django application.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from Django's settings module, specifically 'PGLOCK_ATTRIBUTES', 'PGLOCK_BLOCKING_ATTRIBUTES', 'PGLOCK_CONFIGS', and 'PGLOCK_LIMIT'.",
  "sinks": "The code updates and retrieves configuration dictionaries and does not perform any unsafe operations, data leaks, or insecure actions.",
  "flows": "Configurations are fetched from settings, possibly overridden via function parameters, and defaulted if absent. No untrusted input directly influences data flow, except via the provided function parameters which are assumed controlled by the application.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code strictly accesses configuration data and performs standard data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code safely retrieves configuration settings from Django's settings module, with fallback defaults. It provides functions to access attributes, blocking attributes, configs, and limits. The 'get' function allows for optional overrides and ensures default values are set. All data flows are internal, and there is no indication of malicious or insecure behavior. There are no hardcoded secrets, unsafe code execution, or data leaks. The code appears to be a standard configuration access pattern in a Django project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, secure configuration access module without any malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It follows good practices for fetching and overriding settings in a Django application.",
