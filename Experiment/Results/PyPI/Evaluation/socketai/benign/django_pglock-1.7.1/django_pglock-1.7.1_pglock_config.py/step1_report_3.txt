{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to access and manage configuration settings related to PostgreSQL locking attributes within a Django application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from Django settings attributes: PGLOCK_ATTRIBUTES, PGLOCK_BLOCKING_ATTRIBUTES, PGLOCK_CONFIGS, PGLOCK_LIMIT, and arbitrary overrides passed to the get() function.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies configuration dictionaries via cfg.update(), but does not write or execute untrusted data directly. No external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The get() function retrieves configurations from settings, applies overrides, and returns a configuration dictionary. Data flows from settings and overrides into configuration objects used elsewhere in the application.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code follows standard configuration management practices and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code safely accesses configuration data from Django settings with fallback defaults. It validates configuration names and allows controlled overrides. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, unsafe SQL, or environment variable misuse. It appears to be a standard configuration utility for a Django project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration helper with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It securely manages application settings without exposing sensitive data or executing untrusted code.",
