  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code provides functions to access configuration settings related to PGLOCK in a Django application.\n- It retrieves settings from `django.conf.settings`, with default values.\n- The `get()` function allows optional overrides, validates config names, and sets defaults for 'limit' and 'attributes'.\n- There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks.\n- The code is straightforward, primarily for configuration management.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No issues found; the code is standard configuration access.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no concerns.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Correct; no issues.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior; safe configuration access.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low, possibly due to the general nature of configuration code)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Verdict:** The slight security risk score seems reasonable given the code's role, but it's not indicative of actual vulnerability or malicious intent.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; no malicious activity or suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others; no issues.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None. The code only reads configuration data from Django settings.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** The minimal risk scores (like 0.1 in report 3) are acceptable given the context; configuration access is generally low risk.\n\n### **Final Justification:**\n- The code is a standard configuration utility.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted user input.\n- The low security risk score in report 3 is justified, considering the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (safe configuration access with no vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that.",
