{
  "purpose": "Provides access to configuration settings related to 'PGLOCK' features, such as attributes, blocking attributes, configs, and limits, primarily for use within a Django application.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from Django's settings module, specifically attributes like PGLOCK_ATTRIBUTES, PGLOCK_BLOCKING_ATTRIBUTES, PGLOCK_CONFIGS, PGLOCK_LIMIT, and dynamic retrieval via get().",
  "sinks": "Uses retrieved settings to generate configuration dictionaries; no direct data sinks or output destinations that could be exploited are evident.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are read from settings, optionally overridden through function parameters, and assembled into dictionaries for further use; no external data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. The code primarily accesses configuration data and performs straightforward operations without complex or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code safely accesses configuration data from Django settings without executing untrusted code or handling external input directly. It employs standard pattern of getting attributes with defaults and allows overrides for certain parameters. There is no evidence of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. The functions are well-structured, primarily for configuration management, with validation on config names in 'get()'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration accessor module with no malicious intent or security risks. It reads and manages application settings securely without processing untrusted input or executing code that could be exploited.",
