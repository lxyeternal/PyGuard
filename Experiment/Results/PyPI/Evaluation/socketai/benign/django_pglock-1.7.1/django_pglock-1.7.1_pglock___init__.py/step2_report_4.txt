  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is a straightforward re-export of constants and functions from 'pglock'. No external input, network activity, or suspicious logic.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code imports and re-exports 'pglock' symbols, with no external input or suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, likely due to the module's nature.\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code is a simple interface module.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—imports and exports, no dynamic code or external data handling.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no security issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard import/export module.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a straightforward re-export of 'pglock' symbols.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Code presence of issues:** None detected; all reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports correctly note the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All are either 0 or very low, consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** Confirmed as 0.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, given the code's benign, static nature.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is a standard module exposing constants and functions from a library, with no dynamic or external data processing.\n- No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate. The code is safe, with no malware or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
