{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports constants, functions, and variables related to PostgreSQL locking mechanisms and version info, likely for use in a larger database management or locking system.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pglock.core' and 'pglock.version'; no external or untrusted input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly imports and re-exports definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and primarily consists of import/export statements with no obfuscated or unusual code constructs. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports various constants, functions, and variables from external 'pglock' modules and re-exports them. It includes a version import and an __all__ list for exports. There are no functions executing dynamic code, no input handling, no network operations, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to serve as a module interface, exposing locking constants and functions for use elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import/export pattern for a PostgreSQL locking library, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It functions as a simple interface without any risky operations.",
