  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code re-exports constants, functions, and classes from 'pglock' for database lock management.\n- **Findings:** No untrusted data, no dynamic code, no obfuscation, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified, since it's a straightforward re-export module.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Defines and exports PostgreSQL locking constants and version info.\n- **Findings:** No external input, no network operations, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 — very low, perhaps considering the module's potential to be misused if imported maliciously, but no actual malicious code present.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, just a simple interface module.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Imports lock constants and functions, then exposes them.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic code, no input handling, standard pattern.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Imports and exports PostgreSQL lock-related constants/functions.\n- **Findings:** Straightforward import/export, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Imports and exposes 'pglock' components and 'timedelta'.\n- **Findings:** No dynamic execution, no input handling, standard pattern.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple re-export module with no malicious or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** No significant errors. The only minor note is that the low security risk score in report 2 might be slightly conservative, but given the absence of actual malicious code, it's acceptable.\n- **Scores consistency:** All scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Malware justification:** All malware scores are 0, which is correct.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n**Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and static.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and well-justified. The code is a benign module for re-exporting constants and functions from the 'pglock' library, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
