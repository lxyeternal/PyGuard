{
  "purpose": "This code imports and exposes constants, functions, and variables from the 'pglock' library for managing PostgreSQL locks, as well as the 'timedelta' class from the 'datetime' module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pglock.core', 'pglock.version', and 'datetime' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data processing or output are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve importing modules and re-exporting symbols, with no processing of external input or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code appears to be a straightforward module re-export of library components.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports specific symbols from external libraries and modules, then re-exports them in the '__all__' list for public API exposure. There are no functions, data processing, or external data handling. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to serve as a wrapper or facade for the 'pglock' library functionalities, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import and export module, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply exposes certain constants and functions from 'pglock' for external use, and does not perform any operations that could harm or leak data.",
