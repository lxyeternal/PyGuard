{
  "purpose": "The code defines and exports constants, functions, and variables related to PostgreSQL locking mechanisms, version info, and timeouts for use in a larger database management context.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pglock.core' and 'pglock.version' modules, as well as the hardcoded list '__all__'. No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs identified. No operations that process untrusted input or lead to data leaks or external system effects.",
  "flows": "The module imports functions and constants, then aggregates and exposes them via '__all__'. There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual logic detected. The code appears straightforward and standard for a Python module.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports constants, functions, and variables from external modules related to PostgreSQL locking mechanisms, and then exports these via the '__all__' list for use elsewhere. There are no dynamic code execution, input handling, or suspicious patterns. The structure and content are typical for a module defining API exports. No signs of malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module for exporting PostgreSQL lock-related constants and functions. It does not contain any malicious code, security risks, or obfuscated segments. The risk level is negligible.",
