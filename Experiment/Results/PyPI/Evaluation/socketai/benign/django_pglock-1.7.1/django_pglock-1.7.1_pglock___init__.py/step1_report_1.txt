{
  "purpose": "This module re-exports constants, functions, and classes from the 'pglock' package for use in database lock management.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pglock.core' and 'pglock.version', including constants, functions, and version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications; purely re-exporting imported symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external or untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only internal re-exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors observed. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various lock constants and functions from the 'pglock' library, then exposes them via __all__ for module consumers. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or include any code that could be malicious. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The imports are static, and there is no dynamic code execution or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for re-exporting symbols from the 'pglock' package, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
