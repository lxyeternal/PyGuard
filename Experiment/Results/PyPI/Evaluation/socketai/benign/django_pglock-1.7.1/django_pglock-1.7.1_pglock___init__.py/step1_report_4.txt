{
  "purpose": "The code defines and imports various constants, functions, and classes related to database locking mechanisms and advisory functions, and sets module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pglock.core' and 'pglock.version', and the module's own variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "The code flows from import statements to defining __all__ for module exports; no data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated constructs, or hardcoded secrets, is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a set of predefined constants and functions from a package named 'pglock', which appears to be related to PostgreSQL locking. It then defines __all__ to specify what symbols are exported. The code is straightforward, with no logic, user input handling, or external data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that imports and exports specific constants and functions related to PostgreSQL locking mechanisms. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security vulnerabilities. It appears to be standard package boilerplate or API interface code.",
