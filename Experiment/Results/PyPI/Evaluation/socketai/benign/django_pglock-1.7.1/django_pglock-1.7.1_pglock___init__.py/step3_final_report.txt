{
  "purpose": "This code module imports various constants, functions, and classes from the 'pglock' package and re-exports them via the __all__ list to provide a public API interface.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'pglock.core' and 'pglock.version', and the 'timedelta' import from 'datetime'. No external or untrusted data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; the code only defines exports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply re-exports imported symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module that imports constants, functions, and classes from the 'pglock' package and exposes them via the __all__ list. It contains only static import statements and a list of exported symbols, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or input handling. The code serves as an API interface or wrapper, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a clean interface for 'pglock' functionalities. There are no indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk, reflecting its safe and static nature.",
