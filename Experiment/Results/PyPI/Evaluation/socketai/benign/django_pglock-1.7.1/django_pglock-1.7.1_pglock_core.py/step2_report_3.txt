  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code for any security issues, and evaluate the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows**: The report correctly identifies the code as providing PostgreSQL advisory lock utilities, with database commands and threading for background tasks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No suspicious activity, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: The assessment is sound; the code appears legitimate, with a high confidence score (0.95). Malware score 0, risk 0.1 aligns with the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict**: No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows**: Similar to Report 1, focusing on advisory lock management and process locking.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No malicious indicators; threading and SQL commands are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: Well-founded; the code is standard for concurrency control, with a high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0, risk 0.2 is appropriate.\n\n**Verdict**: No security concerns; scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows**: Focuses on advisory lock management, background threading for lock prioritization.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No suspicious activity or obfuscation. The threading for lock prioritization is typical.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: Valid assessment; no malicious behavior detected. Malware 0, risk 0.2 fit.\n\n**Verdict**: No issues; scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows**: Again, similar lock management functions, background threads for lock handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No malicious or suspicious activity; standard concurrency patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: Accurate; no security threats identified. Malware 0, risk 0.2 are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict**: No concerns; scores consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows**: Utility functions for advisory and table locks, background lock termination.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis**: No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious activity. Threading is used for background lock management, which is standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence**: Correct; no malicious intent. Malware 0, risk 0.2 are justified.\n\n**Verdict**: No security issues; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\n- **Code Confirmation**: The code snippets are consistent across reports, and no malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Errors/Flaws**: No logical flaws or errors are apparent; the code handles exceptions and validation properly.\n- **Scores Justification**:\n  - **Malware**: All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n  - **Obfuscated**: All are 0, matching the clear, readable code.\n  - **Risk**: Slightly higher (0.1-0.2) due to the potential misuse of background threads and lock management functions, but these are standard for such utilities.\n\n### Final Recommendation\n\n**Estimated scores based on the review:**\n\n- **Malware**: 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk**: 0.1–0.2 (low, inherent in lock management features but not malicious)\n\n**Conclusion**: The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility for PostgreSQL advisory and table locking in Django. No security threats or malicious behaviors are present. The scoring across reports aligns with the actual content and risk profile.\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No changes needed.",
