  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is solely for version detection of psycopg/psycopg2 and PostgreSQL server, using standard imports, attribute access, and exception handling.\n- No data processing, user input, or network operations are involved.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected.\n- The logic is straightforward and consistent with typical version validation routines.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly attempts to import either `psycopg` or `psycopg2`, retrieves version info, and validates supported versions.\n- **Security concerns:** No evidence of security risks, data leaks, or malicious activity.\n- **Malware:** Score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** Score is 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk:** The overall risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Scores assigned:** All reports give a malware score of 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk 0, which is justified.\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  - The scores are consistent with the analysis.  \n  - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), matching the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or errors in the report:\n\n- **No issues detected in the code.**  \n- **No anomalies or suspicious patterns.**  \n- **No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent.**  \n- **All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.**\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the code and the reports, I agree with the provided scores and conclusions. The code is a standard version check utility with no security risks or malware.\n\n**However,** to be thorough, I will assign my own estimated scores:\n\n| Metric             | My Estimate | Justification                                                                 |\n|--------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**       | 0            | No malicious activity or code detected.                                    |\n| **Obfuscated**    | 0            | Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                            |\n| **Risk**          | 0            | No security risk; purely informational version checks.                     |\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\n\n- The code appears safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- The scores in the reports are accurate and justified.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign version validation utility with no security or malware concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
