{
  "purpose": "To determine the version of psycopg2 or psycopg module and PostgreSQL server version",
  "sources": "Import statements, Database.__version__, cursor.connection.server_version or cursor.connection.info.server_version",
  "sinks": "None evident; the code primarily reads version info and raises exceptions if incompatible",
  "flows": "Imports -> Version retrieval -> Version parsing -> Returning version info",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import psycopg or psycopg2 modules, retrieves their version, and ensures compatibility. It raises exceptions if modules are missing or versions are unsupported. The function pg_maj_version extracts the PostgreSQL server version from the cursor connection object. No data exfiltration, remote code execution, or malicious logic detected. The code performs standard version checks relevant for database compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward version checking utility for psycopg and PostgreSQL, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any obfuscated or suspicious code segments.",
