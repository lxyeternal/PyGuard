{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to determine the version of the psycopg database adapter and the PostgreSQL server version for use within a Django application.",
  "sources": "The code reads the '__version__' attribute from the psycopg or psycopg2 module, and the 'server_version' attribute from the database connection object.",
  "sinks": "No sensitive data or untrusted inputs are directly used in critical security-sensitive sinks; the code primarily reads version information from trusted modules and objects.",
  "flows": "The version string from the psycopg module flows into 'get_version_tuple' to produce a version tuple; the server version information from the cursor object flows into the 'pg_maj_version' function, which parses and returns the major version number.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed; exception handling for module import errors is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads the psycopg or psycopg2 database adapter, retrieves its version, and verifies compatibility, raising exceptions if the module is missing or the version is unsupported. It then exposes a function to extract the PostgreSQL server's major version from a cursor object. All operations involve safe attribute access and standard version parsing. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code relies on trusted modules and well-understood APIs, with proper exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate version detection tasks within a Django environment without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no malware, suspicious obfuscation, or malicious data handling. Overall, it appears to be a standard utility module for database version management.",
