{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to determine the version of the psycopg PostgreSQL database adapter and the PostgreSQL server version in a Django environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version of the imported psycopg module and the server version through the cursor object.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted user input or data; the code only retrieves version information.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules, loads the psycopg version, and retrieves server version information through a cursor object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. Exception handling is standard; no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import psycopg or psycopg2, raises an exception if neither is available, and verifies the version is supported. It then provides a utility to get the PostgreSQL server's major version. All operations are read-only, with no data modification or untrusted data processing. Exception handling is straightforward and limited to import errors and version validation. The code does not perform any network operations, data leakage, or code execution beyond standard version retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version check for psycopg and PostgreSQL server, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and functional, primarily for ensuring compatibility.",
