{
  "purpose": "This code aims to determine the version of the psycopg PostgreSQL adapter and the PostgreSQL server version in a Django environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ attribute from the imported Database module and the server_version attribute from the database connection object.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, untrusted version strings could influence version checks or exception messages, but no external data flows directly into the code.",
  "flows": "The code imports the database module, retrieves its version, processes it, and returns version tuples; it also accesses database connection attributes to determine server version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior are present. The exception handling is standard, and no obfuscated code or hidden logic is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import either psycopg or psycopg2 modules and retrieve their version. It verifies if the major version is supported. It raises exceptions with messages if the modules cannot be loaded or the version is unsupported. The function pg_maj_version extracts the server version from the database connection object, assuming standard attribute access. No malicious or suspicious code is present; all operations are related to version detection. No external data injection or backdoors are evident. The code's structure and flow are straightforward, with no obfuscated logic or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard version detection for psycopg and PostgreSQL within a Django environment without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is a normal, security-appropriate utility code for version checking.",
