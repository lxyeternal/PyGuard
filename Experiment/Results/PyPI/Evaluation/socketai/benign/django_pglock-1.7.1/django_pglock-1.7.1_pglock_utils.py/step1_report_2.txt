{
  "purpose": "To determine the installed version of psycopg (PostgreSQL adapter) and the PostgreSQL server version in a Django environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ attribute from the psycopg Database module and the server_version attribute from the database connection object.",
  "sinks": "The version information is used internally for validation; no direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves version strings from imported modules and database connection objects, processes them, and raises exceptions if incompatible versions are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Exception handling is straightforward. No network or privacy-sensitive operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import the psycopg database adapter, first trying 'psycopg', then falling back to 'psycopg2'. It validates the version to ensure compatibility. The function pg_maj_version extracts the PostgreSQL server's major version from the connection object. All operations are standard version checks with exception handling. No external data sources, network operations, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs version checks and validation for psycopg and PostgreSQL, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical version validation snippet used in Django database integrations.",
