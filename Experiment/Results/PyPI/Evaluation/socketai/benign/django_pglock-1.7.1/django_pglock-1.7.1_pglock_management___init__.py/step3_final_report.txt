  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, encoded strings, dynamic execution points (eval, exec).",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, file writes, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via data processing functions, possibly through obfuscated or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, use of eval/exec, base64/hex encoded strings, misleading variable names, lack of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify benign code with no suspicious patterns, assigning low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 2 shows significant obfuscation and signs of concealment, warranting higher suspicion. Scores are generally consistent with the described code features. Slight adjustments are recommended: increasing malware score in Report 2 from 0.4 to 0.6, and risk from 0.45 to 0.5, to better reflect the obfuscation and potential malicious intent. Other reports' scores are appropriate given their benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The evaluations and scores are mostly justified and consistent with the code descriptions. Report 2's higher obfuscation warrants a slightly increased malware and risk score. Overall, the scoring aligns well with the evidence; minor adjustments improve accuracy.",
