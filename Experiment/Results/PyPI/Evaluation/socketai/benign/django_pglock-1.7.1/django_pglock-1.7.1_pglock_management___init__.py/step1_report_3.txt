  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module intended for general functionality, with no explicit comments indicating its purpose.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs include environment variables, user inputs via functions like input(), file reads, or network data (if any). However, no specific input sources are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, file writes, or evaluation/execution of code. No explicit sinks are visible in the code provided.",
  "flows": "Without explicit data flows or untrusted data sources and sinks, no clear source-to-sink paths are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected. The code does not perform dynamic code execution or obscure operations.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward Python script or module with standard syntax and structure. It does not include suspicious patterns such as dynamic execution, network activity, or embedded payloads. Since the code snippet is minimal or not provided, the assessment is based on observable features. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign and well-structured, with no anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
