The security risk is low, primarily due to controlled dynamic SQL construction. The malware score is 0, obfuscated 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.2, which is appropriate given the context."

The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent across reports. The slight elevation of risk to 0.1 in one report is unnecessary; it should be set to 0 to reflect the safe, controlled nature of configuration retrieval."

No modifications are necessary."

Slightly lowering security risk in benign reports from 0.2 to 0.1 could improve accuracy, but current scores are reasonable."
