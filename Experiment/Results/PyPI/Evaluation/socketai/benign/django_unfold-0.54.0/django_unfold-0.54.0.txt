      "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django pattern for replacing the admin site with a custom implementation. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. The minor security risk is due to global reassignment, which is typical in such customizations but could be risky if 'UnfoldAdminSite' is malicious. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and follows standard Django patterns. The main potential security risk arises if 'template_name' is influenced by untrusted input without validation, which could lead to template injection. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk is low but warrants validation of 'template_name' if set externally."

The use of Callable does not inherently indicate malicious intent in this context. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, and no adjustments are necessary."
