  "purpose": "Render UI sections based on Django model instances and request context, either as a table or a template fragment.",
  "sources": "Model instance attributes, related querysets, class attributes like 'template_name', and request object.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'render_to_string' with 'self.template_name' or context data, which could be used to generate output or templates.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model attributes and class properties into context for 'render_to_string', with potential influence from external sources if 'template_name' is set dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated code. The only potential concern is 'template_name' being set from untrusted input without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two classes for rendering UI components in Django: 'TableSection' renders a table from related querysets and specified fields, while 'TemplateSection' renders a template with the instance and request. Both utilize 'render_to_string' to generate HTML. The primary security consideration is that 'TemplateSection' uses 'self.template_name' directly, which could be set from untrusted sources, risking template injection if not validated. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard Django utilities. The main concern is ensuring 'template_name' is controlled or validated to prevent injection vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and follows standard Django patterns. The main potential security risk arises if 'template_name' is influenced by untrusted input without validation, which could lead to template injection. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk is low but warrants validation of 'template_name' if set externally.",
