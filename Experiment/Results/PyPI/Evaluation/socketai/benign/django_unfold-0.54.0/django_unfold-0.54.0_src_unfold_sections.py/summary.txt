  "conclusion": "The code is generally safe and follows standard Django patterns. The main potential security risk arises if 'template_name' is influenced by untrusted input without validation, which could lead to template injection. No malware or obfuscation detected. The overall security risk is low but warrants validation of 'template_name' if set externally."
