{
  "purpose": "The code extends Django admin checks to verify that certain actions with allowed_permissions attribute have corresponding permission methods defined in the ModelAdmin class.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes, method attributes, and calls methods such as _get_base_actions_list, _get_base_actions_detail, _get_base_actions_row, _get_base_actions_submit_line, and inspects method attributes like allowed_permissions.",
  "sinks": "The code potentially outputs errors via checks.Error, which could be displayed in admin interface or logs. No direct untrusted data handling or external data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "The flow is: gather actions from ModelAdmin methods, check for allowed_permissions attribute, construct method names, verify existence, and generate errors if missing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated code are present. The code performs standard class and method attribute inspections.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static inspection of Django ModelAdmin subclasses to ensure proper permission methods exist for actions with allowed_permissions attribute. It uses class attributes and method attributes, checks for method existence, and generates errors accordingly. The code appears to be a safeguard mechanism for admin permission consistency. No external data input or suspicious behaviors are detected. The overall structure and logic are standard for such validation and do not contain malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a security and correctness check for Django admin permissions. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The purpose is to enforce permission method definitions for actions with specified allowed_permissions. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
