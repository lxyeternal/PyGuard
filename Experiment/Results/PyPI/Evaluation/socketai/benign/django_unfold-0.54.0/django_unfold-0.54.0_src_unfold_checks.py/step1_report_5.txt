{
  "purpose": "The code extends Django admin checks to verify that permission methods are correctly implemented for custom admin actions, ensuring security and correctness of permissions.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes, method attributes, and a list of actions retrieved from the admin object via private methods.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks such as network communication, file writes, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves iterating over actions obtained from the admin object, checking for 'allowed_permissions' attribute, and verifying the existence of corresponding permission methods in the admin class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be a straightforward Django admin extension for permission validation.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a custom Django admin check class that verifies the presence of permission methods for actions with specified allowed permissions. It retrieves actions through private methods, iterates over them, and checks for attribute presence. The logic is standard for Django admin validation and does not involve external inputs, unsafe code execution, or data leaks. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code strictly enforces permission method existence to maintain admin action security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django admin validation extension focusing on permission method checks. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It serves a security purpose by ensuring proper permission method implementation.",
