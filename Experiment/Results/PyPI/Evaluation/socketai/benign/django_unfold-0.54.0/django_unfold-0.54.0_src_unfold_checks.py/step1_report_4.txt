  "purpose": "Custom Django admin checks to verify permission methods for actions with allowed_permissions attribute.",
  "sources": "obj._get_base_actions_list(), obj._get_base_actions_detail(), obj._get_base_actions_row(), obj._get_base_actions_submit_line(), action.method.allowed_permissions, hasattr(), getattr(), obj.__class__",
  "sinks": "append to errors list, checks.Error object creation",
  "flows": "Actions with allowed_permissions are checked; if corresponding permission methods are missing in obj, an error is generated",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed; code relies on standard Django admin check mechanisms and dynamic attribute checks",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Django's ModelAdminChecks to enforce that for actions with allowed_permissions, corresponding permission methods (has_<perm>_permission) exist in the admin class. It dynamically retrieves various action lists and iterates over each action, checking for the presence of allowed_permissions attribute and required methods. The process involves standard Python attribute checks and error reporting using Django's checks framework. No external data handling, insecure coding practices, or malicious behavior identified. The logic is straightforward, serving as a validation mechanism for permission method implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a security and correctness check for Django admin actions, ensuring necessary permission methods are defined. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and functions as intended for validation. No evidence of malware or security risks present.",
