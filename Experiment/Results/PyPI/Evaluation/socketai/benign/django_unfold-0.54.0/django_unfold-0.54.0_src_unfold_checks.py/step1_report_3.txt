  "purpose": "Enhance Django admin checks by validating custom action permission methods in ModelAdmin classes.",
  "sources": "Methods such as _get_base_actions_list, _get_base_actions_detail, _get_base_actions_row, _get_base_actions_submit_line; attribute access on action.method; hasattr checks; string formatting for method names.",
  "sinks": "hasattr checks on obj; attribute access and string formatting for dynamic method name creation; potential error reporting.",
  "flows": "Code reads action.method and its allowed_permissions attribute -> constructs method name -> checks for method existence -> reports errors if missing.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network or file operations. Use of dynamic attribute access is standard for such Django checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom Django admin check class that verifies the presence of permission methods for actions with specified allowed_permissions. It accesses multiple attributes and methods related to admin actions, constructs method names dynamically, and reports errors if required permission methods are missing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, external communication, or sabotage. The code relies on standard Django mechanisms and safe attribute access. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves a legitimate purpose of validating permission methods in Django admin actions. It performs standard checks without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The implementation appears safe and straightforward.",
