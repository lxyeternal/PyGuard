  "purpose": "Define and override Django model form fields with custom widgets for admin interface customization.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django modules, custom widgets, and optional external packages; usage of models and form classes to assign widgets.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; code primarily configures widget mappings for form fields without executing untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow detected; configuration mappings are static and not influenced by external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. The code strictly sets widget overrides based on field types. Use of optional external packages is safely guarded with try-except blocks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports Django modules, custom widgets, and optionally external packages. It creates dictionaries to override default form widgets for various Django model fields. The main dictionary 'FORMFIELD_OVERRIDES' is populated with mappings from model fields to custom widgets. It attempts to include additional field types from external packages ('django.contrib.postgres' and 'djmoney'), safely handling ImportError exceptions. It then creates a deep copy of the main override dictionary for inline forms and updates it with an extra widget for 'ImageField'. The code appears to be a configuration setup without executing any untrusted or dynamic code, and no network, file, or environment variable interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration for Django admin form field overrides using custom widgets, with safe handling of optional external dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
