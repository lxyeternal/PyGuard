{
  "purpose": "This code defines form field overrides for Django model fields to customize admin widgets, including optional support for PostgreSQL and Django Money fields.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django, unfold.widgets, and conditional imports for third-party packages (django.contrib.postgres, djmoney). It reads these modules to extend form override mappings.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns widgets to model fields in the FORMFIELD_OVERRIDES dictionaries. No direct data sinks, but potential concern if widget implementations handle untrusted input insecurely.",
  "flows": "Imports are used to extend widget mappings based on available modules. These mappings are then used in Django admin interfaces. No flow of untrusted data into sensitive sinks in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or dynamic code execution. Use of copy.deepcopy is standard. Conditional imports are safe, and the code appears to be configuration setup.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a mapping of Django model fields to custom widgets for admin forms. It includes conditional imports for optional packages, updating the mapping only if packages are available. No user input is processed or executed dynamically. The code is purely configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script for customizing Django admin widgets based on installed packages. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It is well-structured, with safe import handling. Overall, safe and benign.",
