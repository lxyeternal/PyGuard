{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom form field overrides for various Django model fields and related third-party extensions, mainly to specify custom widgets for admin forms.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported Django models, third-party fields, and widgets, as well as the module's own definitions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any direct data sinks; it mainly configures widget associations for form rendering.",
  "flows": "The flow is from model field definitions to the form widget customization via the FORMFIELD_OVERRIDES dictionary, with conditional imports for optional extensions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and involves standard form customization logic.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up mappings between Django model fields (including optional fields from extensions like django.contrib.postgres and djmoney) and custom widgets for admin forms. It uses safe practices such as conditional imports with try-except blocks, and there is no evidence of input handling or data manipulation. No hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or suspicious operations are present. The code appears to serve as configuration for form rendering, with no malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module for Django admin forms, specifying widget overrides for various fields. No malicious behavior or security threats are identified. The code's purpose is to enhance form UI, and it does not process untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
