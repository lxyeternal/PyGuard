{
  "purpose": "The code configures form field overrides for Django models to specify custom widgets for various field types, including optional integrations for PostgreSQL and djmoney fields.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules, the 'models' and 'forms' objects, and dynamically imports optional modules such as django.contrib.postgres.fields, django.contrib.postgres.search, and djmoney.models.fields.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to the 'FORMFIELD_OVERRIDES' and 'FORMFIELD_OVERRIDES_INLINE' dictionaries, which are used to map model fields to form widgets; no direct data sinks involving untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "The source data (imported modules and model definitions) flow into the FORMFIELD_OVERRIDES configuration, which then determines widget assignments for form fields during form rendering.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs conditional imports with exception handling, which is standard and not suspicious; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a mapping between Django model fields and custom form widgets, including optional imports for PostgreSQL and djmoney features. It uses deep copying for inline overrides and conditional imports with exception handling, which are standard practices. No user input, network operations, or sensitive data handling is evident. The structure is straightforward, focused solely on form configuration without executing any dynamic or malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code. It performs standard configuration tasks with safe coding practices. The code appears to be a benign part of a Django project setup.",
