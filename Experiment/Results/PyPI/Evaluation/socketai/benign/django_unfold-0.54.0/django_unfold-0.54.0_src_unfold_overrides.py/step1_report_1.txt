  "purpose": "Configure custom form widgets for Django model fields, including optional enhancements for PostgreSQL and Django Money.",
  "sources": "Imports from Django, unfold.widgets, and optional imports for PostgreSQL and Django Money; usage of models and forms modules; deepcopy of configuration dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; configuration data is used for form rendering. No untrusted input handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Imports lead to dictionary updates that map model fields to widget classes, used for form rendering in Django.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; code solely performs configuration of form widgets based on model fields and optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines widget overrides for various Django model fields, including conditional imports for optional modules like django.contrib.postgres and djmoney. It uses deep copies to extend existing configurations for inlines. No user input, external data, or suspicious logic is present. The code is purely configuration and does not execute untrusted data or include obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for Django admin forms, with safe handling of optional dependencies. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
