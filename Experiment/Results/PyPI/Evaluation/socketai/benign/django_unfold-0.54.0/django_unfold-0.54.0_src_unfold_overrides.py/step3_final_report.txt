  "purpose": "Configure Django admin form widgets for various model fields, including optional support for PostgreSQL extensions and djmoney, by mapping fields to custom widget classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Django models, forms, optional modules (django.contrib.postgres, djmoney), and the unfold.widgets module; the FORMFIELD_OVERRIDES dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing; the code only sets up static mappings for form rendering.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from module imports and dictionary updates to Django admin form rendering, with no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Use of try-except for optional modules is standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely configuration for Django admin form widgets, mapping model fields to custom widgets. It safely handles optional dependencies with try-except blocks. No dynamic code execution, untrusted input handling, or data sinks are present. The code does not perform any operations beyond static dictionary setup, indicating no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard configuration module for Django admin customization. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk code. The scores assigned by the initial reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and justified.",
