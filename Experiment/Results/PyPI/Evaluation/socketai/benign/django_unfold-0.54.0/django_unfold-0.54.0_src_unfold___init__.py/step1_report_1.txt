  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform data processing or utility functions, but the specific intent cannot be fully determined due to lack of context and minimal code provided.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules; exact sources are unclear without code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file operations, or system commands, but specifics are not evident from the provided fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be conclusively identified without explicit code; look for data handling that could lead to injection or leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are visible in the provided snippet. Lack of context limits detailed analysis.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of the actual code snippet, the review cannot identify specific source-to-sink flows, anomalies, or malicious patterns. The code appears minimal or incomplete, preventing definitive conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited information, no malicious behavior or significant security risks are evident. However, incomplete data prevents a thorough assessment. Additional code context is needed for a comprehensive review.",
