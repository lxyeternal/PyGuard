  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of dataclass definitions for UI-related components. It imports external modules but does not execute any dynamic or potentially malicious operations. No input handling, no data processing, and no external network or file interactions are present. The code appears to be straightforward, structural, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of data class definitions for UI components without any suspicious or malicious elements. It poses no security risks.",
