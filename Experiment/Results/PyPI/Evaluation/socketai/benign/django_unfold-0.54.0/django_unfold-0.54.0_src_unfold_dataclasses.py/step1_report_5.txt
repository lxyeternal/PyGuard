  "purpose": "Define data structures for actions, favicons, and dropdown items in a Python application.",
  "sources": "No external data sources are read; no input or data fetching occurs within this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious imports, or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple data class definitions that serve as models for UI actions and elements. It imports type hints and enum types but does not perform any data processing, input/output, or system calls. All imported modules are standard or project-specific and do not suggest malicious intent. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network communications, or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely structural, defining data containers for application logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The overall security assessment is that it is safe.",
