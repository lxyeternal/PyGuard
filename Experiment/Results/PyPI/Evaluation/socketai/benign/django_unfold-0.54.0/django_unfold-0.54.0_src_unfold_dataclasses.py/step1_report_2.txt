  "purpose": "Define data classes for actions, favicon, and dropdown items used in a larger application.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; code defines classes and imports modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code purely defines data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual or obfuscated code, no suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and project-specific modules to define data classes with fields and type annotations. All classes are simple data containers with no logic, no dynamic code execution, and no handling of external input. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The use of Callable types for 'href' and 'link' indicates flexibility, but does not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe and straightforward, serving as part of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines data structures without any malicious content or suspicious behavior. No security risks are present based on this snippet.",
