  "purpose": "Define data structures for UI actions, favicons, and dropdown items",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static class definitions",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external output",
  "flows": "N/A; static data classes only",
  "anomalies": "Use of Callable for href and link allows dynamic behavior but is common for UI callbacks",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of immutable and mutable data class definitions for UI components, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. The use of Callable types introduces flexibility but does not imply malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward and static, serving as data models without any dynamic or external code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and safe. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of Callable does not inherently indicate malicious intent in this context. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, and no adjustments are necessary.",
