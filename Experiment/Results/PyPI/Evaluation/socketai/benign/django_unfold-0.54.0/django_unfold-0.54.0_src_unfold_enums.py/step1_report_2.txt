{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different action variants used likely for UI or status indicators.",
  "sources": "The code reads the source of the Enum class definition and the string values assigned to each enum member.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs involving untrusted input or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external input to sensitive operations; the code only defines static constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a straightforward enumeration definition with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class from the enum module and defines a simple Enum class with string values representing different variants. There are no input sources, no data manipulation, and no sensitive operations. The purpose appears to be for categorizing or labeling states, typical in UI development. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign enumeration definition with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
