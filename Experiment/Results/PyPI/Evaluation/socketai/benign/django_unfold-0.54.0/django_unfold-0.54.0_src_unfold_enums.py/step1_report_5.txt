  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different action variants, likely used for UI styling or categorization.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; the code imports the Enum class from the enum module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations; no untrusted data handling or transmission.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares an enum class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, defining a simple enum without hidden or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class and defines an Enum 'ActionVariant' with several string members representing different UI action styles. The code appears to be a typical, benign enumeration used for categorizing or styling actions in a UI context. No external input, no data transmission, and no suspicious logic are present. The structure and syntax are standard and do not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign enumeration definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a simple, declarative data structure for UI styling purposes.",
