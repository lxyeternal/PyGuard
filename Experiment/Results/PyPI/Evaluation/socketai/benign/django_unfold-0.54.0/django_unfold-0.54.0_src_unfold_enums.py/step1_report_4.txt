  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for different action variants in a UI or system.",
  "sources": "Import of the Enum class from the enum module, definition of the ActionVariant class and its members.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "The code establishes a static enumeration; there are no data flows involving external input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class to define an enumeration ActionVariant with six string members representing different UI states or action types. There are no dynamic or external inputs, no data processing, and no network or file operations. The code appears to serve a purely definitional purpose without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard enumeration definition with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not read untrusted data, nor does it perform any operations that could be exploited.",
