{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration 'ActionVariant' with six string members representing different action styles or statuses.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static enum declaration.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external output or data flow.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward enum declaration with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Enum' from the 'enum' module and declares a class 'ActionVariant' inheriting from 'Enum', with six string members. It contains no input/output, dynamic behavior, or external interactions. The code is simple, clear, and standard, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static enum declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
