  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Presence & Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class declaration inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - The class is empty, serving solely as a custom exception type.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious constructs.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores**:\n   - Since the code is purely a class declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior, the malware score should remain 0.\n   - The security risk score should also be 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or risky constructs.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they focus solely on the code provided.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nThe code is a straightforward, benign class definition for a custom exception. All reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's characteristics.\n\n**No further action needed.**",
