  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code is a simple class declaration inheriting from Exception, with no additional logic, data, or external interactions. There are no input/output operations, no data flows, and no suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify this.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly note that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. No flaws or logical errors are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate since there's no indication of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.  \n   \n   The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since the code is just a custom exception class with no logic, data, or external interactions, there's no basis for a higher risk score. All reports correctly assign 0.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The code does not perform any malicious actions. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   The scores are consistent and justified based on the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a minimal, standard custom exception class with no malicious or suspicious features. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the code's nature.",
