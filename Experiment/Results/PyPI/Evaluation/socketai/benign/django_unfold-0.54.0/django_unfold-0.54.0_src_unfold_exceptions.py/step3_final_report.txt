  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for use in Python programs.",
  "sources": "Class declaration inheriting from Exception, no input/output or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is a simple class definition with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, clear subclass of Exception, used for custom error handling. No input/output, external data, or malicious patterns are present. The class is empty, serving solely as a named exception. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, with high confidence, consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard custom exception class with no malicious or suspicious elements. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
