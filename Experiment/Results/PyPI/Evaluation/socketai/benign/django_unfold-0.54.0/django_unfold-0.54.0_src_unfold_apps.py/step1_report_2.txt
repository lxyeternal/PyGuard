  "flows": "Import of modules → class instantiation in ready() → assignment to admin.site and sites.site.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code execution, and no data leakage mechanisms. The code modifies Django admin site to use a custom site, which is a common pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Django AppConfig classes for configuration purposes. The 'DefaultAppConfig' class overrides the 'ready()' method to replace the default Django admin site with a custom site instance 'UnfoldAdminSite'. This is done via assignments to 'admin.site' and 'sites.site'. Such modifications are typical in custom Django admin implementations and do not inherently indicate malicious activity. The code does not process user input, execute untrusted data, or perform network operations. The custom site 'UnfoldAdminSite' is imported from a local module, but without its implementation, no malicious behavior can be inferred. Overall, the code is straightforward configuration with no signs of obfuscation or malware. It appears to be a legitimate customization of Django's admin interface.",
  "conclusion": "The code customizes Django's admin site by replacing it with a custom implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code. It functions as a standard configuration pattern in Django projects.",
