  "purpose": "Define a Protocol for action functions with specific attributes and a type for fieldsets used in configurations or UI layout.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data is written or transmitted; no untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only declares types and protocols.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard library modules and defines a Protocol class with attributes for action functions, including optional icon. It also defines a union type for fieldset configurations. The code appears purely declarative, intended for type checking and structural purposes, with no runtime data processing, user input handling, or network communication.",
  "conclusion": "This source code contains no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. It is a straightforward type and interface definition with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
