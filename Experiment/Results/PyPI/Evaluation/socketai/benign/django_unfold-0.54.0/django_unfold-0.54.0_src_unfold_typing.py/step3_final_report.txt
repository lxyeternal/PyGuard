  "purpose": "Type protocol and type alias definitions for action functions and fieldsets.",
  "sources": "No runtime data input/output; static type annotations and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static declarations only.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward type annotations and protocol definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining a Protocol class with specific attributes and a type alias for fieldsets. It involves no data processing, external communication, or dynamic execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code serves as an interface or type contract within a larger system. All reports correctly identify the static, safe nature of this code. The malware score is appropriately zero, obfuscated score zero, and the security risk score should be zero as well, given the absence of any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate; the scores are appropriate. Minor overestimation of risk in some reports (e.g., 0.1) should be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code is safe and poses no security threat.",
