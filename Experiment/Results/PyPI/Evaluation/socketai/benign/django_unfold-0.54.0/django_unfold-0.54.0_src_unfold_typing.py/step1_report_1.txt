  "purpose": "Define a protocol for action functions and a type alias for fieldset data structures.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely type annotations and class protocol definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of importing modules, defining a Protocol class for action functions with specific attributes, and a type alias for complex nested data structures. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic, only static type annotations and protocol definitions. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or security risks are evident. It appears to be a straightforward, well-structured type declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type annotation and protocol definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and intended for type checking and code clarity purposes.",
