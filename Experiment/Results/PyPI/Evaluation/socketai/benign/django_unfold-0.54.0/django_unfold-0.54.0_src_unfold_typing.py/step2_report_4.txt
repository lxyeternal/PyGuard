  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and evaluate the security implications, consistency of scores, and any potential issues.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is purely declarative, involving type annotations, Protocol definitions, and type aliases.\n- No data input/output, external communication, or runtime logic is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The code is standard for defining interfaces and types in Python.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Defines a protocol and a type alias.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious or security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, defining a Protocol and type alias.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No risks detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar interface and type definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same general purpose.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior, but the report assigns a slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk (0.1).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n\n- The code is purely type annotations and interface definitions; there's no evidence of malicious or security-related issues.\n- The slight security risk score (0.1) appears to be an overestimation, as no external data handling, code execution, or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The confidence score (0.9) is high but could be 1.0 given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the nature of the code, the risk score should be 0.0 across the board. The small 0.1 in Report 5 is unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Adjust the risk score in Report 5 to 0.0** to align with the actual security posture.\n- **Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0**.\n- **Confidence scores** are appropriate; full confidence (1.0) is justified for all.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 0       | 0            | 0     |\n\nThis reflects the fact that the code is a straightforward, well-structured type annotation and interface definition with no security concerns.",
