  "purpose": "Define a Protocol for action functions with specific attributes and a type for fieldsets.",
  "sources": "Import statements from collections.abc and typing modules.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines types and a protocol.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard library modules and defines a Protocol class 'ActionFunction' with attributes, including optional 'icon' and a call method. It also defines a type alias 'FieldsetsType' as a union of list/tuple structures. There are no data inputs, external communications, or complex logic. The code appears to serve as a type annotation and interface definition for other components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type annotation and interface setup with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks detected. It is purely structural and intended for type safety.",
