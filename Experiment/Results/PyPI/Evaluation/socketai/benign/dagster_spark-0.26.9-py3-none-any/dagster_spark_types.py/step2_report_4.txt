  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the original code.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose matches the code: defining enums and an exception.\n- Sources and sinks are correctly identified; no untrusted data or output.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- Analysis correctly states the code is straightforward, with no dynamic behavior or malicious intent.\n- Conclusion is appropriate: benign, standard code.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — all consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose matches.\n- Sources and sinks correctly identified; no external data processing.\n- No anomalies.\n- Analysis notes straightforward enum and class definitions, with no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion aligns: benign configuration snippet.\n- Scores: all zero, consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose is accurate.\n- Sources, sinks, and flows correctly described.\n- No anomalies.\n- Analysis emphasizes the standard nature of enum and exception class, with no suspicious activity.\n- Conclusion appropriately states the code is simple and benign.\n- Scores: all zero, consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose matches.\n- Sources, sinks, flows correctly identified.\n- No anomalies.\n- Analysis confirms straightforward enum and class definitions, no malicious activity.\n- Conclusion is appropriate.\n- Scores: all zero.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose is correct.\n- Sources, sinks, flows properly described.\n- No anomalies.\n- Analysis notes the code is standard, with no suspicious patterns.\n- Conclusion aligns with the rest: benign, configuration code.\n- Scores: all zero.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code Content:** The code is purely defining enums and an exception class, with no dynamic code, data processing, external calls, or data leaks.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code.\n- **Security Risk & Risk Scores:** Also correctly assigned as 0; no vulnerabilities or security issues are evident.\n- **Confidence Level:** All reports have high confidence (1), which is justified.\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The code is a straightforward configuration component.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are warranted here.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- Based on the analysis, I agree with the scores assigned in all reports.\n- I would not recommend any changes to the scores.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at **0**.\n- The code poses no security threat.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis is a benign, standard configuration snippet with no security concerns.",
