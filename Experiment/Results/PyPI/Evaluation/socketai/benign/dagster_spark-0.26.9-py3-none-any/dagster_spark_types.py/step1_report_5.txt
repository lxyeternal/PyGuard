  "purpose": "Define enumeration for Spark deployment modes and a custom exception class for Spark operation errors.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing Enum and EnumValue from dagster; enumeration value definitions; class definition for SparkOpError",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; no data sinks or network communications present",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks; code is solely defining types and an exception class",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary enum classes and defines two enumeration values for deployment modes, grouping them into a single Enum object. It also defines a custom exception class. All elements are straightforward, with no external data handling, no code execution, no malicious constructs, and no suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be intended for internal use within a larger application for configuration and error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module defining enums and an exception class for Spark deployment configurations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
