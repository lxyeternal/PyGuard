  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for Spark deployment modes and a custom exception class for Spark operation errors.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'dagster' module, creation of EnumValue objects, Enum class instantiation, class definition for SparkOpError.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code purely defines constants and a class.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'dagster', defines two EnumValue instances representing 'cluster' and 'client' deployment modes, and creates an Enum 'SparkDeployMode' with these values. It also defines a custom exception class 'SparkOpError'. All parts are standard Python constructs for configuration and exception handling. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident; the code serves as a straightforward configuration and exception definition.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard definition of deployment modes and a custom exception. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. No evidence of malware or security issues.",
