  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and verify the claims against the original code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   - The code is straightforward, defining enums and an exception class. No dynamic code, external calls, or data processing is present.  \n   - All reports correctly identify that there are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or suspicious patterns.  \n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or security issues are detected.  \n   **Conclusion**: The reports' assessments are accurate; no issues are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic**:  \n   - The reports consistently state that the code is benign, with correct reasoning.  \n   - The descriptions of the code's purpose and structure are accurate.  \n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.  \n   **Conclusion**: The reports' reasoning appears sound.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - All reports assign `malware` and `securityRisk` scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.  \n   - `obfuscated` scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.  \n   - Confidence is 1 across all reports, justified by the clear, simple code.  \n   **Suggestion**: The scores seem reasonable; no adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   - All reports assign `securityRisk` and `malware` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.  \n   - No justification for higher scores is necessary here.  \n   \n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions, such as executing external code, handling untrusted input, or containing backdoors.  \n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.  \n   \n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly identify the code as configuration or setup code without malicious intent.  \n   - No unwarranted vulnerabilities are claimed.  \n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis; all indicate no malicious or risky behavior.  \n\n**Final Personal Assessment**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score**: 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a simple, standard configuration snippet defining enums and an exception class for Spark deployment modes. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Recommendation**:  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
