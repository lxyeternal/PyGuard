  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is straightforward: it imports `Enum` and `EnumValue` from `dagster`, defines two enum values (`cluster` and `client`), creates an `Enum` named `SparkDeployMode`, and defines a custom exception `SparkOpError`.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, data processing, external calls, or handling of untrusted input.\n   - No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - **Conclusion:** The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and serves configuration purposes.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent, thorough, and do not contain logical errors. They correctly interpret the code's purpose.\n   - They uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n   - No flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The code does not perform any risky operations, external calls, or handle untrusted data.\n   - **Conclusion:** No justification needed for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports assign `malware`: 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not exhibit malicious behavior.\n   - **Conclusion:** Malware score is consistent with the code.\n\n6. **Claims About Potential Vulnerabilities Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid speculative claims; they focus on what the code actually does.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is just defining enums and an exception class, with no vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a simple, standard configuration snippet defining enums and an exception class. It does not process untrusted data, perform external operations, or contain any suspicious patterns. The uniformity of the reports and their assessments is justified.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign and safe.  \n- The reports' evaluations are accurate and reasonable.  \n- No changes to scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores and conclusions. The code poses no security concern.",
