  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `Enum` and `EnumValue` from `dagster`.\n- Defines two EnumValues: `\"cluster\"` and `\"client\"`.\n- Creates an Enum `SparkDeployMode` with these values.\n- Defines a custom exception class `SparkOpError`.\n\n**Assessment of Reports:**\n\n1. **Purpose & Sources:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code defines enums for Spark deployment modes and a custom exception class, with appropriate import statements. No issues here.\n\n2. **Sinks & Flows:**  \n   None of the reports identify any data output, external data handling, or untrusted data flow. This is consistent with the code's straightforward structure.\n\n3. **Anomalies & Analysis:**  \n   All reports note the absence of suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The code is standard, serving configuration or constants.\n\n4. **Conclusions & Confidence:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and serves a configuration purpose, with confidence level 1.\n\n5. **Scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk):**  \n   All reports assign `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, and `securityRisk=0`, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Issues:**\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  Since the code only defines enums and an exception class, there's no indication of malicious intent. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  The code is clear and straightforward; no obfuscation is present. Score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Security Risk Score:**  \n  No security issues are apparent. The code does not process untrusted data, perform external calls, or handle secrets. Score of 0 is correct.\n\n**Final Justification:**\n\n- The code is a standard configuration snippet, with no dynamic code, external interactions, or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are thorough and accurate. The code is benign, with no security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is needed.",
