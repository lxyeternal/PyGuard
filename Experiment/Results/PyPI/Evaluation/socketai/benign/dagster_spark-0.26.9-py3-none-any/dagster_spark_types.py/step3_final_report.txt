  "purpose": "Define deployment modes for Spark as an enumeration and provide a custom exception class for Spark operations.",
  "sources": "Importing Enum and EnumValue from dagster; defining enum values 'cluster' and 'client'; defining SparkOpError exception class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or external calls present.",
  "flows": "Enum values assigned to SparkDeployMode; exception class used for error handling within the module.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration snippet that imports standard enum classes, defines two enum values for deployment modes, creates an enum 'SparkDeployMode', and defines a custom exception class. There are no dynamic behaviors, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. All signals indicate benign, standard code serving as configuration or constants. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration component defining enums and an exception class for Spark deployment modes. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assessments and scores in all reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
