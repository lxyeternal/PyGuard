  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for Spark deployment modes and a custom exception class.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'dagster' library, creation of EnumValues and Enum.",
  "sinks": "None present; code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only defines data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; straightforward use of enum and exception class.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a library, defines two EnumValues for 'cluster' and 'client' modes, and creates an Enum called 'SparkDeployMode'. It also defines a custom exception class. There are no indications of malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be part of a configuration or setup module for Spark deployment, with no external data handling or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet for Spark deployment modes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
