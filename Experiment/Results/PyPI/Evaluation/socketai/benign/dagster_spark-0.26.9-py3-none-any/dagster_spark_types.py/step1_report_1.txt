  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for Spark deployment modes and a custom exception class for Spark operation errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Enum and EnumValue from dagster, definitions of EnumValues, and creation of an Enum object.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or data leak points.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports enumeration classes, defines two enum values for deployment modes, creates an Enum with these values, and defines a custom exception class. No dynamic code execution, data processing, or external calls are present. The code is straightforward, using standard library and third-party constructs, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves a straightforward purpose of defining enums and an exception class without any malicious or security-sensitive behavior. It appears to be a benign part of a larger codebase.",
