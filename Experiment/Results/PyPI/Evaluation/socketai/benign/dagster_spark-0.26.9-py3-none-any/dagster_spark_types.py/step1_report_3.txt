{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for Spark deployment modes and a custom exception class for Spark operations errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'dagster' library; creation of EnumValues and Enum objects; class definition.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no outputs or external data interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; the code only defines constants and a class.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs. The Enum values are straightforward string identifiers.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary classes from 'dagster' to define enumerations, then creates two EnumValue instances representing deployment modes ('cluster' and 'client'). These are grouped into a SparkDeployMode Enum with a specified name. Additionally, a custom exception class SparkOpError is defined. There are no input sources, data flows, or external interactions. The code appears to serve as a configuration or constant definition without any dynamic or potentially malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple and standard definition of enums and an exception class for Spark deployment modes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
