  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code only assigns a version string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or logic beyond this assignment. The code is straightforward and standard for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that this is a benign, minimal snippet with no suspicious activity. No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `obfuscated`: 0  \n   - `malware`: 0  \n   - `securityRisk`: 0  \n   \n   These are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports agree that the code is purely a version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious activity, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious intent or activity.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on observable facts—only a version string assignment.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — No malicious activity or intent detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — No obfuscation present.\n- **Risk score:** **0** — No security risk.\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\nThis code snippet is a standard, benign declaration of a package version. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward version string assignment with no security concerns. The scores reflect this, and no adjustments are needed.",
