  "purpose": "Declare the package version as a string assignment to __version__.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static assignment of a string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external output involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows; simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to __version__, a common practice in Python packages. It involves no input/output, external dependencies, functions, or executable logic. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or unusual patterns are present. The code does not pose any security threat or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no security concerns or malicious activity. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
