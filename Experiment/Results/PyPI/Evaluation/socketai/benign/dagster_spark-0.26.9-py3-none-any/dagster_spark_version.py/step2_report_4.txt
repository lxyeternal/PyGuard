  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code is simply assigning a string to `__version__`. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or executable logic. The code is a standard practice in Python packages for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign:\n   - `obfuscated = 0`  \n   - `malware = 0`  \n   - `securityRisk = 0`  \n   - `confidence = 1` (or 1.0)  \n   \n   These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all assessments indicate no malicious activity or security risk, the risk scores are correctly set to zero. There's no justification for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is zero across all reports, aligning with the fact that the code is just a version string assignment with no malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward, standard version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
