  "purpose": "Registering the 'dagster-spark' library version with the DagsterLibraryRegistry for dependency management.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'dagster_spark' modules and the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "Import statements provide data to the registration call; no dynamic or external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward import and registration with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports from 'dagster_spark' and registers the library version. It contains no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no network activity, and no obfuscated logic. The purpose is standard dependency registration, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard setup snippet for dependency version registration within the Dagster framework.",
