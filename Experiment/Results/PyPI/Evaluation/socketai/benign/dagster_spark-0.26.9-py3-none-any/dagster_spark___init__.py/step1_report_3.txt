{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions, classes, and variables from the dagster_spark library and registers the library version in a registry, likely for configuration or plugin management.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __version__ variable from dagster_spark.version and imports functions and classes from dagster_spark modules.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful actions; no network operations, file writes, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "The version information and imported functions are registered internally; no external data flows or untrusted data handling are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior is observed. The imports are from a well-structured library, and registration is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements and a registration call. It imports functions, classes, and a version string from the dagster_spark package and registers the package version with a registry. No input/output handling, no dynamic code execution, and no side effects are evident. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a straightforward module import and registration setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard library registration without any suspicious actions.",
