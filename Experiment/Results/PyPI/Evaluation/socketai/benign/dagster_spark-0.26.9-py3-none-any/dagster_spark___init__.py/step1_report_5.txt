  "purpose": "This code imports specific modules and functions related to the 'dagster_spark' library and registers the library version with 'DagsterLibraryRegistry'.",
  "sources": "Import statements accessing modules and attributes such as '__version__' from 'dagster_spark.version'.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns imported functions and variables; no data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the only flow is retrieving the library version and registering it.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution observed. The registration of version information is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports functions and attributes from the 'dagster_spark' library and registers the library version with 'DagsterLibraryRegistry'. All imported elements are used in a straightforward manner without any data manipulation or external communication. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic library imports and registration without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard setup code for managing library versions.",
