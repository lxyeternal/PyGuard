  "purpose": "Importing modules and registering a library version for dagster-spark integrations.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load modules and a version string.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no data processing or external output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code only registers a library.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward import statements and a registration call. It imports modules related to dagster-spark components and registers the library version with a registry. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module import and registration routine with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
