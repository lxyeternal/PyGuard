  "purpose": "Factory function to create a Dagster operation for executing Spark jobs with validated parameters and resource dependencies.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'name', 'main_class', 'description', 'required_resource_keys'; configuration via 'context.op_config'; resource method 'context.resources.spark.run_spark_job'.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of 'run_spark_job' with configuration and main class; no untrusted data sinks or external data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Parameters validated and passed to 'run_spark_job' through 'context.op_config' and 'main_class'; no complex data flows or external data manipulation observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; straightforward and standard implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility for creating Spark operations within Dagster pipelines. It performs parameter validation, sets up operation metadata, and calls a resource method to run Spark jobs. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns are present. The logic is clear, and the code aligns with typical pipeline practices. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. External resource trustworthiness is outside the scope but should be considered in deployment contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility for Spark job orchestration with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the code's content.",
