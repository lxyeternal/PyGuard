{
  "purpose": "Defines a function to create a Dagster Spark operation with specified parameters and configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (dagster, dagster_spark) and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The function call 'context.resources.spark.run_spark_job' which executes a Spark job with provided configuration.",
  "flows": "Function parameters flow into 'check' validations, then into the 'spark_op' function which executes 'run_spark_job' using 'context.op_config' and 'main_class'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. Use of 'check' for validation is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward factory for creating Spark job Dagster ops. It validates input parameters, defines a Dagster op with appropriate tags and resources, and calls a Spark run method with configuration. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues are evident. All imported modules and functions are standard for Dagster pipelines, and the logic is clear and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and intended for pipeline configuration. No malicious activity or security risks identified.",
