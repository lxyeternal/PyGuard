  "purpose": "This code constructs and formats a command to submit a Spark job via spark-submit, parsing configurations and handling environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variable 'SPARK_HOME' using os.environ.get('SPARK_HOME')",
  "sinks": "Constructed command list returned by construct_spark_shell_command",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'SPARK_HOME' -> construct_spark_shell_command -> spark-submit command list",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets observed. No dynamic code execution, no data exfiltration, or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard parameter validation using 'dagster._check' functions, constructs a command list for spark-submit, and formats configuration options. It retrieves 'SPARK_HOME' from environment variables as a configuration dependency, which is typical for such scripts. No malicious logic or backdoors are present. The functions are well-structured and focus on command construction. No suspicious behavior such as code injection, data leaks, or malicious network activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for constructing Spark job commands. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior based on its current implementation.",
