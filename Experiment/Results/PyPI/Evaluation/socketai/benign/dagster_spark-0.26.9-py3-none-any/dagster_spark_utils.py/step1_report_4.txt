  "purpose": "This code constructs and formats command-line arguments for submitting a Spark job via spark-submit, including configuration parsing and environment setup.",
  "sources": "User-provided parameters: application_jar, main_class, master_url, spark_conf, deploy_mode, application_arguments, spark_home; Environment variable SPARK_HOME",
  "sinks": "The output command list (spark_shell_cmd) that could be executed in a shell; environment variables accessed for configuration",
  "flows": "Parameters and environment variables flow into command construction; no untrusted data flows into unsafe system commands directly",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no unusual or suspicious code patterns observed. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard parameter validation and environment variable access. It constructs a command list for spark-submit, ensuring required parameters are present and correctly formatted. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected. It relies on external inputs and environment variables but does not misuse them. The environment variable SPARK_HOME is used securely to locate spark binary. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for constructing Spark job commands, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
