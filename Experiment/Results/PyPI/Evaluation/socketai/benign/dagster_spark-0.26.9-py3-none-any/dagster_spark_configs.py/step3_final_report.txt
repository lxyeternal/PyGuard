  "purpose": "Define Spark job submission configuration parameters, including cluster URL, deployment mode, application jar path, arguments, and environment settings.",
  "sources": "User-provided input for master_url, application_jar, application_arguments, spark_home, and deploy_mode.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted values used in configuration parameters, especially application_jar and master_url, which could influence downstream execution if maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user parameters) flow into configuration fields; these fields are used by Spark to launch jobs but are not processed internally for malicious content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. The code relies on external inputs without validation, which could be misused but is typical for configuration scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration setup for Spark jobs, utilizing Dagster's Field and StringSource to define parameters. It imports necessary modules, defines a function returning a dictionary of configuration fields, and does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. The parameters depend on user input, which could be malicious if supplied untrusted, but the code itself remains benign. No signs of obfuscation or malware are present. The security risk stems from external input trustworthiness, not from internal code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard configuration module for Spark job submission. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or active security vulnerabilities. The main concern is the trustworthiness of external inputs like 'application_jar', but this is outside the code's scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to potential external misuse, which is acceptable for such configuration scripts.",
