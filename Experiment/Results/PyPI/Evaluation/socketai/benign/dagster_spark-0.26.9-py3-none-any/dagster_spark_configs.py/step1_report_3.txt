{
  "purpose": "Define and configure Spark job submission parameters within a Python application, including cluster deployment options, application jar path, and arguments.",
  "sources": "User or external input for fields such as 'master_url', 'application_jar', 'application_arguments', and 'spark_home'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the 'application_jar' path and other configuration parameters could be used to specify malicious jars or paths, but the code itself does not perform direct actions with these values.",
  "flows": "External inputs are assigned to configuration fields; these values are returned in a dictionary for use in Spark submission processes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalous or suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, malicious network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The code is mainly configuration setup and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration module, defining parameters for Spark job submission. It imports configuration classes and types, defines a function that sets up a dictionary with Spark settings, and provides descriptive documentation. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or file manipulations occur within this snippet. The only inputs are external configuration values, which are not used maliciously within this code. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The configuration references (such as Spark documentation) are benign and for informational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration setup for Spark jobs, with no malicious intent or security risks evident. It accepts external input parameters but does not process or handle them in a malicious way. Overall, it is safe and free from malware or security vulnerabilities.",
