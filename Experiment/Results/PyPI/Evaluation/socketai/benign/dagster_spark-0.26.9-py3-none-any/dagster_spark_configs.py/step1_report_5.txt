  "purpose": "Define Spark job configuration parameters for submitting Spark applications, including master URL, deployment mode, application jar, and arguments.",
  "sources": "User or external input for 'master_url', 'application_jar', 'application_arguments', and 'spark_home'.",
  "sinks": "Configuration parameters used to launch Spark jobs; no direct data leak points identified.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., 'master_url', 'application_jar') flow into Spark job configuration; no untrusted data directly influences execution beyond configuration setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code strictly sets configuration parameters without executing untrusted commands or data.",
  "analysis": "The code imports configuration handling from 'dagster' and 'dagster_spark' modules to define Spark job settings. It captures user inputs for critical parameters like master URL, deployment mode, and application jar path, with descriptive documentation. The parameters are returned as a dictionary to be used in job submission. There are no signs of malicious logic such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The parameters are standard configuration options for Spark job submission, and no sensitive information is hardcoded. The functions simply define and return configuration data without executing or interpreting untrusted input beyond configuration setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration setup for Spark jobs with no malicious intent, suspicious behaviors, or security risks. It solely manages configuration parameters and does not perform any harmful operations.",
