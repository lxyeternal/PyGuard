  "purpose": "Define Spark job configuration parameters for submission, including master URL, deployment mode, application jar, and arguments.",
  "sources": "Input sources are the configuration fields: master_url, deploy_mode, application_jar, application_arguments, spark_home.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present in the code; it primarily defines configuration parameters.",
  "flows": "User provides configuration inputs via the defined fields; these are used internally for Spark job submission.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. No external network calls or suspicious code flows observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports configuration definitions and creates a configuration dictionary for Spark jobs. It relies on user-provided inputs for critical parameters such as master URL and application jar path. No dynamic execution, no code injection points, and no external data fetching are present. All fields are standard configuration definitions with descriptions. The code does not handle sensitive data or perform any operations that could be malicious. The dependencies used (dagster and dagster_spark) are standard and relevant for deployment, with no signs of malicious behavior. The only potential concern would be if user inputs are maliciously crafted, but that is outside the scope of this code as it is merely defining configuration schemas.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for Spark job submission with no malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks detected. It is safe and typical for such deployment scripts.",
