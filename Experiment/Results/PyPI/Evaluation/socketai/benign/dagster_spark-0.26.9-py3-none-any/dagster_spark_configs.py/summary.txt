  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard configuration module for Spark job submission. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or active security vulnerabilities. The main concern is the trustworthiness of external inputs like 'application_jar', but this is outside the code's scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to potential external misuse, which is acceptable for such configuration scripts."
