      "conclusion": "The code is a standard Spark job launcher with a known security concern related to command injection risk due to the use of subprocess.call with shell=True and unvalidated inputs. There is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.4), primarily due to the command injection potential. To improve security, inputs should be sanitized, or subprocess should be invoked without shell=True."

      "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard configuration module for Spark job submission. It does not contain malicious code, obfuscation, or active security vulnerabilities. The main concern is the trustworthiness of external inputs like 'application_jar', but this is outside the code's scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to potential external misuse, which is acceptable for such configuration scripts."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious utility for building Spark command-line arguments. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or significant security vulnerabilities. The low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified, and all reports' assessments are consistent with this analysis."
