  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a compression algorithm with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only minor issue is the debug print statement, which is harmless but should be cleaned up. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to the debug statement."
