{
  "purpose": "The code provides compression and decompression utilities for strings using a variant of LZ-string algorithm, primarily intended for encoding data into Base64, UTF-16, or URI-safe formats.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'uncompressed' parameter in compression functions, and from encoded compressed strings in decompression functions. Also reads from global variables like 'keyStrBase64' and 'keyStrUriSafe' for encoding/decoding mappings.",
  "sinks": "Outputs encoded or decoded strings. No direct data sinks to network or filesystem are present within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input strings into compression functions, through internal encoding/decoding routines, and out as encoded strings or decompressed results. No external data or untrusted inputs are explicitly sent or received beyond function parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code employs standard encoding/decoding and compression logic. The only potentially suspicious aspect is a print statement ('print(end)') within 'compressToBase64', which might be unintended debug output. There are no malicious network calls, file modifications, or data theft mechanisms present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard LZ-string compression/decompression algorithm with multiple encoding options (Base64, UTF16, URI-safe). It reads input data, processes it with compression routines, and outputs encoded strings. The presence of a print statement appears to be a debug leftover, not malicious. The code does not perform any network activity, file I/O, or access environment variables. No obfuscation techniques or suspicious constructs are found. The functions operate solely on provided data, and no external communication or data exfiltration mechanisms are embedded.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of data compression and encoding functions with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The only minor concern is an extraneous print statement, which could be a debug artifact. Overall, this code is safe and does not pose supply chain security threats.",
