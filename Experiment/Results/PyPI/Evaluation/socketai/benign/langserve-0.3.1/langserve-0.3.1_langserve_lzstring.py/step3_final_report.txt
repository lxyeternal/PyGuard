  "purpose": "Implementation of string compression and decompression using the LZ-string algorithm supporting multiple encoding formats (Base64, UTF-16, URI-safe).",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to compression/decompression functions; internal dictionaries and string characters.",
  "sinks": "Return of compressed or decompressed strings; no external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through internal dictionaries and bitwise operations, resulting in output strings; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a 'print(end)' statement in 'compressToBase64', likely a debugging artifact.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, transparent implementation of the LZ-string compression algorithm. The only unusual element is the 'print(end)' statement, which outputs the residual string length modulo 4, serving no security purpose. No obfuscation, network activity, or malicious code is present. The code's logic is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns. The debug print does not impact security but should be removed in production.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a compression algorithm with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only minor issue is the debug print statement, which is harmless but should be cleaned up. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is approximately 0.1 due to the debug statement.",
