  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security issues, code behavior, and consistency with the provided code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is a route registration system for langchain runnables, with safeguards against route duplication, optional dependencies, and placeholder functions raising AssertionError for unimplemented endpoints. It emphasizes that no malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks are evident.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The use of `raise AssertionError` in placeholder functions is typical for unimplemented or testing endpoints, not malicious.\n  - Optional dependency on `sse_starlette` is handled gracefully.\n  - No hardcoded secrets, external connections, or obfuscated code.\n  - The global state management via weak references appears intended for route conflict prevention.\n  - No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or system manipulation.\n\n- **Security implications:** Very low risk. The code is a legitimate API registration utility with no malicious activity.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to placeholder functions).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on the structured approach for exposing runnables, validation, and dynamic route creation. It notes the placeholder functions with AssertionError and optional dependencies.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No hardcoded secrets or suspicious external calls.\n  - Placeholder functions are standard for unimplemented routes.\n  - No malicious code, backdoors, or network activity.\n  - Use of deprecated warnings is noted but not malicious.\n\n- **Security implications:** Very low risk.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (slightly higher but still negligible).\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the route registration for invoke, batch, streaming, schemas, and feedback, with checks for dependencies and placeholder functions raising AssertionError.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Placeholder functions are for documentation/testing, not malicious.\n  - No secrets, external network activity, or obfuscated code.\n  - Use of warnings for deprecation is standard.\n\n- **Security implications:** Very low risk.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, focusing on the registration of multiple endpoints, handling of optional dependencies, and placeholder functions.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - No malicious behavior or hidden backdoors.\n  - Placeholder functions are for documentation/testing.\n  - No external network connections or code injection.\n  - Use of deprecated warnings is for legacy support.\n\n- **Security implications:** Very low risk.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the route setup, input handling, and placeholder functions raising AssertionError. Notes no malicious activity or secrets.\n\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Placeholder functions are normal for unimplemented endpoints.\n  - No suspicious external activity.\n  - No obfuscated or malicious code.\n  - The code is a standard API layer.\n\n- **Security implications:** Very low risk.\n\n- **Score Justification:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports. The code is clear, well-structured, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Generally low, around 0.1 to 0.2, primarily due to placeholder functions that raise AssertionError and use of deprecated warnings. These are standard for incomplete or test endpoints and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (average, considering placeholder functions and optional dependencies)\n\n**This code appears to be a legitimate, purpose-built API registration module for FastAPI, with no malicious activity detected.**",
