{
  "purpose": "The code implements a client-side parser and connection handler for Server-Sent Events (SSE) over HTTP, allowing asynchronous and synchronous streaming of events from a server.",
  "sources": "Reading response lines from httpx.Response object via iter_lines() and aiter_lines(). Reading headers such as 'content-type' from the response.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code processes incoming data streams and headers but does not write or execute untrusted data beyond normal parsing.",
  "flows": "Response data lines flow from the server to the SSEDecoder via iter_lines()/aiter_lines(), and parsed SSE events flow from the decoder to the caller via iter_sse()/aiter_sse(). Header validation occurs before stream processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or malicious code present. The code adheres to standard SSE handling and connection management practices. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for parsing server-sent events, verifying content type headers, and establishing synchronous and asynchronous connections via context managers. It correctly handles response headers and streaming data without executing or injecting code. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. All data flows are standard for SSE clients, and no unsafe operations or hidden code features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an SSE client with proper validation and stream handling. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies detected.",
