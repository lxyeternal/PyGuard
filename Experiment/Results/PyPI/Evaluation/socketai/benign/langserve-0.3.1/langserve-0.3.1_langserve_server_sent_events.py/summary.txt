  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SSE client with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and justified by the network handling nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is very low (~0.1). No adjustments are necessary."
