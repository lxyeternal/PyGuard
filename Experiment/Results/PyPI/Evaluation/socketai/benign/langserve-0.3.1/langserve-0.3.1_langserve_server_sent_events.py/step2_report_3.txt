  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code against the described issues, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a standard implementation of an SSE client using `httpx`.\n- It includes both sync and async context managers, header validation, and a decoder class.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n- All responses consistently describe the code as safe, standard, and well-structured.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Correctly describes the code as an SSE client.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Accurate; reads from response streams, processes, yields events.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected; aligns with the code.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0 (appropriate)  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0 (appropriate)  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0.1 (low, due to general network handling)\n\n**Verdict:** Fully consistent, no issues.  \n**Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with slight variation in confidence (0.95).  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0 (more confident, minimal risk)\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.  \n**Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- Similar content, slightly lower confidence (0.9).  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- Same as above, with confidence 0.9.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- Confidence is 1.0, but the rest aligns with previous assessments.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.  \n- **Scores:**  \n  - *malware:* 0  \n  - *obfuscated:* 0  \n  - *securityRisk:* 0.1 (consistent with other reports)\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation & Justification**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in all cases, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to network operations, which is reasonable.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, adheres to standard practices, and no suspicious elements are detected.\n- The risk score could be lowered to 0, given the absence of any security concerns, but 0.1 is acceptable as a conservative measure.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports is correct.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 is correct.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's nature, I suggest lowering from 0.1 to 0 for clarity, but leaving it at 0.1 is also acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Security Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0 (or 0.1)  |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0 (or 0.1)  |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0 (or 0.1)  |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0 (or 0.1)  |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0 (or 0.1)  |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe implementation of an SSE client, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The scores are reasonable; minor adjustments could be made to set the risk score to zero for maximum accuracy.",
