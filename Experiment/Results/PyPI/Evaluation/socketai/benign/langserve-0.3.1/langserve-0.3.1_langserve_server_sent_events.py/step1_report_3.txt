{
  "purpose": "The code implements a client for handling Server-Sent Events (SSE) streams over HTTP, allowing both synchronous and asynchronous connections to receive event data.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from HTTP responses via 'response.iter_lines()' and 'response.aiter_lines()' in the 'EventSource' class methods.",
  "sinks": "No data is written to external sinks such as files, databases, or network endpoints within this code.",
  "flows": "Input data from HTTP response streams is processed through the 'decode' method of 'SSEDecoder' and yielded as structured SSE events.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code relies on standard libraries and proper response validation.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly verifies response content type, handles SSE parsing according to the specification, and employs context managers for resource management. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or malicious logic is evident. The only notable activity is reading server-sent event streams, which is standard for SSE clients. No external data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of an SSE client with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. It performs expected functions securely and transparently.",
