  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes a standard SSE client reading from httpx response streams.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correct; processes incoming data, no external writes.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code; standard pattern.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Clear, trustworthy, high confidence (1).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — aligns with no malicious activity.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — very low, justified by the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; standard SSE parsing.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious or suspicious patterns; adheres to typical SSE client design.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Reasonable, high confidence (0.95).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is clear.  \n- Risk: 0 — standard implementation with minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; standard SSE client.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No suspicious activity, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious behavior observed.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- Risk: 0 — no significant security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; standard SSE handling.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malware present.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is transparent.  \n- Risk: 0 — minimal security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; standard SSE client.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Fully aligned, high confidence (1.0).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 — no malicious activity.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — clear code.  \n- Risk: 0.1 — very low, justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is straightforward, readable, and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in all reports, justified by the nature of the code being a streaming client — inherently low risk but still involving network operations that could, in theory, be exploited if misused.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\nBased on the code review and the reports:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-implemented SSE client.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The security risk remains minimal, primarily due to network operations, but no specific vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated:** **0**  \n- **Risk:** **0.1** (consistent with the reports and justified by the nature of network streaming code)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, trustworthy, and aligns with best practices for SSE clients. No adjustments to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that the server endpoints and data sources are trusted, as the client code itself appears secure.",
