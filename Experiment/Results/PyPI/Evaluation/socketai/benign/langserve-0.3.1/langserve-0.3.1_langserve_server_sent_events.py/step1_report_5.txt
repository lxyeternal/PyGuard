{
  "purpose": "This code implements a client for Server-Sent Events (SSE) using the httpx library, providing synchronous and asynchronous connection methods to stream SSE data.",
  "sources": "Reads data from HTTP response streams via response.iter_lines() and response.aiter_lines() in the EventSource class.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or manipulation points are minimal; data is processed internally and returned as structured objects. No direct sinks for untrusted data are evident.",
  "flows": "Response stream -> SSEDecoder.decode() -> yields ServerSentEvent objects",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns. The code cleanly handles SSE parsing and connection management without obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for parsing SSE streams, including decoding lines into structured events. It validates Content-Type headers and manages connection context for both sync and async scenarios. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code operates solely on incoming network data, with standard SSE processing logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of a Server-Sent Events client using httpx. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware are detected. It simply facilitates streaming SSE data with proper validation and decoding.",
