{
  "purpose": "This code implements a client for Server-Sent Events (SSE) using the httpx library, providing synchronous and asynchronous connection management and decoding of SSE streams.",
  "sources": "Reading response headers and lines from httpx.Response objects, especially in iter_sse and aiter_sse methods, as well as in the connect_sse and aconnect_sse context managers.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is directly written to files, network, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Response headers and lines are read to decode SSE events; data flows from response stream to SSE decoder, which yields structured events.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. No external or suspicious data manipulations are present. The code adheres to standard SSE client implementation practices.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard implementation of an SSE client with proper response content-type checks and clean handling of SSE lines via a decoder class. It uses context managers to manage network streams safely and supports both synchronous and asynchronous operation modes. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code only reads and processes server-sent event streams without writing or transmitting data elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an SSE client for Python, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It follows standard patterns and contains no signs of malware or security risks.",
