  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard SSE client implementation reading from httpx responses.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** Processes incoming SSE data, no data written elsewhere.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Follows standard practices.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, trustworthy, no malicious activity detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (very low).  \n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The low security risk score aligns with the absence of suspicious behavior. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, reading response lines, validating headers.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data written; processes data streams.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets or malicious code. Adheres to standard practices.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Validates that code is legitimate SSE client, no malicious activity. Slightly lower confidence (0.95).  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, standard SSE client, proper validation.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external sinks; processes incoming data streams.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate implementation, no malicious signs.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard SSE client, with proper header validation.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data writing; processes streams.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Safe, standard implementation.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n**Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, with emphasis on validation and decoding.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data exfiltration or malicious sinks.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well-structured, safe, no malware detected.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (very low).  \n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0. No malicious activity, payload, or suspicious code structures are present.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports indicate 0, and the code is clear and readable.  \n- **Risk Score:** Very low (0.1 or 0), justified by the absence of vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.05 (very minimal, mainly due to the network interaction aspect, but no issues detected)\n\n### Final notes:\n- The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of an SSE client using `httpx`.  \n- No signs of supply chain or security risks.  \n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe overall assessment aligns with the reports: the code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks.",
