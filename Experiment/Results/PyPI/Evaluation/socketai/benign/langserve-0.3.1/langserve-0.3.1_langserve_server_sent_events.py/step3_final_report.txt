{
  "purpose": "Provides an SSE client implementation using httpx, capable of handling server-sent events both synchronously and asynchronously, with proper header validation and decoding.",
  "sources": "Reads lines from the HTTP response stream via iter_lines() and aiter_lines().",
  "sinks": "Yields decoded SSE events; does not write or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Response stream lines are decoded by SSEDecoder; decoded events are yielded to callers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard SSE client with correct header validation, decoding, and resource management. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behaviors are present. The code reads from response streams, validates content type, and yields events, all following best practices. No external data is written or executed, and no suspicious patterns are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured SSE client with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and justified by the network handling nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is very low (~0.1). No adjustments are necessary.",
