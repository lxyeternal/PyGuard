  "purpose": "Initialize package version information by retrieving metadata from the package distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata using importlib.metadata.version(__package__).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior, no data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "Metadata version retrieval flows from the source (__package__) to the assignment of __version__, with exception handling for missing metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard library functions in a straightforward manner. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to retrieve the package's version using importlib.metadata.version, which is a standard approach for versioning in Python packages. If the package is not found, it gracefully assigns an empty string to __version__. The metadata import is then deleted to clean up the namespace. The code does not include any dynamic execution, network communication, or suspicious logic. It appears to be a conventional initialization script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation for fetching package version information. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
