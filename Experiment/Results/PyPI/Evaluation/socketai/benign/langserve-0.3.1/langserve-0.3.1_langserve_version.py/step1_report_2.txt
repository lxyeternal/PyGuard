{
  "purpose": "Retrieve and assign the package version metadata, serving as the main entry point of the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package metadata using importlib.metadata.version(__package__)",
  "sinks": "No typical data sinks or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "The source (metadata.version call) flows into the assignment of __version__.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a try-except block to handle missing metadata gracefully; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the metadata module from importlib, attempts to retrieve the package version, and assigns it to __version__. If the package metadata isn't found, it assigns an empty string. It then deletes the imported metadata module to prevent namespace pollution. The logic is straightforward, standard, and does not involve any external inputs, network activity, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation for retrieving package version information. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
