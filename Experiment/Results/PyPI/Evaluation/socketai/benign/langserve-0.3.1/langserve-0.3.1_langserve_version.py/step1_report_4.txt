  "purpose": "Initialize package by retrieving version information from package metadata.",
  "sources": "metadata.version(__package__)",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "metadata.version(__package__) -> assigns value to __version__",
  "anomalies": "Use of __package__ with importlib.metadata; no unusual code patterns, but reliance on package metadata can be a minor concern if __package__ is manipulated externally.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to read the package version using importlib.metadata's version() function. It handles the case where the package metadata is missing by assigning an empty string. The code deletes the imported metadata module to avoid namespace pollution. All operations are standard and do not involve untrusted inputs or risky behavior. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical pattern for setting a package's version information, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is straightforward and safe.",
