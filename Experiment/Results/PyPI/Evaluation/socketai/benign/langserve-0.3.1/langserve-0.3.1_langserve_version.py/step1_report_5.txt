  "purpose": "Retrieve and store the package version metadata if available",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata via importlib.metadata.version(__package__)",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or security effects are present",
  "flows": "Code fetches version info from package metadata, assigns it to __version__",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to access package version metadata using importlib.metadata.version with __package__. If the package metadata is not found, it catches the PackageNotFoundError and sets __version__ to an empty string. The code then deletes the imported metadata module to avoid namespace pollution. This is a standard pattern for safely retrieving package version info and does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward, safe operation to retrieve package version information, with appropriate error handling. No malicious intent or security risks are detected.",
