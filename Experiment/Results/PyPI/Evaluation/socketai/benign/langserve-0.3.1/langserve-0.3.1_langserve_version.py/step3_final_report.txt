  "purpose": "Retrieve the package version information using importlib.metadata, handling missing metadata gracefully.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version(__package__)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Source: importlib.metadata.version(__package__) -> Exception handling -> Assigns to __version__",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'del metadata' after import is unusual but not malicious; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard library functions to obtain package version info, with proper exception handling for missing packages. The deletion of the 'metadata' module is unconventional but harmless. No network activity, no untrusted input, and no obfuscated or malicious code are present. The logic is straightforward and aligns with common practices in Python packaging. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard pattern for retrieving package version information. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
