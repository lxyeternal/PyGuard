  "purpose": "To define the main entry point into the package and retrieve its version information.",
  "sources": "Importing 'metadata' from 'importlib'; accessing 'metadata.version' with '__package__'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Import 'metadata' -> attempt to get version -> fallback to empty string if not found -> delete 'metadata'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'del metadata' to remove the imported module, which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to retrieve the package version using importlib.metadata, which is a standard way to access package metadata. It handles the exception where package metadata is missing, setting version to an empty string. The deletion of 'metadata' after use is somewhat atypical but not malicious. There are no sources of untrusted input, no suspicious data flows, and no malicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and does not contain any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe approach to obtaining package version information at runtime. No malicious or security risks are present.",
