  "purpose": "To serve as the main entry point and public interface for the package, exposing core components and version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'langserve' module, providing access to various classes and functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or data; this file primarily exports symbols.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this script does not process data but only imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. No obfuscated or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from internal modules and defines a public API via __all__. It acts solely as a public interface without executing any logic or handling data. The import statements and list of exported symbols appear standard. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities are present. The code is straightforward and serves as an entry point with no external data processing or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple public interface file for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It only exposes select components for external use and does not contain any suspicious or malicious code.",
