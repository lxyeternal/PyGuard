  "purpose": "This script serves as the main entry point and public interface for a Python package, exposing core components for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'langserve' modules and the __version__ attribute",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow or processing logic present",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports selected classes and functions from the 'langserve' package modules and exposes them via the __all__ list. There are no data inputs, processing, or output operations, and no indicators of malicious intent. The structure is straightforward and typical for a package's main entry point, focusing on interface exposure. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package entry script that publicly exposes specific components. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and appears safe. No security risks or malware signals are detected.",
