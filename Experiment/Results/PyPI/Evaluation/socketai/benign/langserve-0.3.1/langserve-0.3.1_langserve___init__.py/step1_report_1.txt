  "purpose": "This script serves as the main entry point and public interface for the package, defining what modules and functions are accessible externally.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and attributes from the 'langserve' package: api_handler, client, schema, server, version.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling in this code snippet; it primarily exports symbols.",
  "flows": "The code imports specific components and re-exports them, establishing a controlled public API without processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present. The code strictly defines exports with no dynamic execution or secret handling.",
  "analysis": "The script acts as an entry point, importing specific classes and functions from internal modules and explicitly defining the public API with '__all__'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a straightforward module for organizing the package's public interface.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package entry point with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks detected. It simply re-exports selected components for external use.",
