  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward package entry point.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious activity are identified.\n- The code only imports modules and re-exports symbols via `__all__`.\n- No untrusted data handling, external communication, or secret management is present.\n- The malware score in all reports is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Code presence and correctness:**\n   - The code snippet matches the description in all reports. It acts as a module that re-exports selected components.\n   - No dynamic code, secret handling, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The code is standard for a Python package main entry point.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; no logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to issues:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**\n   - Since the code is benign, no higher risk scores are justified.\n   - The reports correctly assign zero to malware and security risk.\n\n5. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's function.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the detailed analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard, safe package entry point with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Score |\n|-----------------|--------------|\n| Malware         | 0            |\n| Obfuscated      | 0            |\n| Security Risk   | 0            |\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis code is benign, with no security concerns or malware signals. The reports are accurate and consistent.",
