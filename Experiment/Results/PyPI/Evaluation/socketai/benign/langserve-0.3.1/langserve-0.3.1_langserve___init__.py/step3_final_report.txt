{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the main entry point for a Python package, exposing selected internal modules and functions via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules within the package ('langserve.api_handler', 'langserve.client', 'langserve.schema', 'langserve.server', 'langserve.version') to import classes and variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code only imports and re-exports symbols.",
  "flows": "The flow is from internal module imports to the module namespace, with no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, with static import statements and a defined __all__ list.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package main module that imports specific components and exposes them via __all__. It contains no dynamic code, external communication, secrets, or obfuscation. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The structure and purpose are typical for a package's __init__.py or main interface module, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package entry point with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent. No adjustments to scores are necessary.",
