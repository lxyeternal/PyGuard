  "purpose": "This module serves as the main entry point and public interface for the package, exposing selected classes and functions for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the 'langserve' package modules",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external communication in this code snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only sets up imports and exports without data processing",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a clear public API by importing key classes and functions from internal modules and exposing them via the '__all__' list. It acts as an interface aggregator. There are no input sources, no sinks for data, nor complex flows. The code is straightforward and conventional for a package entry point, with no signs of malicious behavior or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard entry point module exposing public interfaces without any malicious or suspicious activity. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or contain any anomalies that indicate malicious intent.",
