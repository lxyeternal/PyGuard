{
  "purpose": "The code defines a utility function to create custom root models for Pydantic validation schemas with customized schema and JSON schema generation methods.",
  "sources": "The code reads constant values from imported modules (`DEFAULT_REF_TEMPLATE`, `GenerateJsonSchema`, `JsonSchemaMode`), function parameters (`name`, `type_`, `by_alias`, `ref_template`, `schema_generator`, `mode`), and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present. The code primarily constructs classes and schema dictionaries internally.",
  "flows": "The flow involves creating a new class that extends `RootModel`, with schema methods calling superclass methods and modifying returned schema dicts; no data flows from external untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious string manipulations, or unusual code constructs. The code uses standard Python and Pydantic features for class creation and schema manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an inner `schema` function that customizes the schema dictionary, and a `model_json_schema` function that customizes the JSON schema. Both functions call superclass methods via `super()` and modify the returned schemas by adding a 'title'. It creates a new class dynamically with specified attributes, including classmethods for schema generation. No external input is processed or written to external systems. The constants used are from Pydantic, and no suspicious data handling or code execution occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for creating customized Pydantic root models with no malicious intent. It leverages existing library features without suspicious modifications or external data handling. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
