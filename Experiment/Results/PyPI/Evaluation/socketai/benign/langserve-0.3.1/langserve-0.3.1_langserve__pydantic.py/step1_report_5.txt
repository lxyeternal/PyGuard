{
  "purpose": "Define a function to dynamically create a custom RootModel subclass with overridden schema methods for JSON schema generation.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, pydantic, and pydantic.json_schema; function parameters and local variables within _create_root_model.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or output. No network, file, or system calls present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (name, type_) influence the creation of the class; class methods modify schema dictionaries during class creation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of super(cls, cls).schema() and super(cls, cls).model_json_schema() with type: ignore, which may indicate unconventional or potentially risky dynamic method overriding. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically creates a subclass of pydantic's RootModel with custom schema methods. It overrides schema and model_json_schema to add a 'title' field. The use of super with dynamic class types and type: ignore hints are notable but are standard in advanced metaclass manipulations. No input/output sources, no network or file operations, and no suspicious data handling are present. Overall, the code is a complex class factory for pydantic models, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated utility for creating custom pydantic RootModel subclasses with schema modifications. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks. No malware or obfuscation detected. The code appears safe and purposeful for schema customization.",
