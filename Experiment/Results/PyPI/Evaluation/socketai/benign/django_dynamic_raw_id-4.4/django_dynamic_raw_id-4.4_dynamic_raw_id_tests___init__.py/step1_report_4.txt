  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided in the snippet; it appears to be a blank or minimal script with no apparent functionality.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data reads, or user inputs are evident in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No outputs, network calls, file writes, or other sink functions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows within the code, as it does not process any data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is empty or minimal, offering no functional or structural anomalies; lack of content may be suspicious if the context expects more substantial code.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is essentially empty or contains no executable statements, making it impossible to identify typical security issues such as malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious patterns. The absence of code could be benign or indicative of an incomplete or placeholder script. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual patterns are present. Due to lack of content, no obfuscation or malware can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the minimal or empty code, there are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears benign but provides no functional value or behavior to assess further.",
