  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, obfuscation, and anomalies based on provided code snippets and descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external files, network connections, data processing routines.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, environment variable access, data transmission points, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into data processing or network transmission functions, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, minimal or empty scripts, lack of suspicious network activity, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly interpret the lack of concrete code as limiting their ability to identify malicious activity. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the absence of suspicious indicators. Confidence levels are appropriate, reflecting uncertainty due to missing or minimal code. The security risk scores are low (around 0.2), which aligns with minimal threat assessment. The only adjustment recommended is to set the security risk score in Report 5 to 0, given the absence of code or behavior to evaluate, making the overall assessment more conservative. The reasoning across all reports is sound, and the scores are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are consistent and reasonable, accurately reflecting the lack of malicious indicators. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks is present. Minor adjustments to risk scores for reports with no code would improve accuracy. Overall, the dependency appears benign based on available information.",
