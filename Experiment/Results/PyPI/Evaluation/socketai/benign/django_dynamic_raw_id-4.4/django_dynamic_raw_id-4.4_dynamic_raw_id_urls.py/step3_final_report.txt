  "purpose": "Define URL patterns with dynamic segments for label_view in a Django application.",
  "sources": "URL segments <slug:app_name> and <slug:model_name> extracted from incoming requests.",
  "sinks": "The label_view function receives these URL parameters; potential vulnerabilities depend on its implementation.",
  "flows": "URL parameters flow from the request URL into the view via the URL dispatcher, then into label_view.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; URL patterns are standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django URL configuration with dynamic URL segments. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The URL parameters are user-controlled but are passed into the view without modification. The security implications depend on label_view's handling of these parameters, which is not shown. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators. The confidence is high due to the straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The URL configuration is standard and appears safe. There are no signs of malicious activity or security flaws in this snippet. The main security concern hinges on label_view's internal handling of URL parameters, which cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code is benign, with minimal risk, and scores are appropriate.",
