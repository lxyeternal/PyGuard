  "purpose": "Define URL patterns for a Django application related to dynamic raw ID labeling views.",
  "sources": "URL patterns with dynamic segments: '<slug:app_name>/<slug:model_name>/' and '<slug:app_name>/<slug:model_name>/multiple/'. These segments are user-controlled input.",
  "sinks": "The URL pattern parameters 'app_name' and 'model_name' are used in URL resolution and passed to the 'label_view' function, which may process these inputs.",
  "flows": "User-controlled URL segments (sources) flow into the URL resolver, which calls 'label_view' with these parameters; potential risks depend on 'label_view' implementation, not shown here.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. Usage of standard Django URL patterns and views.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes URL routes with dynamic path segments for 'app_name' and 'model_name'. These are typical in Django to route requests to views based on URL parameters. There are no evident malicious behaviors, such as code injection, hardcoded credentials, or network activity. The inputs are URL segments, which are commonly used for dynamic content rendering. Without the implementation details of 'label_view', no malicious activity can be inferred solely from URL configuration. The code is straightforward and adheres to Django standards.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard URL pattern configuration for a Django project, with dynamic URL segments passed to a view. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears safe based on the provided snippet.",
