  "purpose": "Define URL patterns for a Django app related to labeling models with support for multiple objects.",
  "sources": "Input URLs captured from user requests through Django's URL dispatcher.",
  "sinks": "The label_view function that processes URL parameters and renders templates.",
  "flows": "User requests matching URL patterns are routed to label_view with URL parameters; these parameters influence the behavior of the view and the templates used.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports. Use of URL parameters is standard in Django, and no unsafe data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules from Django and registers URL patterns for a labeling feature. It employs dynamic URL segments (<slug:app_name> and <slug:model_name>), which are standard for Django URL routing. The URL patterns pass fixed parameters (like multi=True) and templates to the label_view, which is a typical pattern. No external data sources, environment variables, or sensitive data are handled in this snippet. The structure appears conventional, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward URL configuration for a Django app's labeling feature. There are no signs of malicious intent, suspicious data handling, or security vulnerabilities in this fragment. It is a benign, standard URL routing setup.",
