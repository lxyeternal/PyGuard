{
  "purpose": "This code provides a custom Django filter component for admin interfaces, enabling filtering based on related object primary keys via a dynamic widget.",
  "sources": "Request GET parameters for filtering; form data from DynamicRawIDFilterForm; user input via the widget in the form.",
  "targets": "Queryset filtering based on form validation results; potential injection via form data used in filter(**filter_params).",
  "flows": "User submits GET request -> get_form retrieves data from request.GET -> form validation -> filtered data used in queryset.filter(**filter_params).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. Usage of dynamic widgets and form initialization appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors found. The code safely uses form.cleaned_data to filter queries, with validation checks.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom Django admin filter leveraging a dynamic widget for filtering by related object IDs. It uses form validation before applying filters, reducing injection risk. No untrusted code execution or data leaks are evident. The filtering relies on Django ORM's parameterization, mitigating SQL injection. No suspicious behaviors like network connections or file modifications are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears secure and does not contain malicious behavior. It implements standard filtering logic with appropriate validation. No signs of malware, hardcoded secrets, or malicious data handling are present.",
