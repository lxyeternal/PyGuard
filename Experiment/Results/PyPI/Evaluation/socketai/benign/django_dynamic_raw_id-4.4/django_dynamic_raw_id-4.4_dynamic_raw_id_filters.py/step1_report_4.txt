{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Django admin filter for dynamically filtering querysets based on related object IDs, providing a form widget and filtering logic.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from request.GET parameters via the get_form method; form data is processed in the queryset method.",
  "sinks": "The queryset method directly uses form.cleaned_data to filter querysets with **kwargs, which could potentially lead to injection if input isn't properly validated.",
  "flows": "GET parameters from request → get_form method populates form data → form validation → cleaned_data used to filter queryset.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual or obfuscated code. Use of form data directly in filter is standard, but reliance on form validation is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a form with a custom widget and uses request GET parameters to initialize form data. During filtering, it validates the form and applies filters using cleaned_data. The filtering uses **kwargs, which is safe given proper form validation. No suspicious external network calls, backdoors, or malicious code behavior are present. The code is standard for Django filter implementations, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django admin filter implementation with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It safely handles user input through form validation and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code.",
