  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code to identify any discrepancies, potential issues, or inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code implements a Django admin filter that uses GET parameters, a custom widget, and form validation to filter querysets based on related object IDs.\n- The logic flow involves extracting GET data, initializing a form, validating it, and applying filters with `filter(**filter_params)`.\n- No reports mention obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors.\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, safe, and does not contain malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's security and logic:\n\n- **Presence of malicious activity:** No signs of malware, network activity, or obfuscation are evident.\n- **Potential injection risks:** The use of form validation and `cleaned_data` mitigates injection risks. The filter uses Django ORM parameterization.\n- **Use of `filter(**filter_params)`:** As long as `filter_params` is derived from validated form data, this is safe.\n- **Widget implementation:** Not provided, but assumed to be standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n### Issue-specific review:\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0.2 or 0, reflecting minimal concern. Given the code's validation and filtering approach, a low score is justified.\n\n**Any adjustments?**  \nThe scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points and potential concerns:\n\n- **Direct use of form.cleaned_data in filter:** Since the data is validated, this is acceptable.\n- **Potential for injection if validation is weak:** Not observed; form validation appears to be correctly used.\n- **Widget safety:** Not detailed, but assumed standard.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 is reasonable given the filtering logic, but could be lowered to 0 if we consider the code very safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, safe implementation of a Django admin filter that filters based on related object IDs via a custom widget. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0 (very low, as the code is straightforward and uses standard practices)\n\n**Final note:** The overall security posture of this code is very strong. No adjustments needed based on the reports and code review.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
