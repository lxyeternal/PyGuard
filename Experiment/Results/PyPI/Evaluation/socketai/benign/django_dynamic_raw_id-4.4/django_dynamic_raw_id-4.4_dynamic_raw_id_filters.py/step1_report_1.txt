  "purpose": "The code defines a custom Django admin filter for filtering querysets based on a related object's primary key via a dynamic raw ID input widget.",
  "sources": "Request GET parameters, form data, and model field definitions.",
  "sinks": "Filtering of querysets using validated form data, rendering of custom filter form widget.",
  "flows": "Request GET parameter (via self.lookup_kwarg) → form data in get_form() → form validation in queryset() → filtered queryset.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code uses standard Django form and filter patterns with no obfuscation or unusual constructs. The form data is filtered safely before being used in queryset filtering.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard Django practices to create a filter form and filter querysets based on user input. The input is taken from GET parameters and validated via a Django form, which helps prevent injection. The form widget is custom but its implementation is not provided, so assumed to be a standard widget that safely renders the input field. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network connections. No hardcoded secrets or unsafe operations are present. The code appears to be a well-structured implementation of a custom filter without suspicious or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of a custom Django admin filter, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It safely processes input data for filtering purposes without exposing vulnerabilities.",
