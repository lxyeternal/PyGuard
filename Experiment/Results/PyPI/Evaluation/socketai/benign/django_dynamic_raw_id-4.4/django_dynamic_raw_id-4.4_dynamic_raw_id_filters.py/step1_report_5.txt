  "purpose": "The code implements a custom Django admin filter for filtering querysets based on related object primary keys using a dynamic raw ID widget.",
  "sources": "GET parameters from HttpRequest (request.GET.get), form data from DynamicRawIDFilterForm",
  "sinks": "queryset.filter(**filter_params) which constructs filter queries based on form input",
  "flows": "request.GET data flows into form initialization, then validated and used to filter queryset",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines form and filter classes for Django admin, utilizing a widget for dynamic raw ID input. Data flow involves GET parameters feeding into form data, which upon validation, is used to filter a queryset. The form sanitizes input before applying it to the query, reducing injection risk. No insecure SQL practices or suspicious data handling are present. The code is standard for Django admin custom filters and does not contain malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, secure implementation of a Django admin filter with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It safely filters querysets based on user input via a custom widget.",
