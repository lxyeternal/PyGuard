  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports identify that the code is a set of Django unit tests focused on views, permissions, and data validation.\n- The sources, sinks, and flows are typical for web application tests.\n- The reports consistently mention hardcoded credentials ('staff'/'staff') in fixtures, which is standard in testing but a minor security concern outside testing contexts.\n- No report detects obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors.\n- Malware scores are all 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.1-0.2), which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- The hardcoded credentials are a concern in production but are acceptable for test code.\n- No evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or unsafe code execution.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1-0.2) are reasonable given the context.\n- The only point of critique is the consistent mention of hardcoded passwords, which is standard in tests but should be handled carefully outside testing environments.\n\n### Score justifications:\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious code or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** Code is straightforward, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score (~0.1-0.2):** Minor risk due to hardcoded credentials, acceptable in testing but should be avoided in production.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign and standard for testing.\n- The minor security concern (hardcoded credentials) is appropriately acknowledged but does not elevate the risk score significantly.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk score:** 0.1-0.2 (due to test credentials, acceptable in testing context)  \n\nThe code is a typical Django test suite with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, with no malware.\n- No obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n- The low security risk is justified by the test environment context.\n- No changes needed to the scoring.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1-0.2. The code is benign and suitable for testing purposes.",
