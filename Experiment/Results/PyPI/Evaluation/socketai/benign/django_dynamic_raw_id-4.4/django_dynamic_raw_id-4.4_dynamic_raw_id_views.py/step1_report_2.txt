{
  "purpose": "Render a Django admin view for selecting and displaying model instances based on provided IDs, with permission checks.",
  "sources": "request.GET['id'] for object IDs, request.user for permission verification",
  "sinks": "render() function for HTML output, reverse() for URL generation",
  "flows": "request.GET['id'] -> object_list parsing -> model.objects filtering or getting -> render with context",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external calls, no obfuscated code or unusual language features. Use of reverse() and get_model() are standard Django features. No data leaks or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code securely handles input validation by sanitizing the 'id' parameter and verifying model existence. Permission checks prevent unauthorized access. URL generation via reverse() is standard, with no evident injection vulnerabilities. The code does not execute untrusted data in unsafe ways or perform any malicious system operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django view with proper permission checks and input validation. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. It appears safe and consistent with typical Django practices.",
