The primary concern is the improper usage of the 'render' function: it passes a tuple of templates instead of a single template string, which could cause server errors but not malicious activity. The use of 'request.GET[\"id\"]' for object IDs and subsequent filtering is straightforward, with validation for integer conversion. Permission checks rely on user permissions, not on untrusted data. No code appears obfuscated or malicious. The overall logic is standard for a Django admin view, with no signs of malware or malicious data flow.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a typical Django view with a bug in the 'render' call (passing a tuple instead of a string for template name). There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The security risk is low, primarily limited to a potential server error due to incorrect render usage, not malicious activity.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
