  "purpose": "Test setup for Selenium-based UI testing of Django admin pages, including login, navigation, and sample data creation.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded credentials ('admin'/'admin'), static URLs, model instance creation.",
  "sinks": "Selenium actions for login and page navigation, database writes.",
  "flows": "Hardcoded credentials used in login form; static URLs used for navigation; data created directly in database.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded password ('admin') in test fixtures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test setup for Selenium testing in Django. It creates a superuser with a hardcoded password, logs in via Selenium, navigates pages, and creates sample data. No untrusted input, external data, or malicious code is present. The main security concern is the hardcoded password, which is common in test environments but should be avoided outside of them. The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's nature and context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard testing code with no malicious intent. The only security issue is the use of a hardcoded password, which is acceptable in testing but should be managed carefully. The scores reflect this appropriately. No modifications are necessary.",
