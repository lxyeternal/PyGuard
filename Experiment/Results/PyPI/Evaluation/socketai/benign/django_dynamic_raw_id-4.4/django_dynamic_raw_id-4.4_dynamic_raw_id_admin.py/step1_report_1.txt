{
  "purpose": "This code provides a Django admin mixin to customize form fields for foreign key and many-to-many relationships using specific widgets.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'db_field' attributes, including 'name' and 'remote_field'; accessing request parameters; importing widgets from local modules.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'db_field.formfield(**kwargs)' which creates form fields possibly with custom widgets; potential exposure if widgets are malicious or misused.",
  "flows": "Code reads 'db_field.name' to determine widget assignment → Assigns widget if condition matches → Calls 'db_field.formfield' with custom kwargs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The widgets are imported from local modules; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. The code is standard Django form customization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django admin mixin that overrides methods to assign custom widgets to specific foreign key and many-to-many fields based on configuration. It utilizes standard Django practices and imports local widget classes. No external data sources, environment variables, or unsafe operations are present. The widget assignments depend on safe attribute checks and are not dynamically executing code from untrusted sources.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate customization of Django admin forms with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It is implementing standard patterns for widget customization, with no malicious payloads detected.",
