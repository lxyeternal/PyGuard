{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Django admin mixin to customize form fields for foreign key and many-to-many relationships with specific widgets.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes, method parameters (db_field, request), and imports from other modules.",
  "sinks": "The code sets widget attributes for form fields, which could potentially influence form rendering and behavior.",
  "flows": "Input data from model fields (db_field) and request object flow into widget assignment and form field creation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or obfuscated code. Usage of dynamic widgets is standard for customization; no evident malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django admin mixin that customizes form fields for specific foreign key and many-to-many fields using custom widgets. It conditionally replaces the default widget with custom widget classes, which are imported from local modules. The flow involves reading model field attributes and assigning widgets accordingly, then calling the superclass method for default behavior. There are no signs of malicious logic such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The use of type annotations and import structure suggests a well-structured and standard implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django admin customization without malicious intent or security risks. It correctly uses safe practices for widget customization and does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
