  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is a Django admin mixin that overrides formfield methods to assign custom widgets based on field names.\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, with no obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns.\n- The widgets are imported from local modules; their internal implementations are unknown, which is a potential concern but not evidenced here.\n- No external data sources, environment variables, or code execution points are present.\n- The logic is straightforward and aligns with common Django practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct, with no apparent bugs or vulnerabilities.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None identified; the pattern is standard.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The only potential concern is reliance on external widget classes (`DynamicRawIDWidget`, `DynamicRawIDMultiIdWidget`) whose implementation is unknown. If these widgets are malicious, that could be problematic, but based on this code alone, no such issue is present.\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0 or near 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0 or very low (~0.1-0.2). Given the code's nature, this seems reasonable.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- Since no malicious code or vulnerabilities are detected, scores should remain low.\n- The only caveat is the imported widgets; if they are malicious, that could elevate risk, but there's no evidence here.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Adjust scores if necessary:** The current scores seem appropriate.\n- **Potential risk:** The only minor concern is the imported widget classes, but without their implementation, this cannot be assessed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (to reflect minimal potential concern about external widget code, but overall very low)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a standard Django admin mixin for customizing form widgets with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** If in the future, the imported widget classes are found to contain malicious code, then the malware score should be increased accordingly. For now, based on this static analysis, all scores are appropriate.",
