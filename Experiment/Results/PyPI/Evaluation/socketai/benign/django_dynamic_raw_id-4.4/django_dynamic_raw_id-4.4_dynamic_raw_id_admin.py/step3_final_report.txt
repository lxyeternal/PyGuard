{
  "purpose": "A Django admin mixin that customizes form fields for foreign key and many-to-many relationships by assigning custom widgets based on a configurable list.",
  "sources": "The code reads the field name from the database model to determine if a custom widget should be assigned.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns widgets to form fields; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Field name check -> widget assignment in formfield_for_foreignkey/formfield_for_manytomany -> widget used in form rendering.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward. The imported widgets are from local modules, but their internal implementation is unknown, which could be a concern if malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django admin mixin that overrides formfield methods to assign custom widgets based on field names. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or handle untrusted input. The imported widgets are external modules, but their content is unknown; however, their mere import does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The logic is clear and aligns with common Django practices. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code but acknowledge the unknowns of imported modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django admin customization pattern with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The potential concern lies in the imported widget classes, but without their implementation, no malicious behavior can be confirmed. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
