  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and applying security expertise.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary**: The code is a Django admin mixin that assigns custom widgets to foreign key and many-to-many fields based on a configuration list. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external data sources are involved.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The code is straightforward, following standard Django practices.\n  - Widgets are imported from local modules; no external or dynamic code execution is evident.\n  - No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors.\n  - The report's confidence (0.9) aligns with the analysis.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n  - Security Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a benign Django admin customization with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The code is standard, with no suspicious patterns.\n  - Widget classes are local imports, no external code execution.\n  - The confidence (1.0) is justified.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary**: The code customizes form fields with specific widgets, with potential concern about the widget classes if they are malicious.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The only potential concern is the imported widget classes (`DynamicRawIDWidget`, `DynamicRawIDMultiIdWidget`).\n  - Their content is unknown; if malicious, they could perform unsafe operations.\n  - However, the code itself is a standard pattern, and no malicious behavior is directly evident.\n  - The report assigns a small security risk (0.1), which seems reasonable given the unknown widget content.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0 (no evidence of malicious code in this snippet)\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.1 (due to unknown widget implementation)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary**: Similar to previous reports, with focus on the potential influence of imported widgets.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The main concern is whether the imported widget classes are malicious.\n  - The code flow itself is safe; no untrusted data is directly executed.\n  - The report assigns a security risk of 0.2, which is cautious but reasonable given the unknowns.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary**: The code replaces form widgets with dynamic widgets, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Assessment**:\n  - The flow is safe; no untrusted data reaches external code.\n  - The imported widget classes are external but their content is unknown.\n  - The report assigns a low security risk (0.1), which seems appropriate.\n\n- **Scores**:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.1\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: All reports correctly identify no evidence of malicious code within this snippet. The widget classes' content is unknown, but the code pattern itself does not suggest malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: None of the reports find obfuscation; the code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Risk Score**:\n  - The main concern is the imported widget classes. If these are malicious, they could introduce security issues.\n  - However, the code snippet itself is safe; the risk is tied to external modules.\n  - The scores assigned (0.1–0.2) are reasonable, reflecting cautious acknowledgment of unknown external code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjustments**:\n  - No changes needed to malware or obfuscated scores.\n  - The security risk scores could be slightly increased to 0.2–0.3 if you want to reflect the uncertainty about the widget implementations, but given the conservative nature, current scores are acceptable.\n\n- **Final Estimated Scores**:\n  - **Malware**: 0\n  - **Obfuscated**: 0\n  - **Risk**: 0.2 (average of the reports' assessments, reflecting the unknown nature of imported widgets)\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The code is a standard Django admin mixin with no evident malicious or obfuscated code. The primary concern is the external widget classes, which are imported but not analyzed here. The current scores are reasonable, and I concur with the cautious risk score of around 0.2.\n\n**Final recommendation**: No immediate security threat detected. Verify the widget classes' implementation to ensure they are safe.",
