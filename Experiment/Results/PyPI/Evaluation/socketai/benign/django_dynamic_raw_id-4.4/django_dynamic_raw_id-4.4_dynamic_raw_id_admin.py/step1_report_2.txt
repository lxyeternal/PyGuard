{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Django admin mixin class to customize form fields for foreign key and many-to-many relationships using specific widgets.",
  "sources": "The class reads the 'dynamic_raw_id_fields' attribute and the 'db_field' parameters to determine when to modify widget behavior.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the widget assignments ('DynamicRawIDWidget', 'DynamicRawIDMultiIdWidget') which could execute arbitrary code if malicious widgets are used, but these are imported modules, not code execution points.",
  "flows": "The code flow checks if a field is in 'dynamic_raw_id_fields', then assigns custom widgets, otherwise proceeds with default behavior. No untrusted data flows into dangerous functions or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are present. The widget classes are imported from local modules, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides a customizable admin interface component, relying on imported widgets. There is no user input parsing or execution of untrusted data within this snippet. It uses standard Django patterns. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign Django admin mixin designed for UI customization. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities within this fragment.",
