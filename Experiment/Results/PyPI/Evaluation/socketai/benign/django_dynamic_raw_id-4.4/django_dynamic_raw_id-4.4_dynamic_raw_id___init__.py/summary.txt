  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly assign low or zero scores due to lack of code or benign descriptions. Report 2's suspicion warrants a moderate malware and risk score, but without concrete evidence, slightly conservative adjustments improve accuracy. Overall, the scoring aligns well with the provided content, with minor adjustments recommended for Report 2."
