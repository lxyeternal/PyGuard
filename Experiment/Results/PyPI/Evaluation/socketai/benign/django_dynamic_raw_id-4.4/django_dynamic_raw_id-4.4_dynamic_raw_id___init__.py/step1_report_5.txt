  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context or documentation, the precise purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Potential data input sources include environment variables, file reads, or network calls, but no explicit source code for such is visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Possible sinks involve system commands, network communications, or data storage, yet no explicit sink functions or actions are demonstrated.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows observable in the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are detected. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or incomplete, lacking obvious input or output points. It does not utilize external libraries in suspicious ways. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors are present. Without additional context or more code, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems standard, with no anomalies or malicious patterns observed.",
