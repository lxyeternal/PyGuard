Overall, the scoring aligns well with the provided content, with minor adjustments recommended for Report 2."

The overall security risk is very low, primarily due to the bug rather than security flaws. No malware or obfuscation detected."

The potential concern lies in the imported widget classes, but without their implementation, no malicious behavior can be confirmed. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content."
