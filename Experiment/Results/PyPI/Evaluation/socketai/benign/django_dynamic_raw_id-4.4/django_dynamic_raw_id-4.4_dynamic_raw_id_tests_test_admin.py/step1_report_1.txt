  "purpose": "Automated test script for dynamic raw ID widget functionality using Selenium in a Django admin context.",
  "sources": "Input data includes element IDs and link texts, primarily from the DOM and test data models.",
  "sinks": "Interactions with web elements (clicks, switch windows), assertions on element text and attribute values.",
  "flows": "Trigger lookup popups, select items, switch windows, verify labels, and save forms; then verify persisted values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious hardcoded URLs. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script interacts with a web application through Selenium to test widget behavior. It clicks on lookup icons, switches browser windows, selects items by link text, and verifies that labels and form values are correctly updated. The code uses standard testing practices, proper model queries, and assertions. No suspicious or malicious code is evident. The code does not contain obfuscated elements, backdoors, or hidden data exfiltration mechanisms. It appears solely to test UI functionality without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test script for UI components with no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. It functions as intended for testing purposes without any suspicious or harmful elements.",
