  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, compare their assessments with the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Code Summary:**\n- The code is a Selenium-based test script for Django admin's dynamic raw ID widgets.\n- It interacts with UI elements, opens popups, selects items, switches windows, and verifies displayed labels and values.\n- It also queries the database via Django ORM to verify persistence.\n- The code uses standard testing practices, with no obfuscated code, no external network activity beyond browser interactions, and no sensitive data handling.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Automated UI test for dynamic raw ID widgets.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, no secrets, no obfuscation, no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The code is straightforward testing code, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** **Valid and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### **2. Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Verify widget functionality, select, display, persist data.\n- **Findings:** Reads data from ORM, interacts with Selenium, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0, confidence = 1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is a standard test, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **3. Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Automate testing of widget lookup and display.\n- **Findings:** Reads from database and Selenium, no suspicious activity, standard waits.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n- **Verdict:** **Reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### **4. Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Test widget lookup and persistence.\n- **Findings:** Interacts with UI, ORM queries, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard test automation.\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **5. Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Verify widget functionality with Selenium.\n- **Findings:** Reads data, interacts with UI, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0, confidence = 1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious or obfuscated code, standard testing pattern.\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings:**\n- **Code presence:** The code is consistent across reports; no hidden or malicious code detected.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, no obfuscation evident.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, given the nature of the code.\n- **Confidence:** High, as all reports agree.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, since the code is purely testing and no vulnerabilities are apparent)\n\nThe code is a standard Selenium test script for Django admin widgets, with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned by the reports are reasonable and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.** The current scores are appropriate. I would set the overall malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and the security risk at 0 or very close to zero, reflecting the safe and standard testing nature of the script.",
