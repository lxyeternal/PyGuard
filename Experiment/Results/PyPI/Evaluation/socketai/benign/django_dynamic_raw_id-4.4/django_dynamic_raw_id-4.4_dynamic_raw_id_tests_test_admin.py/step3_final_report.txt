  "purpose": "Automated Selenium test suite for Django admin's Dynamic Raw ID widgets, verifying lookup functionality, label display, and persistence of selected values.",
  "sources": "DOM elements for lookup icons, labels, input fields; window handles for popup selection; ORM queries for validation.",
  "sinks": "UI interactions (clicks, window switches), assertions on label text and input values; ORM database queries for validation.",
  "flows": "Click lookup icon -> switch to popup window -> select item -> switch back -> verify label -> save form -> verify persisted values via ORM.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Uses standard testing practices and waits.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard UI automation testing for Django admin widgets, involving window handling, element interactions, and ORM validation. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The interactions are typical for test scripts, with no external network activity or sensitive data handling. The use of implicit waits is standard in testing contexts. ORM queries are used solely for validation, not data exfiltration. Overall, the code is straightforward, well-structured, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Selenium-based test suite for Django admin widgets, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and justified.",
