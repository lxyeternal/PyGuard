{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom Django admin widgets for raw ID fields, handling URL context, rendering, and JavaScript assets for dynamic related object selection.",
  "sources": "The get_context method reads model metadata (_meta), URL reversing, and URL parameter encoding; value_from_datadict reads form data; render constructs HTML output.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is written to files, network, or executed; URL generation and static JS inclusion are safe.",
  "flows": "Data flows from form input (value_from_datadict) to widget rendering, with context data used for URL and JS assets; no external or malicious data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Access to private model members (_meta) is noted but common in Django; no malicious or obfuscated code detected; class attribute overwrite in render could be refined but is not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django widget customization involving URL generation, context setup, and static asset inclusion. It does not perform any network activity, file I/O, or execute untrusted code. Private member access is acknowledged but typical. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to Django conventions indicate a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low risk ~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django admin widget implementation with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and no further action is necessary.",
