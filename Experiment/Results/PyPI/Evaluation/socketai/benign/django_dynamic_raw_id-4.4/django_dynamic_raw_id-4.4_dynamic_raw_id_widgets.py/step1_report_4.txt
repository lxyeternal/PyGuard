{
  "purpose": "To define custom Django form widgets for dynamic raw ID fields in the Django admin interface, supporting single and multiple IDs.",
  "sources": "Input data from HTTP POST requests (`data` parameter in `value_from_datadict`), attribute values (`attrs`), and URL parameters (`url_parameters()` method).",
  "sinks": "URL reverse resolution (`reverse()`), URL encoding (`urlencode()`), JavaScript files included in media (`forms.Media`), and template context variables.",
  "flows": "Data from POST requests flows through `value_from_datadict` to split multiple IDs, then used in rendering HTML, with context variables populated via `get_context`, which includes URLs generated by `reverse()`. The `media` property loads JS files for client-side interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of private members `_meta.app_label` and `_meta.object_name` with inline comments indicating awareness. No hardcoded secrets or credentials found. No obfuscated code or malicious URL manipulations. No suspicious external requests or file operations. The URL generation and context assembly are standard for Django admin custom widgets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom Django admin widgets, primarily for rendering raw ID fields with dynamic features. It uses Django's reverse URL resolution and standard URL encoding. The `get_context` method assembles template context with URLs pointing to admin changelists, which is standard. The media property loads common JavaScript files for admin widgets. The `value_from_datadict` method handles multiple IDs cleanly, and the render method properly joins values. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. All operations are consistent with intended widget customization and include no suspicious external calls or dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard for customizing Django admin raw ID widgets. It does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior. It adheres to typical patterns with no evidence of malware or security risks. The code appears safe and purpose-driven.",
