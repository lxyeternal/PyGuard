  "purpose": "Custom Django widgets for dynamically managing raw ID fields in the admin interface.",
  "sources": "User input via data dictionaries in value_from_datadict method; URL parameters generated via urlencode.",
  "sinks": "URL generation with reverse and urlencode; rendering of HTML with context data.",
  "flows": "Data from form submissions (value_from_datadict) flows into widget rendering; URL parameters are generated dynamically for related URLs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code accesses private members with comments but does not perform any suspicious actions. Use of force_str and URL construction appears standard. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom Django form widgets extending existing widgets, primarily to generate dynamic URLs and handle multiple IDs. It uses standard Django functions like reverse and urlencode without user input sanitization issues, as data is used for URL parameters, not executed as code. There is no evidence of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior. Accessing private members (rel.model._meta) is commented and does not indicate malicious intent. The media property loads JavaScript files necessary for widget functionality. Overall, the code appears to be standard, non-malicious customization of Django admin widgets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard customization of Django admin widgets with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
