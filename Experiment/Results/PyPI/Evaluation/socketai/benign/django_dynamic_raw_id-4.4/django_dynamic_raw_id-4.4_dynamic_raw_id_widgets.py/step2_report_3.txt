  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of custom Django admin widgets for raw ID fields, involving URL generation, JavaScript assets, and form data processing.\n- The code uses standard Django practices, such as `reverse()`, `urlencode()`, and accessing model metadata via `_meta`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or file writes are present.\n- Private member access (`_meta`) is noted but common in Django; comments acknowledge this.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious logic, or malicious code detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Accurate; describes widget customization.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly identified.\n- **Anomalies:** No issues; private member access is noted.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly states benign nature, standard Django pattern.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 0.9 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious activity; private member access is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate assessment; code is standard and safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Private member access is noted but typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Well-reasoned; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.1, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 0.9 — suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of private members is standard in Django; no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states safe, standard code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.1, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 1 — justified.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores fit.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Correct.\n- **Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code; private member access is typical.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly states benign intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code validation:** The code does not contain malicious logic, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero, reflecting minimal security concern, which is reasonable given the code's purpose.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Correctly set to 0.\n- **Confidence levels:** Appropriately high, given the clear, standard code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (minimal security risk, standard widget customization)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, standard Django widget code with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
