  "purpose": "Create a Django migration script that defines a model 'CorsModel' with a 'cors' CharField.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it is a static migration script generated by Django.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only defines database schema.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code is static schema definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; standard generated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django migration script creating a model with an auto-increment primary key and a 'cors' CharField. It is generated by Django 1.10.1, with no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code structure is standard, with no obfuscation or secrets. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code is purely schema definition, and there is no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Django migration script with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
