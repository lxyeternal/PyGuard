{
  "purpose": "Define a Django signal named 'check_request_enabled' to allow custom request handling logic within a Django application.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'django.dispatch' and creates a signal with 'providing_args' parameter.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external communication; the signal is used internally within the application.",
  "flows": "The signal can be connected elsewhere in the application to handle 'request' data, but no data flow occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'providing_args' parameter, which is deprecated in newer Django versions, but not harmful.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django signal declaration, with no malicious or security-compromising behavior. The only minor issue is the deprecated 'providing_args', which does not impact security but affects compatibility. No external data processing, external communication, or obfuscation is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Django pattern for defining signals to enable custom request logic. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minimal security risk score reflects the outdated parameter but does not indicate a vulnerability.",
