  "purpose": "Defines a Django signal for enabling custom request logic.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.dispatch; signal initialization with 'providing_args'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Import source to signal creation; no data flow from external inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'providing_args' parameter (deprecated in newer Django versions), but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports django.dispatch and creates a signal named 'check_request_enabled' with a descriptive comment. No user input or external data is processed. The signal is for internal application logic, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The use of 'providing_args' is outdated but not harmful in itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Django signal definition without any malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and typical for Django applications.",
