  "purpose": "Define a Django signal to trigger custom logic when a request is enabled.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing django.dispatch; creation of 'check_request_enabled' signal.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data handling beyond signal creation.",
  "flows": "Import -> Signal creation; signal potentially invoked elsewhere in application.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'providing_args' parameter which is deprecated in recent Django versions; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's dispatch module to create a custom signal named 'check_request_enabled'. The comment suggests this signal is used to enable custom request logic, which is typical in Django applications. The use of 'providing_args' is outdated but not inherently malicious. There are no input reading points or data leaks; no suspicious data flow or anomalies like obfuscated code or hardcoded credentials. The code is straightforward and appears to be standard signal setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, legitimate setup of a Django signal for enabling custom request logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
