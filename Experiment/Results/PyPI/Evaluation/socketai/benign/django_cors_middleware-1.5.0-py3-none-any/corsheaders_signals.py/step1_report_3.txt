{
  "purpose": "Define a Django signal to indicate whether a specific request is enabled based on custom logic.",
  "sources": "The code imports django.dispatch and defines a signal 'check_request_enabled' with 'request' as a providing argument.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the signal could be connected to handlers that process 'request' objects.",
  "flows": "The code sets up a signal; data flow would occur when the signal is sent and connected handlers process the 'request' argument.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behavior are present. The code is straightforward and standard for Django signals.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Django dispatch module and creates a custom signal named 'check_request_enabled' that provides a 'request' argument. This is a common pattern in Django for decoupled event handling. No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are evident. The comments clarify the purpose, and no malicious or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard, benign Django pattern for custom signals. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
