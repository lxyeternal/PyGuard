  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code snippets.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code: importing `django.dispatch`, defining a signal named `check_request_enabled` with a `providing_args=[\"request\"]` parameter.\n- The purpose across reports is to enable custom request handling logic via Django signals.\n- No reports identify any malicious behavior, external data processing, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The only noted anomaly is the use of the deprecated `providing_args` parameter, which is not harmful but indicates outdated Django usage.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code is straightforward and correctly implements a Django signal.\n- No actual malicious code, data leaks, or external communication is present.\n- The signal is intended for internal application logic, which is typical and safe.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The only technical flaw is the use of `providing_args`, which has been deprecated since Django 3.1. However, this is a version compatibility issue, not a security flaw.\n- No other errors or security issues are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. No malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0.1 or 0, which is reasonable given the code's benign nature. The minimal risk score reflects the outdated `providing_args` but no real vulnerability.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The overall risk is very low; the code is a standard pattern.\n- The small security risk score (0.1) in some reports is acceptable due to the deprecated parameter, but it doesn't introduce actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume no malicious intent and no data flow issues, which is consistent with the code.\n- No claims about potential vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; they are factual.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- All scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0 (or possibly 0.1 if considering deprecated parameter as a minor concern)\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a simple, standard Django signal definition.  \n- No malicious behavior, no external data processing, no obfuscation.  \n- The only concern is outdated syntax, which does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent. The minimal risk score is appropriate, and no changes are necessary.",
