  "purpose": "Define a Django signal to allow custom request handling logic.",
  "sources": "django.dispatch.Signal, request argument in providing_args",
  "sinks": "Potentially any code connected to the signal's listeners that may process untrusted data",
  "flows": "Signal definition (source) to any connected signal handlers (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious function calls, only standard Django signal setup",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Django dispatch module, defines a signal named check_request_enabled, and specifies that it provides the 'request' argument. The signal is used to facilitate custom logic in request processing pipelines. There are no embedded malicious instructions, no data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious external connections. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical Django practices. It does not perform any actions on its own or contain any obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django signal declaration intended for custom request logic. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
