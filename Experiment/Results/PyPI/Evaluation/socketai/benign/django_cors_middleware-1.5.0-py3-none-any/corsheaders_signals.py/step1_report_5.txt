  "purpose": "Define a Django signal for enabling request handling based on custom logic.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'django.dispatch' module and defines a signal object 'check_request_enabled'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that process untrusted input or perform actions based on external data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code simply defines a signal object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and uses standard Django pattern for signal definition. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's dispatch module, which is a standard way to define signals for event-driven communication within Django applications. It defines a signal 'check_request_enabled' that provides 'request' arguments. There are no input processing, data handling, or external interactions that could be exploited maliciously. The code is minimal, standard, and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django signal definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves a purpose in application logic without introducing security concerns.",
