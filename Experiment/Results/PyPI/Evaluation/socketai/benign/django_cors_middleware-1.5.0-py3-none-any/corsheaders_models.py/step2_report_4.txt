  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports Django models and a local signal handler `check_request_enabled`.\n- Defines a simple Django model `CorsModel` with a single `CharField` named `cors`.\n- No dynamic data processing, input handling, or external command execution.\n- The imported signal is not used within this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Finds the code standard, notes the unused import.\n- No malicious behavior or anomalies.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. This aligns well with the analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard Django code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar assessment: straightforward, no suspicious activity.\n- Slightly lower confidence but still high.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 (a minimal security risk due to import, but negligible).\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same reasoning: simple model, import unused.\n- No anomalies or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Consistent with previous: simple, no malicious activity.\n- No anomalies.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Slightly higher security risk score (0.1), possibly due to the import of a signal that could be used downstream.\n- The analysis notes no evidence of malicious behavior, just the import.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** No actual security issue, just a conservative risk score.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all cases, appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0, with one report at 0.1, which seems reasonable given the import of a signal that isn't used here but might be used elsewhere.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is straightforward, standard Django model definition.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The minor risk scores are justified by the import of signals, which in isolation are benign but could be part of larger logic.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0, possibly 0.1 in cases where the imported signal might be used elsewhere, but in this isolated snippet, 0 is appropriate.\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No modifications needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always consider the context in the larger codebase. In this isolated snippet, everything appears safe. If the imported signal is used elsewhere maliciously, that would be outside the scope of this snippet.",
