{
  "purpose": "Define a Django model for storing CORS configuration data",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; imports signals module and defines a model field",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or cause security effects",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is purely declarative",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's models module and a signals module, then defines a simple model with a single CharField. There are no dynamic code executions, input processing, or suspicious constructs. The import of a signals module could imply signal registration elsewhere but does not constitute malicious behavior itself. The code appears to be a straightforward Django model setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django model definition with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
