{
  "purpose": "Defines a Django model named CorsModel with a single CharField to store CORS configurations.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.db and a local signals module; no user input reading in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effects; code primarily declares a model.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; no processing of untrusted data is visible.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code; no obfuscated or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it imports Django's models, a signal handler, and defines a simple model with one CharField. No external data input handling, no unsafe operations, and no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The imported signal may be part of normal application logic, but without its content, it cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code appears standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple Django model definition with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It serves a configuration purpose with no evident security risks.",
