  "purpose": "Define a Django model for storing CORS configuration data",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code imports a local signal module and defines a model field",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only declares a model and imports a signal",
  "anomalies": "Import of check_request_enabled signal which is not used within this snippet; no suspicious or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django model with a single CharField. It imports a local signal but does not connect or invoke it. There are no hardcoded secrets, code injections, or malicious patterns. The import statement for check_request_enabled may be used elsewhere but does not pose a risk in this isolated code fragment. No unusual or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward Django model declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The import of a signal without usage in this snippet is benign.",
