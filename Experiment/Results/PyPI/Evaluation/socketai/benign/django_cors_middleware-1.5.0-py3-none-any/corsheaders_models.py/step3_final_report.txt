{
  "purpose": "Defines a Django model 'CorsModel' with a single CharField 'cors' and imports a signal handler 'check_request_enabled' for potential registration elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Import of 'check_request_enabled' from '.signals', which is unused within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows present; no external data handling or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code is static and does not process input.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'check_request_enabled'; no other anomalies or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django model with an imported signal handler that is not invoked here. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The import may be used elsewhere in the application, but within this snippet, it is benign. No data flows or external interactions are present. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns indicate a low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django model declaration with an unused signal import. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (around 0 to 0.1) due to the import of signals, which is common in Django projects but does not pose a threat in this context.",
