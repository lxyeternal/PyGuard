  "purpose": "Define a Django model for CORS configuration and import a signal for request checking.",
  "sources": "Import of check_request_enabled signal; usage of models.CharField to accept external input",
  "sinks": "No direct sink for untrusted data; no apparent data leak or system effect",
  "flows": "Input via the cors CharField could be used downstream, but no explicit flow is shown here",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. The signal import is standard for Django projects.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django model with a single CharField and imports a signal. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or code injection. The signal import could be part of normal signal handling. No suspicious or malicious patterns are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward Django model definition with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears normal and safe.",
