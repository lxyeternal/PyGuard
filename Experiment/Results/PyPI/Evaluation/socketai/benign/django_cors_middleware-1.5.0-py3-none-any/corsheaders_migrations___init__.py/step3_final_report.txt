{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a benign utility script with no suspicious activity or malicious behavior detected.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and function parameters; no external or untrusted sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed within the script; no untrusted data is sent to network, files, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables and parameters flows through functions without passing to external sinks or performing risky operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with clear data flow from sources (environment variables, parameters) to internal processing. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are detected. The code's simplicity and lack of external communication reduce the likelihood of malicious intent. The confidence in benignity is high (0.9), and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects minimal concern, consistent with the benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The supply chain security posture is sound, and the package can be considered safe based on this review.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
