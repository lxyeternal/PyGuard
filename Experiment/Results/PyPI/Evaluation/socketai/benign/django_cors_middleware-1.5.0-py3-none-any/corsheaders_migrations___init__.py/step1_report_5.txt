  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility script for data processing or configuration, with no explicit malicious intent evident.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as reading environment variables, configuration files, or user input are not clearly present or are minimal.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could be leaked or cause harm, such as network transmission or file modification.",
  "flows": "Data flows seem straightforward, from local variables or inputs to outputs without complex or suspicious pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are apparent. No backdoors or malicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for suspicious patterns, malicious behaviors, or security vulnerabilities. No signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, remote connections, or backdoors, were observed. Usage of third-party libraries is standard, and no anomalies in control flow or data handling are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current analysis, the code does not display signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
