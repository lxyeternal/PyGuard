      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of CORS and CSRF handling with referer management. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The potential security concern lies in configuration-dependent risks rather than code behavior. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3), primarily due to possible misconfiguration rather than malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django model declaration with an unused signal import. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this benign nature, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (around 0 to 0.1) due to the import of signals, which is common in Django projects but does not pose a threat in this context."

The response headers are set in accordance with request headers and configuration, and no suspicious patterns are detected. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and content."

There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The minimal security risk score reflects the outdated parameter but does not indicate a vulnerability."
