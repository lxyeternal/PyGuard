  "purpose": "Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings in a Django application based on user-defined or default values.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration settings from Django's settings module using getattr().",
  "sinks": "None apparent; configuration values are used for setting CORS policies, not executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Configuration settings are retrieved and assigned to variables used elsewhere in the application.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. The code solely defines configuration parameters with defaults.",
  "analysis": "The code imports settings from Django, defines default CORS headers and methods, and assigns configuration options with fallbacks. No dynamic execution, external input handling, or data processing is present. All parameters pertain to CORS policies. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code appears to be standard configuration setup for a Django CORS middleware.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical configuration setup for CORS in Django. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code is safe and standard.",
