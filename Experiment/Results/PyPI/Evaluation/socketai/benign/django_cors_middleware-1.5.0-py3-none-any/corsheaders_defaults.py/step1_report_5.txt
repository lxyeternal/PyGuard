{
  "purpose": "Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings in a Django application, allowing control over which origins, headers, and methods are permitted.",
  "sources": "Settings variables retrieved via getattr from the Django settings module, such as CORS_ALLOW_HEADERS, CORS_ALLOW_METHODS, etc.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code only retrieves configuration values and does not perform any data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Settings variables are fetched from Django settings and assigned to local variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. The code only accesses configuration parameters with defaults. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines default CORS configuration parameters, retrieves optional custom settings from Django's configuration, and assigns them to variables. It uses standard Django functions and constants. No data processing, external network calls, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious intent. All operations are straightforward and typical for setting up CORS policies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration setup for CORS in a Django project, with no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks. It is safe and does not pose any supply chain security threats.",
