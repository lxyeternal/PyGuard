  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing the findings with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward Django configuration module for CORS settings.\n- It uses `getattr()` to retrieve configuration options from Django's `settings`, providing safe defaults.\n- No data is transmitted or processed beyond configuration retrieval.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external code execution.\n- The code does not handle sensitive data or perform any network operations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code appears to be purely configuration, with no evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or suspicious code.\n- The logic and reasoning in all reports are consistent with the code.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical flaws, errors, or security issues are evident.\n- The report summaries correctly identify the code as standard, safe configuration code.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correct given the code clarity.\n- **Security risk:** All assign 0 or very low (0.1), which is reasonable for a configuration module.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is purely configuration with no dynamic or external code execution, a risk score higher than 0.1 is unwarranted.\n- The highest risk score among reports is 0.1, which seems appropriate.\n\n### Any questionable claims?\n- No, all reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based on the code's static nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, safe configuration module.\n- No malicious or suspicious activity detected.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, standard, and poses no supply chain security threat.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
