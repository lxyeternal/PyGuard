  "purpose": "Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings in a Django application based on user-defined or default values.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration values from Django settings using getattr() for various CORS parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads configuration values and defines tuples or defaults, without executing untrusted data or performing sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are retrieved from settings and assigned to variables; no untrusted data flows or processing occurs beyond this.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or malicious behaviors are present. The code purely manages settings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django settings and assigns configuration options related to CORS policies. It uses getattr() to provide default values if settings are not specified, ensuring flexible configuration. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices for configuration management. No sensitive data, environment variables, or external interactions are involved. The structure and content suggest it is a configuration module rather than executable malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for CORS in Django, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It simply reads settings and assigns defaults without executing or exposing sensitive data.",
