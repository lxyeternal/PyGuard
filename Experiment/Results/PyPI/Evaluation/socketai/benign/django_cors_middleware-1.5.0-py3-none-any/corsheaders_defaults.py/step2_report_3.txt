  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and considering the scores assigned.\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Summary**: Correctly identifies the code as purely configuration, with no malicious activity.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.  \n   - **Assessment**: Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Summary**: Similar to Report 1, confirms standard configuration with no malicious behavior.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, risk=0.1, obfuscated=0.  \n   - **Assessment**: The securityRisk is marked as 0.1, which is very low, indicating minimal concern. Given the code's straightforward nature, this seems appropriate. The malware score remains 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Summary**: Same as above, standard configuration, no malicious activity.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.  \n   - **Assessment**: Fully consistent.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Summary**: Same conclusion, standard safe configuration.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.  \n   - **Assessment**: Consistent.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Summary**: Again, standard configuration, no malicious activity.\n   - **Scores**: malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0.  \n   - **Assessment**: Consistent.\n\n**Overall Analysis**:\n- The code is a straightforward configuration module for CORS in Django, with no dynamic code execution, no external data flows from untrusted sources, and no signs of malicious behavior.\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0, with only one report (Report 2) assigning 0.1, which is acceptable given the minimal inherent risk in configuration code.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the clear, standard nature of the code.\n\n**My own assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score**: 0 — configuration code with no security vulnerabilities or risky behavior.\n\n**Final notes**:\n- No changes needed; all scores and conclusions are justified.\n- The code is safe, standard, and does not pose supply chain security threats.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a standard, safe configuration module.\n- No malware or malicious intent detected.\n- Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
