  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare it with the provided code to verify their accuracy and consistency.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward configuration module for Django CORS settings.\n- They emphasize that the code only reads configuration from Django's settings, with no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- The security risk scores are very low or zero, which seems appropriate given the code's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior / Malware Score:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - The code only manages configuration; no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present.\n   \n2. **Code Functionality & Logic:**\n   - The code simply retrieves settings with defaults, no dynamic code execution, no external calls, no input validation issues.\n   - The reports correctly identify this as standard configuration code.\n\n3. **Potential Risks & Security Concerns:**\n   - Since the code relies on external settings, misconfiguration could cause security issues (e.g., overly permissive CORS policies). However, the code itself is safe.\n   - The reports assign a very low or zero security risk, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Obfuscation & Anomalies:**\n   - No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are detected or claimed.\n   - The code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations on Scores:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports is justified.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 is correct.\n- **Security Risk:** Given that misconfiguration could lead to vulnerabilities, but the code itself is safe, the assigned scores (mostly 0 or very low) are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard configuration module with no malicious intent.\n- No evidence supports higher malware or obfuscation scores.\n- The low security risk scores are appropriate, assuming correct usage.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or very close to zero)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent with the code. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard Django CORS configuration module. All reports correctly assess that there are no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
