  "purpose": "Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings in a Django application.",
  "sources": "Settings retrieved via getattr from the Django settings module.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is written or transmitted to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are read from settings and assigned to variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines default CORS configuration parameters such as headers, methods, and other related settings. It uses Django's getattr to fetch configuration options, providing defaults where necessary. The parameters relate to CORS policies, including allowed headers, methods, origins, and other security-related settings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code solely manages configuration data, with no dynamic or external code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module for CORS in Django, with no malicious or suspicious activity detected. It properly defaults to safe configurations and does not handle any sensitive or untrusted data directly.",
