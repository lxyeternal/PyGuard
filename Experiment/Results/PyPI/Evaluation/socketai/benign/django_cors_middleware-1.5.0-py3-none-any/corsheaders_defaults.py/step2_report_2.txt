  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is purely configuration-based, retrieving settings via `getattr` with defaults.\n- No data is transmitted, no external code execution, no input validation beyond defaults.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- The code manages CORS policies, which are security-related but are configured in a standard, safe manner here.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code appears correct and free of vulnerabilities.\n- No malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.\n- The configuration is straightforward and uses safe defaults.\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** No anomalies, no malicious behavior, clear configuration.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n#### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; standard configuration, no suspicious activity.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 (slightly above zero, but justified given the configuration nature), confidence=0.95\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable. Slightly elevated securityRisk due to the potential impact of misconfiguration, but no actual malicious activity.\n\n#### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; standard, safe configuration.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; no anomalies or malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Same; configuration module, no malicious activity.\n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is purely configuration, with no malicious or suspicious activity.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are justified.\n- The confidence levels are high, consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The malware score should remain 0 across all reports.\n- The security risk score should stay at 0, as there's no indication of actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe Django CORS configuration module with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores assigned are appropriate, and I concur with the assessments.",
