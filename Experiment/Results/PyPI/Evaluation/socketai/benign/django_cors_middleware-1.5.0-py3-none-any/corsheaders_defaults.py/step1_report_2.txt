  "purpose": "Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings in a Django project.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration values from Django settings (e.g., getattr(settings, ...)).",
  "sinks": "None; the code primarily reads settings and defines default values, with no direct data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are retrieved from settings and assigned to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. Usage of default values is standard for configuration files.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes default CORS parameters such as headers, methods, and origin policies. It fetches these from the Django settings, allowing customization. The pattern used is typical for configuring security policies and does not include any malicious code or behavior. No input validation issues, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are present. All configurations are static or retrieved from safe, controlled sources. The code is straightforward and purely configuration-based, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django CORS configuration module with no malicious behavior detected. It responsibly sets up CORS policies, relying on settings that can be controlled externally but do not contain any harmful content.",
