{
  "purpose": "This code configures Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings in a Django application by retrieving configuration options from Django's settings module, with sensible defaults. It manages headers, methods, credentials, and other CORS policies.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from Django's settings via getattr() calls for various CORS-related parameters.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or data sinks; the code only retrieves configuration values without processing external input or output.",
  "flows": "The flow is from Django settings to local variables defining CORS policies; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration module for Django CORS settings, using safe defaults and no dynamic or external code execution. It does not handle user input, perform network operations, or process sensitive data. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's simplicity and purpose as configuration justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score. The high confidence level reflects the static, transparent nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Django configuration module for CORS policies. It poses no security risks or malicious threats, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's static and benign nature.",
