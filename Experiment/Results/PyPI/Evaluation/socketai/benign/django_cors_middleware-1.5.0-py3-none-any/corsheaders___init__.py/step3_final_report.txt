  "purpose": "Assign a security assessment to a simple Python version string assignment, confirming it is benign.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment of __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is a standalone assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single line assigning a version string to __version__, with no input/output, functions, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are consistently zero, with high confidence (1). The simplicity and clarity of the code justify these scores. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The code poses no security threat and is typical boilerplate for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string assignment with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and appropriately scored. No further action is necessary.",
