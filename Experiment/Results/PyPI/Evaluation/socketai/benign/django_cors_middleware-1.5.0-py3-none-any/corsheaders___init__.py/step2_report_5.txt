  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment: `__version__ = '1.5.0'`.\n   - There are no signs of data input/output, external interactions, dynamic code, or any suspicious patterns.\n   - The code is standard boilerplate for version declaration in Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify that this is benign, standard code.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The analysis correctly notes the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports agree on zero malware and zero security risk, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - The code is a straightforward version string assignment, a common and safe practice.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n   - There is no malicious behavior, hidden code, or suspicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on direct code analysis, not assumptions.\n   - The conclusion that this code is benign is well-supported.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.** No further action or adjustment is necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the benign nature of the snippet.",
