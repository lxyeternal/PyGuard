  "anomalies": "The code contains only a version string assignment; no anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "This code snippet is a simple assignment of a version string to a variable, a common practice in Python packages. It does not include input handling, external data reading, or any function calls. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident from this minimal content. As such, it poses no security risks and is standard in package versioning.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is typical boilerplate code in Python projects.",
