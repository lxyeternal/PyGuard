  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of CORS and CSRF handling with referer management. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The potential security concern lies in configuration-dependent risks rather than code behavior. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2-0.3), primarily due to possible misconfiguration rather than malicious intent."
