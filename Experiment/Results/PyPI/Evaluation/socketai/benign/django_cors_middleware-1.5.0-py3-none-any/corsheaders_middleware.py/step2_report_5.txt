  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard CORS and CSRF middleware with referer rewriting, no malicious behavior evident.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.45, confidence=0.85.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n- The risk score (0.45) is moderate; it accounts for potential misconfiguration, not malicious intent.\n- The malware score (0) is appropriate.\n- The logic about referer replacement could be misused if settings are misconfigured, but this is a common pattern, not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard CORS middleware, handles headers, referer rewriting, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No obfuscation or malware.\n- Low risk score aligns with the description.\n- The code is typical for CORS handling.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Manages CORS headers, referer, whitelists, regex, signals; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is standard.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Signal usage is a common pattern for extendability, not malicious.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** CORS middleware with origin validation, referer handling, whitelists, regex; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No malicious code or obfuscation.\n- The logic is typical for CORS middleware.\n- No suspicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard CORS handling, origin validation, referer modification, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- All points align with standard practices.\n- No signs of malicious payloads or sabotage.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.2 to 0.45). The higher (0.45) in Report 1 reflects potential misconfiguration risk, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The **malware scores** are accurate and should remain at 0.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are accurate at 0.\n- The **risk scores** are reasonable; given the code's nature, they should stay low, perhaps around 0.2–0.45 depending on perceived misconfiguration risk.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk:** 0.2–0.4 (considering potential misconfiguration or header manipulation, but no malicious intent)\n\n**In conclusion,** the reports are consistent, and the scoring aligns with the code's behavior. No significant adjustments are necessary.",
