  "purpose": "The function provides metadata about the 'apache-airflow-providers-facebook' package, including version info, integrations, hooks, connection types, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads external input or data sources; it primarily returns static information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only returns a dictionary with static data.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a generated, static function that returns package metadata. No suspicious or unusual code, such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic, is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static Python function returning a dictionary with package metadata, dependencies, and configuration details. It contains no input handling, no external data access, and no dynamic execution or obfuscation. It appears to be part of a larger package setup and is typical for auto-generated metadata files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static metadata function with no malicious intent or security issues. It is a standard component of package information. No security risks are identified.",
