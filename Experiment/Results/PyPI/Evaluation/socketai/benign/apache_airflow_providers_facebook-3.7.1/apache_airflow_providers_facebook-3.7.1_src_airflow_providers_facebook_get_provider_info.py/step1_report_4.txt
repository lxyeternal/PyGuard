  "purpose": "Provides metadata and configuration details for the Apache Airflow provider package for Facebook Ads integration.",
  "sources": "No input data sources or external data reads within the code; static return of package info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks or external system manipulations occur.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the function simply returns a static dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated elements, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code appears to be a straightforward static data provider.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static function returning hardcoded metadata about the package, including name, description, versions, dependencies, and integrations. It contains no input handling, dynamic code execution, or network operations. The structure and content are typical for package metadata and configuration files, with no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard auto-generated configuration function for a Python package. It poses no security threat, malware, or malicious intent. It is safe and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
