  "purpose": "This code provides metadata and configuration details for the Apache Airflow Facebook provider package, including version info, integrations, hooks, connection types, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as version lists, integration info, and dependency specifications. No external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks. The code does not execute or handle untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "The code simply returns a static dictionary; no data flow from source to sink exists, nor does it involve dynamic or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be boilerplate, auto-generated, with no obfuscated patterns or unusual constructs. All variables and data structures are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration function returning a dictionary with package metadata. It does not perform any I/O, network requests, or data processing that could be malicious. The presence of version info, dependency declarations, and integration metadata is typical for a Python package setup. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The only potential concern could be dependencies, but they are standard package dependencies specified for functionality, not malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign metadata function for a Python package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears to be part of an auto-generated package description with no suspicious elements.",
