  "purpose": "Provides metadata information about the 'apache-airflow-providers-facebook' package, including versions, integrations, hooks, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only contains static function returning hardcoded data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that could lead to data leaks or security issues, as the code does not handle untrusted input or perform operations like network access or file writing.",
  "flows": "The function get_provider_info() returns a static dictionary, with no flow of untrusted data or dynamic processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is straightforward, auto-generated, and contains no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is an auto-generated static Python function returning a dictionary with package metadata, dependencies, and configuration details. It does not process external data, does not execute dynamic code, and lacks any suspicious or malicious patterns. It appears to be part of a package metadata system, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a metadata provider for a package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. It is a safe and standard auto-generated package descriptor.",
