{
  "purpose": "Provides static package metadata for the 'apache-airflow-providers-facebook' package, including version info, integrations, hooks, connection types, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static data within the function get_provider_info() returning a dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data inputs; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; purely static return of metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated function returning a static dictionary with package metadata. It contains no external input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The data is static and well-structured, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate benign static configuration data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static package metadata with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
