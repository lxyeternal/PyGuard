{
  "purpose": "This module provides a Python hook for interacting with the Facebook Ads API within an Airflow environment, enabling automated ad report retrieval.",
  "sources": "Data is read from Airflow connection configuration (`get_connection` method), Facebook Ads API responses, and connection extra fields (`extra_dejson`).",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data such as access tokens, app secrets, or account IDs are handled, but only within the API and connection objects; no data leaks or external untrusted outputs are observed.",
  "flows": "Config data flows from Airflow connection to API configuration; report requests flow from method calls to API endpoints; async job status polling flows from Facebook API responses back to the report retrieval process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The use of sleep in polling is standard for async workflows.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a Facebook Ads reporting hook for Airflow, with proper configuration checks and API interaction patterns. It reads connection info securely from Airflow's connection system, handles asynchronous report status polling, and manages multiple accounts if configured. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are evident. It strictly uses provided API SDKs and standard Python libraries. The logic appears transparent, with no signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API interaction module with no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It adheres to expected patterns for such integrations. Risks could stem from misconfigured credentials or API misuse outside this code, but the code itself appears safe.",
