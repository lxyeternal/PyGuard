{
  "purpose": "This module provides a Python hook for interfacing with the Facebook Ads API within an Apache Airflow environment, enabling data extraction and report generation.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from the Airflow connection's extra fields (`conn.extra_dejson`) to obtain credentials and account information.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to write untrusted data directly to external systems or files. It uses API calls to Facebook's servers and handles report data internally.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from connection extras to internal methods for API initialization. API responses from Facebook are polled in a loop until completion, then processed into report objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are present. The code correctly handles missing config fields and manages API polling. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly initializes the Facebook Ads API using credentials fetched from Airflow connection settings, avoiding hardcoded secrets. It performs standard API polling for asynchronous report generation, with proper status checks. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or code injection are detected. The use of `time.sleep()` for polling is standard. The code is well-structured and aligns with expected API interaction patterns. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and standard implementation of a Facebook Ads reporting hook for Airflow. It securely retrieves credentials, interacts with the Facebook API as intended, and manages report polling appropriately. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
