{
  "purpose": "The code defines package version compatibility checks and imports related to Apache Airflow, specifically for the Facebook provider package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version from the imported airflow.__version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a RuntimeError if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which could potentially halt execution but is not malicious.",
  "flows": "The code compares the parsed airflow.__version__ to a minimum required version, and raises an error if the condition is not met.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present. The code is standard for version compatibility checks, with no hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports version parsing utilities and the Airflow version, then checks if the current Airflow version is less than 2.9.0. If so, it raises a RuntimeError informing about the minimum required version. The code is well-structured, uses standard library and package imports, and performs version validation. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code appears to be an automatic generated boilerplate for package compatibility validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version check for compatibility, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions solely to enforce version requirements before proceeding.",
