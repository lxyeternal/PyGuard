{
  "purpose": "This code defines package version validation and imports related to the Apache Airflow project, primarily for ensuring compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables via imported modules and retrieves the Airflow version string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules, parsing version strings, and raising an exception if conditions are not met. Data flows from imported version info to validation logic.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The only potential concern is the use of version parsing and runtime exception, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script imports version information, compares the installed Airflow version with a specified minimum version, and raises an exception if the requirement is not met. All operations are standard for dependency validation. No suspicious or malicious behavior, code injection, or privacy violations are observed. The code appears to be a normal part of package validation scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs version validation for the Airflow package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard dependency check script with safe operations.",
