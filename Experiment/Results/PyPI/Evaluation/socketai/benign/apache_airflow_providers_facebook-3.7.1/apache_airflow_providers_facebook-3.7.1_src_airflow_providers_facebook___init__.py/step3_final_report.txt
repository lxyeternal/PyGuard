  "purpose": "Performs a version check to ensure the installed Apache Airflow version meets the minimum required version (2.9.0). Raises RuntimeError if the version is below this threshold.",
  "sources": "airflow.__version__ imported from airflow package",
  "sinks": "Raises RuntimeError if version check fails",
  "flows": "airflow.__version__ is parsed and compared to a fixed version string; no untrusted data flows or external outputs",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward and auto-generated, with no suspicious or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code imports airflow.__version__, parses it twice redundantly, and raises an exception if the version is below 2.9.0. It is a standard dependency validation snippet with no external inputs, network activity, or obfuscation. The logic is correct, and no anomalies or malicious behaviors are present. The code is typical for dependency enforcement and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated dependency version check with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe and standard implementation.",
