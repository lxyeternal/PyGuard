{
  "purpose": "This code manages version compatibility for an Apache Airflow provider package, ensuring that the installed Airflow version meets the minimum required version.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Airflow version via the import from airflow.__version__.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted input or perform any dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "The flow involves parsing the Airflow version and comparing it to a minimum version threshold to potentially raise an error.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears to be a standard version check script with typical import and comparison logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, retrieves the current Airflow version, and checks if it meets the minimum required version (2.9.0). If not, it raises a RuntimeError. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious imports, hidden behaviors, or obfuscated elements. It appears to be an auto-generated configuration or validation script with a clear purpose, and no malicious intent or risky operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard version compatibility check for an Apache Airflow provider package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It is a benign, well-structured validation script.",
