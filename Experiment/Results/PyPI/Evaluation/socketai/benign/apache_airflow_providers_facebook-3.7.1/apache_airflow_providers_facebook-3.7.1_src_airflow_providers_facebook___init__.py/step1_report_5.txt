{
  "purpose": "This code verifies the environment's Airflow version and raises an error if it does not meet a minimum requirement, likely for compatibility purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the current Airflow version from the imported __version__ attribute of the airflow module.",
  "sinks": "The version comparison and potential RuntimeError raise do not involve untrusted data or external inputs; they are static checks within the code.",
  "flows": "The source (airflow_version) flows into a version comparison check, which may trigger an exception if the condition is met.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed. The code appears to be a standard version check with a conditional exception throw, typical for dependency validation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, sets a version string, and performs a version check against the current airflow version. If the airflow version is below 2.9.0, it raises a RuntimeError. There are no external inputs, user inputs, or dynamic code execution. The code appears to be straightforward and standard for dependency validation, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical dependency version check for ensuring compatibility, with no indications of malicious activity. It performs static checks and exception raising based on the airflow version, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
