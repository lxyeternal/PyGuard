{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be an auto-generated module for a Python package, primarily handling version compatibility checks and licensing information for Apache Airflow providers.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported module 'airflow' for its version information, and the 'packaging.version' module for version parsing.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the RuntimeError being raised if the Airflow version is below 2.9.0, which is a safe and expected control flow.",
  "flows": "Version information from 'airflow' is read, parsed, and compared; if the condition is met, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, or hidden behaviors; the code is standard for version compatibility enforcement.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, involving import statements, version comparison, and a conditional exception. It contains licensing comments and auto-generation notices. No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated behavior is evident. It performs a typical runtime check to ensure compatibility of package dependencies.\n\nNo hardcoded credentials, network connections, or other malicious patterns are present. The logic is clear, safe, and aligned with standard software practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated version compatibility check with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as intended to prevent incompatible package versions from being used. There is no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected.",
