  "purpose": "This code snippet contains only licensing comments with no executable code or data processing, serving as boilerplate license information.",
  "sources": "N/A (comments only, no data input or external sources)",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data flow, no untrusted data handling)",
  "flows": "N/A (no source-to-sink data flows, as there is no executable code)",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data processing, or suspicious patterns; only licensing comments present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments typical for open-source projects, with no executable statements, data input/output, or embedded scripts. There are no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the content. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely licensing boilerplate with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores of malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
