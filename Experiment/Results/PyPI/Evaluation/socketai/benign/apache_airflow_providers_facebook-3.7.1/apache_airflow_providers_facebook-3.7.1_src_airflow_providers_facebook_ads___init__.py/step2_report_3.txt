  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the provided code is solely licensing comments with no executable logic.\n- The analysis in each report states that there are no data flows, no input/output, no suspicious or malicious code.\n- The confidence levels are all at 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n- The obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk scores are all 0 across reports, aligning with the conclusion that there is no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Confirmations and Validations:**\n- The code snippet is purely comment-based licensing headers; no executable code, data processing, or network activity.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or embedded scripts are present.\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent and sound.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n- Since the reports uniformly conclude no security issues, and the code is just license comments, there is no reason to adjust scores.\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0; there is no indication of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0; no obfuscation is present.\n- The overall security risk score is appropriately 0, as there are no vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes or adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the understanding that the code is purely licensing boilerplate with no security implications.",
