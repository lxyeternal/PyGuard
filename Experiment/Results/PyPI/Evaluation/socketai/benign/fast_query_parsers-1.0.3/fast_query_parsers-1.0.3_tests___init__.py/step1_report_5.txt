  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script that performs data processing or utility functions. There are no explicit comments indicating malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (e.g., sending data), file writes, executing system commands, or handling sensitive data such as credentials.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions, environment variables, or file reads to sinks like network sockets, file outputs, or system commands. The flow details depend on specific code operations observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected. No backdoors or hidden behaviors apparent. Code structure appears straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for security issues, including hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious operations. No such indicators were found. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard. The flow of data does not suggest malicious manipulation or data exfiltration. No unsafe SQL or insecure environment variable usage was observed. The code's behavior aligns with legitimate purposes.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be benign, with no evidence of malware or suspicious anomalies. Confidence in this conclusion is high given the thorough examination.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
