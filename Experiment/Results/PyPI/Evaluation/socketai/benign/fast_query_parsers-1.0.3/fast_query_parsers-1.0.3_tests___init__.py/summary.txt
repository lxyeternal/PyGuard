  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with low malware and obfuscation scores. Reports indicating suspicious patterns, especially dynamic execution and network activity, are assigned higher scores. The main adjustment is increasing Report 3's malware score to 0.6 to better reflect its moderate suspicion. Scores are consistent with the described behaviors, and further static/dynamic analysis is recommended for confirmation."
