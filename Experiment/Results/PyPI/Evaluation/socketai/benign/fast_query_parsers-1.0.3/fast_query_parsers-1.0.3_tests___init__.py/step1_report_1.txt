{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that imports standard libraries and performs basic data processing or utility functions, likely for application support.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, user input, and potentially external files or network data if used elsewhere in the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing output, writing to files, or network transmission if present in the full code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input, through processing functions, towards sinks like output statements or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code features are evident. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries without obfuscated or suspicious constructs. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden backdoors are detected. It does not handle untrusted input in a way that indicates security risks, nor does it perform unsafe operations like insecure SQL or unsafe eval calls. The absence of network activity or system modifications reduces concern for malware. The code appears to serve a benign purpose based on the provided fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility or support script with no malicious intent or suspicious anomalies.",
