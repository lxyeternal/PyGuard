  "purpose": "This code provides functions for parsing URL-encoded form data and benchmarking various parsing methods using the pyperf library.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the encoded_data parameter in parse_url_encoded_form_data, and the hardcoded URL-encoded query data (url_encoded_query).",
  "sinks": "The data flows into JSON decoding within parse_url_encoded_form_data and parsing functions, but these are controlled and do not involve untrusted external inputs.",
  "flows": "Input bytes are decoded and parsed through standard library functions or custom parsing functions; no untrusted data flows into system commands or sensitive system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present. All parsing functions are standard and safely handle input. Benchmark functions are for performance testing only.",
  "analysis": "The script defines data parsing functions for URL-encoded data, including handling JSON-encoded values. It uses standard parsing libraries and suppresses JSONDecodeError to handle JSON data gracefully. Benchmark functions are used for performance comparisons. No external inputs are read dynamically from insecure sources; all inputs are either function parameters or predefined constants. No code injections, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are evident. The code appears straightforward and well-structured with no suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard URL-encoded data parsing and benchmarking without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or suspicious behaviors. The overall security risk is minimal.",
