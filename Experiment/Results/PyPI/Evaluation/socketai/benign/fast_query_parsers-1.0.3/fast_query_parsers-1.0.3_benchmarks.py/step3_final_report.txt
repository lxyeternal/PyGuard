{
  "purpose": "The code benchmarks URL-encoded parsing functions, including standard library and custom implementations, without external network activity or handling sensitive data.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded URL-encoded byte string, function parameters for parsing functions",
  "sinks": "In-memory parsed dictionaries, no external data flow or leakage",
  "flows": "Input bytes decoded and passed to parsing functions, results stored in local variables",
  "anomalies": "Use of suppress(JSONDecodeError) for JSON parsing errors, which is standard and benign",
  "analysis": "The code performs URL-encoded data parsing and benchmarking, with no external communication, secrets, or malicious patterns. JSONDecodeError suppression is a common pattern for robustness. No obfuscation or suspicious code is present. The data is controlled, and the purpose is performance measurement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purpose-specific, and free of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The security risk score can be set to 0, reflecting minimal risk.",
