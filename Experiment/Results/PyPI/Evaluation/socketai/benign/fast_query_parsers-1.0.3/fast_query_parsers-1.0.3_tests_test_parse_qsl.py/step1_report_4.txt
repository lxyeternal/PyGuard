  "purpose": "Unit tests for the parse_query_string function, verifying correct parsing behavior with various delimiters, inputs, and encodings.",
  "sources": "Test input strings (qs), encoded byte strings, function arguments like qs and separator, URL-encoded values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is used in a dangerous manner; the code only tests parsing functions.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed to parse_query_string, which processes URL-encoded data; no data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard use of testing frameworks and URL parsing functions. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no external data flows that could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of test cases using pytest to validate the behavior of parse_query_string. It tests different delimiters, special characters, encoded values, non-ASCII text, and function parameters. The functions used are from well-known libraries (pytest, urllib.parse). There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The functions tested do not process untrusted data in a way that would pose a security risk; they only perform parsing and validation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of benign unit tests for a parsing function, with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It simply verifies correct parsing logic across various scenarios.",
