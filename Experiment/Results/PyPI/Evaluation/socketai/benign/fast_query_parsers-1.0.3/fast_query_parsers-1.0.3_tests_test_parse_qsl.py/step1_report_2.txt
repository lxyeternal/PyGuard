{
  "purpose": "The code defines unit tests for the 'parse_query_string' function from the 'fast_query_parsers' library, verifying its correctness across various inputs and separators.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include URL-encoded strings passed directly to the test functions, notably via the 'qs' variables and the 'qs.encode()' method calls.",
  "sinks": "Data flow is primarily within the test assertions comparing 'parse_query_string' output to 'parse_qsl' results; no external data sinks or external system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are passed into 'parse_query_string', which processes the data; the results are compared to expected outputs from 'parse_qsl'. No data is transmitted externally or stored.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code consists solely of test cases for a parsing function without dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is a set of comprehensive unit tests for URL query parsing, covering various separators, special characters, non-ASCII characters, and multiple input cases. It uses standard libraries like 'pytest' and 'urllib.parse', with no external data flows or security-sensitive operations. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are evident. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs safe and standard unit testing for a query parsing function. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is well-structured and focused solely on validation of expected behavior.",
