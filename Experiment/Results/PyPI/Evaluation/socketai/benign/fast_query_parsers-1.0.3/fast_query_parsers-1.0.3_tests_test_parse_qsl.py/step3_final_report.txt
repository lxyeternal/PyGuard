  "purpose": "Unit tests for the parse_query_string function, validating URL query parsing with various delimiters, encodings, and special characters.",
  "sources": "Test input strings provided via parameterized test cases, encoded query strings.",
  "sinks": "Internal parsing functions; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed by parse_query_string; no external sinks or data leaks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward unit tests for URL query string parsing, covering multiple delimiters, special characters, and encodings. It uses standard libraries and functions, with no external network or file operations. The tests are designed to validate correct parsing behavior. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's purpose is purely validation, and the data flows are internal and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for URL query parsing, with no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, standard validation script.",
