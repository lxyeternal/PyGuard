{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of predefined electromagnetic frequency and waveguide objects for use in RF and microwave engineering simulations or calculations.",
  "sources": "The code creates Frequency and RectangularWaveguide instances via property methods in the StaticInstances class. Data is hardcoded for waveguide frequency bands and physical dimensions.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks that send untrusted data to external systems or perform sensitive operations. No network, file, or environment variable access beyond simple object instantiation.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves property accesses that return predefined Frequency or RectangularWaveguide objects with fixed parameters. No dynamic data or untrusted input is processed.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive hardcoded constants for frequency bands and physical dimensions. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors are detected. No secrets, credentials, or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward module that provides predefined RF component parameters. It uses property decorators to instantiate objects with fixed values. No external inputs, network calls, or sensitive operations are present. The overall structure is clear, with no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and serves as a reference or utility module for RF engineering parameters. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. Its purpose is to provide standard waveguide and frequency objects, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
