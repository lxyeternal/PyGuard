{
  "purpose": "Provides predefined RF frequency and waveguide objects for standard waveguide bands, serving as a static resource for RF/microwave engineering calculations.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded data within property methods returning Frequency and RectangularWaveguide instances; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Static creation of object instances; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Minor inconsistency in string casing ('ghz' vs 'GHz') in some Frequency definitions; no security relevance.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with numerous property methods returning predefined Frequency and RectangularWaveguide objects based on industry standards. It contains no dynamic code execution, external dependencies, or data handling. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and serves as a static constants repository. No obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors are present. The data is hardcoded, referencing standard RF bands and dimensions, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static resource module for RF components, posing no security threat or malware risk. It is transparent, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
