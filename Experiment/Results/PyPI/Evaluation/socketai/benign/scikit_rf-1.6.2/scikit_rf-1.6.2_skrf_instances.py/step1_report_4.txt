{
  "purpose": "Defines a class StaticInstances to create and provide predefined instances of frequency and waveguide objects for common waveguide bands, primarily for use in electromagnetic simulations or calculations.",
  "sources": "Property methods in StaticInstances class creating Frequency and RectangularWaveguide objects; imported modules (.constants, .frequency, .media).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; the code does not perform data output, network communication, or system modification based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Accessing attributes of StaticInstances (via __getattr__) triggers creation of Frequency or RectangularWaveguide objects; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code consists mainly of object property definitions and straightforward object creation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a StaticInstances class with properties that instantiate Frequency and RectangularWaveguide objects for standard waveguide bands, based on reference data. It also includes a singleton _instances and a dynamic attribute accessor __getattr__ for external access. There is no evidence of data injection, network activity, or malicious code. The structure is consistent and standard for a configuration or constants module, with no obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign configuration module that provides predefined electromagnetic component instances. No malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. It functions solely to supply static data objects.",
