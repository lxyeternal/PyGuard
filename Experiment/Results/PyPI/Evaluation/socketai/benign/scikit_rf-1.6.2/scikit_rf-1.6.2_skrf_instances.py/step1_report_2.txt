  "purpose": "Define and provide access to predefined frequency and rectangular waveguide instances for standard waveguide bands used in RF engineering.",
  "sources": "Property methods that instantiate Freespace, Frequency, and RectangularWaveguide objects.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; the code mainly creates and returns object instances with hardcoded parameters.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code solely provides predefined, static objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code is straightforward, using fixed values for object creation.",
  "analysis": "The module defines a class StaticInstances with multiple property methods that instantiate and return objects representing waveguide bands and media. These properties return objects with fixed parameters, such as frequency ranges and waveguide dimensions, all hardcoded. The class is instantiated once and accessed via a custom __getattr__ method, which delegates attribute access. No user input, external data, or dynamic code execution is involved. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The code strictly serves as a static repository of predefined RF components.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static data repository for RF waveguide parameters. It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It simply provides predefined instances for use in RF simulations or calculations. The overall security risk is minimal.",
