{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class StaticInstances that provides predefined instances of frequency and rectangular waveguide objects for use in RF/microwave simulations or calculations, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from property methods within the StaticInstances class, primarily creating Frequency and RectangularWaveguide objects with hardcoded parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in the code; it does not handle or transmit untrusted data, nor does it perform external communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code simply instantiates objects internally without any data flow to external systems or networks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code straightforwardly defines constants and object properties.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of property methods returning predefined instances of Frequency and RectangularWaveguide objects with fixed parameters. No input handling, external communication, or dynamic code execution is observed. The purpose appears to be providing a structured, reusable set of RF component definitions. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module designed for RF engineering purposes, providing predefined frequency and waveguide instances. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. All code is straightforward and intended for internal use within a larger application or library.",
