{
  "purpose": "Define a singleton-like class providing predefined instances of frequency and waveguide objects for standard waveguide bands used in RF/microwave engineering.",
  "sources": "Attribute accessors within the StaticInstances class, returning instances of Freespace, Frequency, and RectangularWaveguide objects.",
  "sinks": "None evident; code does not process untrusted input, nor does it perform network operations, file I/O, or other common malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "Accessing attributes of the module dynamically via __getattr__, which delegates to the StaticInstances singleton to return predefined objects.",
  "anomalies": "The code defines a large number of hardcoded frequency ranges and physical waveguide dimensions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious code patterns are present. No credentials, secrets, or data leakage mechanisms are found.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured, static set of RF component instances, used for convenience in RF/microwave simulations or calculations. It does not process external input, execute system commands, or perform network operations. The dynamic attribute access via __getattr__ only returns predefined objects, with no indication of malicious intent. No code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is straightforward and appears purely for defining constants and object instances related to RF components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module that supplies predefined RF frequency and waveguide objects for use in other parts of a larger application. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this module.",
