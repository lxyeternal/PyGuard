{
  "purpose": "Provides a Frequency class and associated functions for handling and manipulating frequency bands, including plotting, slicing, and overlap calculation.",
  "sources": "Imports standard modules (re, warnings, numpy) and internal modules (.constants, .util, .plotting). No external input sources are explicitly read in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks in the code that process untrusted input data or perform potentially dangerous operations such as network access, file operations, or code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve creation and manipulation of frequency arrays (f, f_scaled) within the Frequency class, primarily through arithmetic operations, slicing, and property calculations. No external data flow or untrusted input handling is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. The code uses warnings and exception handling appropriately. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden behavior are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Frequency class that manages frequency vectors and units, with methods for creation, slicing, comparison, arithmetic operations, and plotting. It includes warnings for non-monotonic frequencies and supports flexible frequency unit conversions. The overlap_freq function calculates the overlapping frequency range between two Frequency instances. No external inputs, network communications, or file operations are present. The code appears to be a well-structured, legitimate utility for frequency management without any indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for frequency handling in scientific or engineering applications. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The implementation is clear, with appropriate warnings and data validation. Overall, it is safe and does not pose a supply chain threat.",
