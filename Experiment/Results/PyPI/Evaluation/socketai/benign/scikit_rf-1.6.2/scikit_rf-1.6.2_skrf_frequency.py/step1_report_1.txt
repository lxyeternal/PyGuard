{
  "purpose": "Provide a class and functions to handle frequency ranges and related operations in signal processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements for numpy, re, warnings, and internal modules; class and function definitions; property and method implementations within the Frequency class.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified that handle untrusted data or could leak information directly. No code writes data over networks, interacts with files, or uses environment variables maliciously.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows to untrusted sources or external systems. Frequency data is internally generated or from user inputs in string format, but no external sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or hidden functionalities. Usage of regular expressions for string parsing is standard. No hardcoded credentials or secret data. Warnings and error handling are appropriate. No obfuscated code or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a Frequency class to manage frequency ranges, including creation from parameters or from an explicit frequency vector. It includes standard mathematical operations, properties for frequency metrics, and plotting functions. The implementation appears conventional, with proper handling of units, monotonicity checks, and slicing. No signs of malicious intent, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors, are evident. The code relies on user-provided string inputs for slicing, which is handled carefully with regex parsing. All imports are from standard or internal modules, and no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of a frequency management class with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate utility module for signal processing purposes.",
