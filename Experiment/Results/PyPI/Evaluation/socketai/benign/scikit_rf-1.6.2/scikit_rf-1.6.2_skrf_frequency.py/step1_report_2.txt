{
  "purpose": "Provides a class for handling frequency bands and related functions, including creation, slicing, and plotting of frequency data.",
  "sources": "Reads input from constructor parameters, class methods like from_f, and string parsing in __getitem__ for slicing.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls or file writes; plotting functions use matplotlib but do not perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from constructor parameters or from_f to internal frequency array; slicing interprets string input to create frequency slices; plotting visualizes frequency data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs observed. Use of regex in __getitem__ for parsing frequency strings is standard. No suspicious code injection or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of a Frequency class with methods for creating, copying, slicing, and plotting frequency data. It includes checks for monotonic increase, supports unit conversions, and provides properties for frequency attributes. The only potential concern could be string parsing in __getitem__, but it is standard for handling human-readable frequency ranges. No network access, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior detected. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate scientific utility module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a frequency handling utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It safely handles frequency data, supports slicing and plotting, and does not contain hidden or suspicious logic.",
