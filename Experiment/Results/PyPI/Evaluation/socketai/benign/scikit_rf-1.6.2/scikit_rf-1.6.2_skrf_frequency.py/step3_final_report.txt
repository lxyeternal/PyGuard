{
  "purpose": "Provides a frequency object and related functions for RF/signal processing, allowing creation, slicing, plotting, and overlap calculation of frequency ranges with unit management.",
  "sources": "User input strings for slicing, frequency vector data, internal calculations, and regex parsing for string interpretation.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network communication, or file operations; primarily internal data manipulation and plotting.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed via regex to interpret frequency ranges; frequency data flows through class methods for slicing, operations, and plotting without external system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; regex parsing is standard and safe; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured utility class for managing frequency data, with features like unit conversion, slicing, plotting, and overlap calculation. It uses regex for user-friendly slicing, which is a common pattern. No external system calls, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The class includes validation and warnings for non-monotonic data but does not perform any malicious actions. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1) are consistent with the code's benign and utility nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure utility for frequency management with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal risk score reflects the standard nature of the implementation.",
