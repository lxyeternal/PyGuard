{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class for calculating loaded and unloaded Q-factors of resonators from S-parameters, along with related analysis and visualization methods.",
  "sources": "Reads data from a Network object (ntwk) including its S-parameters and frequency data; uses internal methods for fitting and computation; no external data input is explicitly read during execution.",
  "sinks": "Potential data sinks include returning calculated Q-factors, resonant frequencies, and S-parameters; no data is sent over the network or external connections; no file writing or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Sources (ntwk data) flow into calculation methods (_initial_fit, fit, _optimise_fitX); computed parameters (Q_L, f_L, etc.) flow into visualization and property methods; no external data or untrusted input flows into security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution present. The methods perform standard numerical computations and data analysis. The class relies on standard numpy linear algebra routines and data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard numerical fitting routines for resonance analysis using well-known equations from microwave engineering literature. It does not include any network connections, file I/O, or external data transmission. All data flows are internal, from input Network object to output parameters or fitted models. No anomalies or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network communication are present. The code appears to be a legitimate scientific computation module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a typical scientific analysis tool for RF engineering, specifically for analyzing resonant behaviors in S-parameter data. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It uses standard numpy routines and straightforward numerical methods. Overall, it is safe and focused solely on resonance analysis.",
