{
  "purpose": "This module provides tools for estimating and analyzing Q-factors of microwave resonators from S-parameter data, including fitting, calculation of Q-circle parameters, and network modeling.",
  "sources": "Reads S-parameter data from a Network object, frequency data, and optional initial estimates (Q_L0, f_L0).",
  "sinks": "Uses fitted parameters to compute Q-factors, resonance frequencies, and network responses; no untrusted data writing or external data transmission detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the Network object and frequency data into the Qfactor class; the class performs calculations and fits, producing results like Q_L, f_L, and network models, but no data is sent externally or stored maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. No use of unsafe eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code features are present. No hidden or malicious network connections are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured Python class for Q-factor analysis in microwave engineering. It implements multiple fitting methods and calculates parameters based on physical models. All functions operate on input data or internal variables without external data transmission, command injection, or insecure operations. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are detected. The code adheres to standard scientific computation practices and uses numpy for linear algebra. The only potential concern could be the use of np.linalg.solve, but it is a standard numerical method with no malicious intent. Overall, the code appears legitimate and purpose-driven for its domain.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific tool for microwave resonator analysis. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are present. It performs calculations based on standard physical models and numerical methods without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
