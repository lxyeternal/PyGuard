  "purpose": "The code implements a scientific library for estimating the Q-factor of microwave resonators from S-parameters, involving data fitting, parameter extraction, and network modeling.",
  "sources": "Reads input from Network objects, specifically S-parameters and frequency data; no external data transmission or file I/O.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; all data processing is internal within the Python environment.",
  "flows": "Input Network data flows into internal calculations; no network activity or external communication occurs; computations involve linear algebra routines on numpy arrays.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected. Uses standard scientific computing libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is purpose-built for microwave engineering analysis, performing standard calculations for Q-factors and resonance parameters. It relies on numpy for linear algebra, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external data leaks. The structure is clear, domain-specific, and consistent with scientific modeling. No external network activity, file access, or dynamic code execution is present. The code is readable, purpose-driven, and employs standard numerical methods.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific library for microwave resonator analysis, with no indicators of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It operates solely on internal data, with transparent logic and standard practices. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
