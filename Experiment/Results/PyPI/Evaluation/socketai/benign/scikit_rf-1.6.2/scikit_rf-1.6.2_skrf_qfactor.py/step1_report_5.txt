  "purpose": "Library for estimating and analyzing the Q-factor of microwave resonators from S-parameters, including fitting, visualization, and calculation of related parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from a Network object (specifically s-parameters and frequency data), and internal parameters during fitting and calculation methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to internal attributes like Q_L, f_L, and fitted parameters; uses numpy.linalg.solve for matrix computations; no untrusted data outputs or network transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (s-parameters, frequencies) flows into methods such as _initial_fit and fit, which process data to produce fitted parameters. These parameters are used internally for calculations like Q_unloaded and Q_circle, and for generating modeled s-parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or covert behaviors. The code performs complex mathematical modeling consistent with physics-based Q-factor analysis. No unusual or obfuscated language features; the code is well-structured and domain-specific.",
  "analysis": "The code is a domain-specific library implementing established physical models for resonator Q-factor estimation. It performs data fitting, calculations, and provides utility methods for visualization and analysis. All computations are mathematically justified, with no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The usage of numpy.linalg.solve and standard numerical methods is appropriate for the task. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated sections. The structure and comments align with scientific computation standards.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, domain-specific implementation of Q-factor estimation for microwave resonators. It contains no malicious behavior or sabotage signals. It relies on mathematical models and numerical linear algebra to perform its functions. Overall, the code is benign and intended for scientific analysis, with no indications of malware or security risks.",
