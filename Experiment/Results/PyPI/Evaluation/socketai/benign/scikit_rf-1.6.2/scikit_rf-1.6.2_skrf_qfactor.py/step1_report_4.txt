  "purpose": "Library for estimating and analyzing Q-factors of resonators from S-parameters, including fitting methods and equivalent circuit modeling.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the Network object (self.s, self.f), and from method parameters like opt_res and A.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that would lead to data leakage, code injection, or malicious data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from Network objects and method parameters through fitting functions, with internal calculations for Q-factor estimation and modeling.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs numerical fitting, property calculations, and model fitting, consistent with its purpose. No obfuscated code features or unusual language constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and methods for Q-factor analysis, including fitting routines, property calculations, and network modeling. It performs numerical computations based on the input Network object, using numpy for linear algebra and complex calculations. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or system modification code is present. The functions use standard numerical methods for fitting and analysis, with no signs of malicious intent. The initial part sets up constants, imports, and classes, while the main class Qfactor offers functionality for model fitting, response simulation, and Q-circle analysis. The methods operate solely on provided data and internal calculations, with no indications of hidden or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured, domain-specific library for Q-factor analysis of resonators based on S-parameters. It relies on standard numerical methods and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior. No malicious payload, backdoors, or malicious data handling routines are detected. The overall security risk score is low, with high confidence that the code is safe.",
