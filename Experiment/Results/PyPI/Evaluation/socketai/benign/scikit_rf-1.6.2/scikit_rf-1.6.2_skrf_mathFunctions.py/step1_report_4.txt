{
  "purpose": "Provides mathematical functions and utilities for signal processing, matrix operations, and complex number manipulations, primarily for use in scientific or engineering computations.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; functions operate on passed parameters such as arrays, matrices, or complex numbers.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent to external systems, network, or files; functions return computed mathematical results locally.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., arrays, matrices, complex numbers) flow through mathematical functions and transformations; no external data flows or network interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code behavior observed; functions perform standard mathematical operations. The code contains utility functions for mathematical and matrix operations without hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code offers a wide range of mathematical utilities: complex number conversions, phase unwrapping, matrix property checks, eigenvalue manipulation, and interpolation. All functions use standard numpy/scipy operations, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. The presence of functions like 'rand_c' generates random complex numbers but does so in a typical manner using numpy's RNG. No code indicates external communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The functions operate purely locally, focused on mathematical computation. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. Overall, the code appears legitimate and consistent with scientific computing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a collection of mathematical utility functions for complex numbers, matrices, and signal processing. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious network activity, or security risks. The functions perform standard operations without signs of sabotage or malware. The likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.",
