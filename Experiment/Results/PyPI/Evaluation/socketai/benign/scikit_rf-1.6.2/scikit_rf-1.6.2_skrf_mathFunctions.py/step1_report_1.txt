{
  "purpose": "The code provides a collection of mathematical functions, conversions, and utility operations primarily for complex number manipulation, matrix analysis, and spectral processing, intended for scientific or engineering applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as complex numbers, arrays, matrices, and frequency spectra. It does not read from external files, network, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "The code processes and returns mathematical transformations and data structures. No sinks are present that could leak data or perform harmful operations; it does not write to external systems, files, or network.",
  "flows": "Input data (complex numbers, matrices, spectra) are processed through mathematical functions, conversions, or matrix operations. There are no external data flows such as network calls or file I/O. Data transformations are local and purely computational.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspiciously unusual code patterns are present. All functions perform standard mathematical operations. No obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are identified. Usage of numpy/scipy is typical for scientific computing.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly contains mathematical and utility functions with clear purposes, such as complex number conversions, matrix property checks, spectral processing, and eigenvalue adjustments. No code appears to perform external communications, data exfiltration, or system modification. Functions like 'rand_c' generate random complex arrays but are typical in simulations. No indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or hidden backdoors are present. The presence of mathematical constants, spectral functions, and matrix analyses are consistent with scientific computing tasks. All operations seem safe, with no signs of malicious payloads or exploits.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard library of mathematical and utility functions intended for scientific or engineering applications. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious anomalies. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious system interactions. All functions perform legitimate computational tasks with no external side-effects or network activity.",
