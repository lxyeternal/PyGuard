{
  "purpose": "Provides various mathematical functions, conversions, and utilities for complex numbers, matrices, and signal processing, primarily used in scientific or engineering contexts.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reading operations are present; functions operate on parameters passed to them.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system modification are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; functions process data in-memory without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed; the code implements standard mathematical and signal processing operations without hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or privacy violations.",
  "analysis": "The code contains numerous mathematical functions for complex number manipulation, matrix analysis, and signal processing. It includes utility functions like null space computation, matrix checks, eigenvalue nudging, and rational interpolation. All functions perform standard numerical computations with no signs of data exfiltration, malicious communication, or covert activities. No hardcoded credentials, secret keys, or external system interactions are present. The functions are self-contained and designed for mathematical processing only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of scientific and mathematical utilities with no malicious intent. It performs in-memory data manipulation and analysis, with no indicators of supply chain attacks, sabotage, or malware activities. The overall security risk score is very low.",
