{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for transmission line theory calculations, including impedance, reflection coefficients, propagation constants, and related electrical parameters.",
  "sources": "Functions receive inputs such as frequency, impedance values, and electrical lengths. Inputs are primarily user-provided parameters or function arguments. No external data sources are explicitly read within the code.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any code that writes or transmits data to external systems, networks, or files. No clear data exfiltration or malicious data flow is present.",
  "flows": "The functions process input parameters to compute electrical quantities. There are no flows that lead to untrusted data being sent externally or to perform harmful actions. The main data flow involves mathematical transformations of provided parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard for electromagnetic and RF engineering calculations. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present. No suspicious use of environment variables, insecure SQL, or code injection points are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of mathematical functions related to transmission line physics, impedance transformations, and wave propagation. It uses numpy and scipy for numerical calculations. Functions are well-structured with clear documentation and parameters. No evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks is observed. The code performs standard calculations, and the mathematical operations are typical for such domain-specific functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard mathematical library for transmission line analysis with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. It is unlikely to be used as malware or pose security threats. It appears to be a legitimate component for RF engineering computations.",
