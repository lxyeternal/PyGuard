  "purpose": "This module provides functions related to transmission line theory, impedance calculations, reflection coefficients, propagation constants, skin depth, surface resistivity, and voltage/current propagation, primarily for RF engineering and electromagnetic analysis.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as frequency, resistivity, permeability, load impedance, characteristic impedance, and electrical length; no external data or network inputs.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are numerical calculations of physical quantities; no data exfiltration, network activity, or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through mathematical functions to produce impedance, reflection coefficients, propagation constants, and related quantities; internal computations are standard and do not involve external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward, well-documented, and uses standard scientific formulas.",
  "analysis": "The code implements well-known physics formulas for skin depth, surface resistivity, impedance transformations, reflection coefficients, and voltage/current propagation, using numpy and scipy constants. It handles complex numbers appropriately, includes edge case handling (e.g., INF for infinite impedance), and avoids dynamic code execution or external data access. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or obfuscation are present. The functions are transparent, with clear purpose and standard implementation, indicating a benign scientific library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent scientific library for transmission line and RF physics calculations. It shows no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), consistent with its purpose as a physics computation module.",
