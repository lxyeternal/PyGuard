{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for transmission line calculations, including impedance, reflection coefficients, propagation constants, and related electrical parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as frequency, impedance values, electrical length, and material properties (rho, mu_r).",
  "sinks": "Calculation outputs such as skin depth, surface resistivity, propagation constants, reflection coefficients, and impedance transformations. No data is sent externally or to network endpoints.",
  "flows": "Inputs are read from parameters; computations involve mathematical functions (sqrt, log, exp, etc.) leading to derived parameters; no external data or untrusted sources are processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. The code performs standard physics and electrical engineering calculations. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names are detected.",
  "analysis": "The module strictly contains mathematical functions relevant to transmission line theory and electromagnetic properties. The functions include standard formulas from physics and electrical engineering with proper parameter handling. The code typecasts inputs to arrays for vectorized operations, which is common and not suspicious. No external network or file I/O, no command execution, and no suspicious data handling is observed. The code comments and structure are clear, and all functions serve well-defined scientific purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or covert data access are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard scientific/engineering library implementing transmission line calculations. It appears to be a benign, well-structured module without malicious intent or security risks.",
