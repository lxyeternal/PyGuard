  "purpose": "Provide functions related to transmission line theory, including calculations of impedance, reflection coefficient, electrical length, and related physical quantities.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as frequency, impedance values, electrical length, and material properties; uses numpy for calculations.",
  "sinks": "Performs mathematical operations to compute physical properties; no indications of data leakage or malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed and transformed through mathematical functions; no data flows to external systems or networks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of INF as a placeholder for infinite load impedance is standard. The code appears to be purely computational with well-defined functions, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution, or misleading variables.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a comprehensive set of functions for transmission line calculations, such as skin depth, surface resistivity, impedance conversions, electrical length calculations, reflection coefficient calculations, and voltage/current propagation. All functions utilize numpy for numerical operations and appear to perform standard physics and engineering calculations related to transmission lines. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious system interaction. Usage of mathematical constants, array operations, and function definitions follow legitimate scientific programming practices. The code structure is clear and well-documented, with no suspicious or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward implementation of transmission line physics calculations. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It is a standard scientific library for electrical engineering computations with no security risks identified.",
