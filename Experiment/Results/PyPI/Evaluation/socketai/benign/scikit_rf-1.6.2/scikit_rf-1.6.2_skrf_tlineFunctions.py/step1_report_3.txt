{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for transmission line theory calculations, including impedance, reflection coefficients, propagation constants, and related physical properties.",
  "sources": "Uses standard scientific libraries (numpy, scipy.constants), internal math functions, and constants; no external input reading detected.",
  "sinks": "Returns calculated electromagnetic and transmission line parameters; no data output to external systems or network connections identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows are confined within mathematical computations and conversions, transforming inputs like impedances, reflection coefficients, and physical parameters into derived quantities.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs present. Functions are typical for physics calculations with standard mathematical operations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs physics-based calculations related to transmission lines, such as skin depth, surface resistivity, impedance transformations, and wave parameters. It utilizes numpy and scipy for numerical operations, handles complex numbers properly, and includes typical mathematical models and conversions. No signs of code injection, hidden network activity, or malicious behavior. No unusual code patterns or obfuscation. The functions appear well-structured for their purpose, with proper handling of edge cases like infinities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific library for transmission line calculations with no evidence of malicious intent. It is solely dedicated to physics computations and does not perform any external communications or manipulations that could harm or compromise a system.",
