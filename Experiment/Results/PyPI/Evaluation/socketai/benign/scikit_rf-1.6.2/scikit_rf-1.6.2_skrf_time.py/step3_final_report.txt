{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for peak detection, span detection, windowing, and time gating of RF network data, primarily for signal analysis and manipulation within the 'skrf' library.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'ntwk' object attributes such as 's_time_db', 'frequency', and 's', as well as input parameters for gating and window functions.",
  "sinks": "Manipulates 'ntwk.s' parameters internally; no external data transmission or leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from network attributes through processing functions (peak detection, span detection, windowing, FFT-based gating) and back into the 'ntwk' object after modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Uses standard libraries and techniques. Warnings are appropriately used for deprecated units or missing parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard signal processing routines for RF analysis, including peak detection based on derivatives, thresholding, and minimum distance constraints; span detection via peak separation; window generation via scipy.signal.get_window; and time gating through FFT-based convolution or multiplication. All operations are confined within the 'ntwk' object, with no external communication or malicious constructs. The peak detection function is sourced from a known open-source license, and no obfuscation or suspicious behavior is present. The overall structure and logic are consistent with legitimate RF signal processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of RF signal analysis functions with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain attack. It is safe for use in open-source projects and does not pose security risks.",
