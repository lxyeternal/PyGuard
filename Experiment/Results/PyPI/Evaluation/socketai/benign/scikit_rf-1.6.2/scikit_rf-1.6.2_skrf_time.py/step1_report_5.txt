{
  "purpose": "This module provides time domain functions for signal processing, including peak detection, span detection, window generation, and time gating of network parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from Network object properties such as ntwk.s_time_db, ntwk.s_time_mag, ntwk.frequency.t, and ntwk.f. Reading parameters from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writing back modified network data into ntwk.s[:, 0, 0], performing FFT/IFFT operations, and generating windows for gating.",
  "flows": "Input data from Network object properties flows through peak detection and span detection functions, then through window functions, and finally into signal processing steps involving FFT/IFFT to perform gating. Modified data overwrites parts of the Network object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code. Use of warnings for deprecation and missing t_unit input is typical. No suspicious network connections, data exfiltration, or file operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs signal processing tasks typical in RF and signal analysis, such as peak detection, windowing, and time gating. It uses well-known libraries (numpy, scipy) and standard methods. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns, no hidden network or system operations. All modifications are confined to in-memory data manipulations within the Network object, with no external communications or unauthorized data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of time-domain signal gating and peak detection functions. There is no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage. It appears to be a safe and standard signal processing module.",
