  "purpose": "Initialize the skrf package by importing modules, setting up optional dependencies, and configuring plotting environment based on environment variables.",
  "sources": "Module imports, environment variables (SKRF_PLOT_ENV), optional dependencies (vi, data), dynamic attribute access (__getattr__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence plotting setup; optional dependencies are imported conditionally; __getattr__ accesses internal instances.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __getattr__ to expose internal instances; optional imports wrapped in try-except; environment variable for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package initialization tasks: importing submodules, handling optional dependencies safely, and configuring plotting based on environment variables. The use of __getattr__ allows dynamic access to internal instances. No network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The optional imports and environment variable handling are common practices. The code structure is clear and intended for benign setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign package initialization script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are consistent: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 (reflecting benign environment variable and optional dependency handling).",
