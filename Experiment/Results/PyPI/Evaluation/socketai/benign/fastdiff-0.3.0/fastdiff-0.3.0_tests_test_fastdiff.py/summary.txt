  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard, benign test suite with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The call to native initialization routines is typical and not suspicious. The current security scores are justified and should remain at zero malware, zero obfuscation, and a very low risk score (~0.1)."
