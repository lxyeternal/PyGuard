  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Summary of findings across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently identify this as a standard, benign setup.py script for the 'fastdiff' package.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected.\n- The code reads local files for descriptions, defines dependencies, and calls setup()—all standard procedures.\n- No external data flows, network activity, dynamic code execution, or embedded secrets are present.\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Confirming issues in the code:**\n- The code is straightforward and standard; no issues are present.\n- No signs of malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Review of scores:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and securityRisk = 0.\n- These are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential points of contention:**\n- None identified; the reports are aligned and accurate.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a typical setup script with no security concerns.\n- The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, and the scores are justified. No adjustments needed.",
