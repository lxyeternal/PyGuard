{
  "purpose": "Standard setup script for the 'fastdiff' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files for long description; defines dependencies in 'requirements' list; static package metadata in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network activity; no dynamic code execution or external inputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, standard setup script with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that reads local files for descriptions, specifies dependencies, and calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata. No dynamic code, external data, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the script. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected or implied. The code adheres to best practices and contains no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
