  "purpose": "The script is designed to facilitate the setup and installation of the 'fastdiff' Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and configuration details.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'README.rst' and 'HISTORY.rst' files for long description; loads requirements from predefined lists; retrieves package data and metadata directly from the script variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the script does not process untrusted data or execute code that could lead to data leaks or security breaches.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads ('README.rst', 'HISTORY.rst') into variables; these are used in the setup() function to configure the package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code follows standard Python package setup practices. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures using setuptools, reading description files and defining package metadata. It specifies dependencies and classifiers appropriately. No suspicious or malicious code, external network interactions, or security risks are present. The code appears clean and intended solely for package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It reads package metadata from local files and sets up the package configuration accordingly.",
