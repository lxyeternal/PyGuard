  "purpose": "Define the top-level package structure for 'fastdiff', importing the 'compare' function.",
  "sources": "Module-level metadata (__author__, __email__, __version__), import statement from .compare.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions on external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input or sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code serves as a simple package initialization file. It imports a function from a relative module and sets metadata variables. No user input handling, network communication, or data processing occurs here. The import of 'compare' might involve sensitive operations, but nothing in this snippet indicates malicious intent. All content appears standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
