{
  "purpose": "Define the top-level package for 'fastdiff' and expose the 'compare' function",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local compare module, metadata variables (__author__, __email__, __version__)",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data could be leaked or maliciously exploited",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no user input handling or external data processing present",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual patterns; straightforward package initialization",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets package metadata and imports a compare function from a local module. No external data processing, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no security-sensitive operations are present. It appears to be a standard, benign package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign package module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a simple package setup without any suspicious elements.",
