  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports agree that the code is a straightforward `__init__.py` file, setting package metadata and importing a local `compare` function. There are no indications of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The code is benign and aligns with standard Python package practices.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is simple, with no external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no security-sensitive operations. No errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign a confidence of 1, with malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores all at 0. This seems appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports indicate no malicious behavior, the risk score should remain at 0. The code does not perform any actions that could be considered risky or malicious.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is consistent with the code's content. No malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports are cautious and based on observed code structure. They do not assume malicious intent beyond what is visible, which is appropriate.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis—no suspicious activity, no external data flow, and no obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, benign package initialization file with no security risks or malicious elements. The reports are accurate and thorough.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is entirely safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores reflect this assessment accurately.",
