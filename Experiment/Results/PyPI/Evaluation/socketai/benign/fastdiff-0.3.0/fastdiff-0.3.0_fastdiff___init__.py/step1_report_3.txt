  "purpose": "Define the top-level package for 'fastdiff', exposing the 'compare' function from a submodule.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .compare import compare",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs present",
  "flows": "N/A, as there is no data flow involving untrusted sources or sinks",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, and no malicious constructs. Metadata appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package init file. It imports a function 'compare' from a relative module, sets package metadata such as author, email, version, and defines __all__ for export. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code constructs. The code serves a simple packaging purpose and contains no potentially malicious or anomalous behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign package initialization file with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply exposes a compare function from a submodule and defines package metadata.",
