{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer for the 'fastdiff' library, importing the 'compare' function and setting package metadata.",
  "sources": "No external sources; only local imports and metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; code is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, clear, and standard for a Python package __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package __init__.py that defines metadata and imports a local function. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The code does not process untrusted input, nor does it contain obfuscation or suspicious patterns. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No modifications are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package initialization file with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as safe.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
