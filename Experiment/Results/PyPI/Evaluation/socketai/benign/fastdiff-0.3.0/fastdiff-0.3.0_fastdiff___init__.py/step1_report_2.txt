{
  "purpose": "Top-level package initialization for 'fastdiff', mainly exposing the 'compare' function.",
  "sources": "Imports from the relative module '.compare'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data being written to files, network, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Import of 'compare' from the local module; no data flow indicating untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns. The file is minimal and standard for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package __init__.py file, defining metadata and exposing modules. No external data input or untrusted sources are involved. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The structure and content align with standard practices for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initializer with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply exposes the 'compare' function for external use.",
