  "purpose": "Configuration script for building project documentation using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys, and fastdiff; reads project metadata and configuration options.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file operations involving untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Imports and uses fastdiff to get version info; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscated code or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file, setting up project info, themes, paths, and documentation options. It inserts the parent directory into sys.path and imports 'fastdiff' to retrieve version info. There are no dynamic code execution, network connections, or handling of untrusted input. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present. Overall, this is a typical configuration script with no indications of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Sphinx configuration file used for documentation setup. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It is safe for use and does not pose any supply chain threat.",
