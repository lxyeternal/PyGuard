{
  "purpose": "The code loads a WebAssembly module and provides functions to allocate strings in WebAssembly memory, retrieve strings, and compare two strings using the WebAssembly module.",
  "sources": "File system read for 'fastdiff.wasm'; input parameters 'string' for allocate_cstr; function calls to instance.exports methods.",
  "sinks": "Memory manipulation functions; calling exported WebAssembly functions; deallocating memory; decoding output bytes.",
  "flows": "Input strings are converted to bytes, allocated in WebAssembly memory, then passed to 'compare' function, which returns a pointer to the result; output is retrieved and decoded; deallocation occurs afterward.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are apparent. The code reads from a file, allocates memory, and invokes WebAssembly functions, which are standard for such interactions. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a WebAssembly module and manages memory to compare two input strings using the module's exported functions. It handles memory allocation, string conversion, and memory cleanup appropriately. The functions and flow are straightforward and typical for WebAssembly integrations. There are no signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code performs standard operations for a WebAssembly-based comparison utility, with no suspicious network activity or credential handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard WebAssembly integration for string comparison, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It responsibly manages memory and uses the WebAssembly module for its intended purpose without evident security risks.",
