{
  "purpose": "This code loads and interacts with a WebAssembly module ('fastdiff.wasm') to perform comparison operations on input strings.",
  "sources": "Reading the WebAssembly binary file ('fastdiff.wasm') from disk, and input strings passed to 'compare' function.",
  "sinks": "Memory operations in WebAssembly instance, specifically in allocate_cstr, get_cstr, and deallocate functions, as well as the return of comparison results.",
  "flows": "Input strings are converted to bytes and written into WebAssembly memory via allocate_cstr, then comparison results are retrieved from WebAssembly memory and decoded.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code behavior detected. Usage of memory views and external WebAssembly module appears standard. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. WebAssembly functions 'allocate', 'compare', and 'deallocate' are used appropriately; no indication of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a WebAssembly module and provides functions to allocate strings into the module's memory, perform comparisons, and retrieve results. It manages memory properly with allocate and deallocate functions, and reads the module binary securely from disk. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. It performs straightforward memory management and function calls to a WebAssembly module, which appears to be a standard use case. No malicious behavior or sabotage signs are detected. The only notable aspect is the reliance on an external WebAssembly file, but that alone is not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a normal interface to a WebAssembly module for string comparison. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code performs expected operations securely and correctly, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
