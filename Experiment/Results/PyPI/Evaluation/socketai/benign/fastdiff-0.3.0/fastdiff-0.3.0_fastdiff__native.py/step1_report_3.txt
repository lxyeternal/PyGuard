{
  "purpose": "This code loads and interacts with a WebAssembly module to perform string comparison operations, managing memory explicitly.",
  "sources": "Reading the WebAssembly binary from 'fastdiff.wasm' file; reading input strings in allocate_cstr function.",
  "sinks": "Calling exported functions 'allocate', 'compare', and 'deallocate' on the WebAssembly instance; converting output bytes to string.",
  "flows": "Input strings are converted to bytes and passed to 'allocate' to get pointers; pointers are used in 'compare'; output pointer is used to retrieve result; deallocation occurs afterward.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code, or unusual code structures; straightforward memory management; no external network activity or system modification observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a WebAssembly module and exposes functions to allocate memory, compare strings via the WASM module, and retrieve results. Memory management is explicit, with careful deallocation. The process appears legitimate, focusing on string comparison. No code injection, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The module 'fastdiff.wasm' is loaded from disk; its contents are unknown, but the code treats it as a standard WASM module. The functions do not contain obfuscation or malicious logic. All data flows are contained within the module and local functions, with no external network or system calls beyond standard file I/O for the WASM binary.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard WebAssembly loading and string comparison operations securely, with no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. It manages memory explicitly and uses the WASM module for comparison logic. No suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
