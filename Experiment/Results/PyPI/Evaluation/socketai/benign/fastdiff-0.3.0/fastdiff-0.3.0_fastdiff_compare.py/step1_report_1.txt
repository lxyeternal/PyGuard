  "purpose": "Main module for importing a 'compare' function from either a native or base implementation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_native and _base).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; only module imports and error handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily import logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a bare except clause; this can suppress useful error information but is common in fallback mechanisms. No malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a 'compare' function from a native extension (_native). If that fails, it falls back to a base implementation (_base). The use of a bare except could hide underlying errors, but it is not inherently malicious. No external inputs, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's structure is straightforward, and no obfuscation or suspicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module import with fallback, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor concern is the bare except clause, which could hide import errors, but it does not pose security threats.",
