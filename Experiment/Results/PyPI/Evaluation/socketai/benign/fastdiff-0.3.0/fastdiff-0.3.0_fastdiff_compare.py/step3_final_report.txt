  "purpose": "Attempt to import 'compare' from a native extension, with a fallback to a base implementation if the native import fails.",
  "sources": "Import statements within the try-except block.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; purely module import logic.",
  "flows": "Import from ._native or ._base depending on success or failure.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a broad 'except:' clause which can mask import errors.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'compare' from a native extension, falling back to a base implementation upon failure. The broad except clause can hide underlying import issues but is a common pattern for fallback mechanisms. No malicious code, external communications, or data leaks are present. The code is straightforward and intended for optional native extension usage. The risk of malicious behavior is negligible; the main concern is error masking, which does not constitute a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The only minor concern is the broad exception clause, which could be refined but does not pose a security risk. Overall, the supply chain component is safe.",
