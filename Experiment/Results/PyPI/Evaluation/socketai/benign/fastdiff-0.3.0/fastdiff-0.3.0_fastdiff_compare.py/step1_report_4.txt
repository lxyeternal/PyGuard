{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports a 'compare' function from a native extension or a fallback base implementation.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements from the current package/module (__native__ or __base__).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data processing or untrusted data handling; it only performs conditional imports.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as no data flow occurs beyond import logic.",
  "anomalies": "The broad except clause captures all exceptions without specific handling, which can mask underlying issues but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a 'compare' function from a native module. If that fails (any exception), it falls back to importing from a base module. This pattern is common for providing optimized native extensions with a fallback. The broad exception handling could mask import errors, but it does not introduce malicious behavior. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward conditional import pattern used to enhance performance or compatibility. There are no signs of malicious intent or malware within this snippet.",
