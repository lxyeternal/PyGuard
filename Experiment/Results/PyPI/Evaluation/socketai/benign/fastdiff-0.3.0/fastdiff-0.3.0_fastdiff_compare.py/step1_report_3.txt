{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a main module that attempts to import a function named 'compare' from a native extension module, with a fallback to a base implementation if an error occurs.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements and the __all__ variable declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or data handling are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the only flow involves attempting to import modules.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a broad except clause without specifying exception types is a potential concern, as it suppresses all errors, possibly hiding import failures or other issues. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages module import fallback logic. The try-except block catches all exceptions when importing 'compare' from a native module and defaults to importing from a base module. The broad exception handling could mask issues, but it is a common pattern for fallback strategies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard fallback import pattern without any malicious intent or security concerns. Its primary purpose is to ensure the 'compare' function is available regardless of import success. No malware or security risks are detected.",
