  "purpose": "Import and expose the 'compare' function from a native module or a fallback base module.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a broad except clause without specifying exception types is a potential anomaly, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'compare' from a native module. If the import fails, it falls back to importing 'compare' from a base module. The fallback mechanism is straightforward. The broad except clause might suppress specific import errors, which is a code quality concern but not malicious. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. No obfuscated or malicious code is present. The code is minimal and primarily concerned with module import handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module import fallback pattern with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The use of a broad except is a potential concern for error handling but does not indicate malicious activity.",
