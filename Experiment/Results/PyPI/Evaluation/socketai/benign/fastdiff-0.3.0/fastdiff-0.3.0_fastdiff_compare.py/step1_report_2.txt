{
  "purpose": "The code serves as the main module for a package, providing an import fallback mechanism for the 'compare' function.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statements, specifically attempting to import 'compare' from a native extension or falling back to a base implementation.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks or data handling points where untrusted input could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: attempt to import 'compare' from a native module; if that fails, import from a base module.",
  "anomalies": "The broad except clause captures all errors during import without logging or error handling, which is unusual and could be used to hide import issues, but not malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a native extension module, and if that fails, it defaults to a base implementation. The use of a broad except clause is generally discouraged but is not inherently malicious; it may be for robustness. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The structure and purpose are typical for fallback import strategies in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import fallback pattern with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The broad exception handling is a potential code smell but not malicious. Overall, the code appears benign.",
