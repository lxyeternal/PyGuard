  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a straightforward import fallback pattern, attempting to import 'compare' from a native extension, with a fallback to a base implementation.\n- All reports correctly identify the broad except clause as a potential code smell but not malicious.\n- No evidence of data leaks, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior is present.\n- The code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code logic matches the description; it attempts to import a function, with fallback.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities related to data handling, input validation, or security flaws are evident.\n- **Error handling:** The broad except could hide import errors, but it’s a common pattern for fallback.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Issue Evaluation:\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports correctly identify the broad except clause as a potential concern but not malicious.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n  - **obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with code clarity.\n  - **securityRisk:** Slightly varied, mostly 0.1 or 0.2, reflecting minor concerns about error handling, which seems reasonable.\n  - **confidence:** 0.9, indicating high confidence in the benign nature.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent across reports.\n- The minor security risk scores could be slightly lowered to 0.05, considering the benign nature, but 0.1-0.2 is acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n- The malware score should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, as the code is clear.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **malware:** 0\n- **obfuscated:** 0\n- **risk:** 0.1 (average of the reports' scores, reflecting minor concern about broad exception handling)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with no malicious intent or behavior. The main concern is the broad except clause, which could mask import errors, but this is a common pattern and not inherently dangerous.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. I agree with the scores assigned, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall risk is minimal, and the code is considered safe.",
