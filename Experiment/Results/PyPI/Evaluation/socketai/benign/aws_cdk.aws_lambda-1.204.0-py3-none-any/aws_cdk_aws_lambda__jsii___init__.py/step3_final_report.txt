{
  "purpose": "This code sets up AWS CDK modules, loads a jsii assembly, and publishes the construct, typical for infrastructure deployment scripts.",
  "sources": "Module import statements, jsii assembly load, and publication.publish() call.",
  "sinks": "The publication.publish() may trigger deployment workflows but does not directly lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Imports and assembly load lead to the publish call; no untrusted data flows or network activity are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for AWS CDK setup.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements, assembly loading, and a publish call. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources. The assembly load references a specific AWS CDK package version, and the publish function is typical in packaging workflows. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified; the risk score is minimal, reflecting operational deployment steps rather than security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard infrastructure setup code with no malicious intent or supply chain security issues. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
