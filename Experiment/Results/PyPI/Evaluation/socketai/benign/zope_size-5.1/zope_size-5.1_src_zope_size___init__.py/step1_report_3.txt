  "purpose": "Provide an adapter to determine the size of an object in bytes, and display it in human-readable form.",
  "sources": "The constructor of DefaultSized reads the getSize() method from the input object.",
  "sinks": "The size value computed in the constructor is used in byteDisplay, which formats and translates size strings.",
  "flows": "Input object -> getSize() method -> constructor -> sizeForDisplay() -> byteDisplay() -> translation functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors are present. Usage of translation functions is standard for i18n. No obfuscation detected. The code seems straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that attempts to retrieve an object's size via getSize(). It handles exceptions gracefully. The byteDisplay function formats size values into human-readable strings and uses internationalization functions. No external data is read besides getSize(), and no data is sent externally or manipulated maliciously. The use of try-except blocks prevents crashes but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign and typical for an internationalized sizing utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of an adapter pattern for size measurement and display. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident. It appears safe and well-structured.",
