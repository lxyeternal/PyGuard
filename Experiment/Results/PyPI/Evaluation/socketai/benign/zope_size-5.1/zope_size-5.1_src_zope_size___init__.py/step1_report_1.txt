  "purpose": "Provide size information for objects by implementing the ISized interface with display and sorting functionalities.",
  "sources": "obj.getSize() method call in __init__ of DefaultSized class.",
  "sinks": "sizeForDisplay() uses internationalization functions (_), but no untrusted data sinks directly lead to security risks.",
  "flows": "The size is retrieved from obj.getSize() and then used in byteDisplay() for display purposes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code uses standard library and well-known modules.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an adapter class that calls obj.getSize() to determine the size of an object. It handles exceptions gracefully and formats the size for display with internationalization support. The byteDisplay function converts raw byte sizes into human-readable formats with correct units. The use of translation functions (_), standard exception handling, and simple calculations indicate typical application code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a size adapter with internationalization support. No signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malicious code are present. The code is benign and intended for size measurement and display.",
