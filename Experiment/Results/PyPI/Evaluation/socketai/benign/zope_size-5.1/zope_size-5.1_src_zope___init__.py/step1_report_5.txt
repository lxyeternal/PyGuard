  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "__import__('pkg_resources')",
  "sinks": "declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "flows": "Import pkg_resources -> Call declare_namespace with __name__",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; use of __import__ is standard for dynamic imports",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the pkg_resources module and calls its declare_namespace method with __name__ to declare a namespace package. This is a common practice in Python packaging for modular packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The code does not process untrusted input nor performs any network or system modification actions. It appears to be a standard namespace declaration statement. No obfuscation or hidden code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward namespace declaration using pkg_resources, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
