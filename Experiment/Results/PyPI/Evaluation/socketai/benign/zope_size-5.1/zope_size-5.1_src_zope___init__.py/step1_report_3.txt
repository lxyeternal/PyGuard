  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "Import statement that loads the 'pkg_resources' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' leads to calling 'declare_namespace' with __name__.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of '__import__' for dynamic import; no additional anomalies or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module dynamically using __import__, then declares the current package as a namespace package with 'declare_namespace(__name__)'. This is a common pattern for namespace packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code. The code's structure is minimal and standard for namespace declarations.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves a legitimate purpose of defining a namespace package without any malicious intent or security issues. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
