  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package for modular distribution in Python using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "No external data input or user input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leakage or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as the code only declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and typical for namespace declaration; no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and uses 'declare_namespace' to set up a namespace package. This is a standard pattern for Python namespace packages, especially in package distributions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden code. The comment indicates no coverage, which is typical for such setup code. No external communication, data exfiltration, or dangerous operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration for Python packages and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign setup snippet.",
