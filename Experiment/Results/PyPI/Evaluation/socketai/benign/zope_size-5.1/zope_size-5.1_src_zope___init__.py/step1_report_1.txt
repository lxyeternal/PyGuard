  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, allowing multiple distributions to share the same namespace.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely performs namespace declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; use of __import__ with a string argument is standard for dynamic imports. No suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module dynamically using __import__, then calls 'declare_namespace' on __name__ to set up namespace sharing. This is typical in Python packaging for namespace packages. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code is concise and follows common pattern for namespace declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for declaring a namespace in a Python package. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
