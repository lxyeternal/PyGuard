  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "The import statement that loads 'pkg_resources' and the declare_namespace function call",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code is simply declaring a namespace without data flow",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, but use of 'declare_namespace' can sometimes be associated with namespace packaging; no suspicious activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module from setuptools and declares the current package as a namespace package. This is a common pattern for defining namespace packages in Python, especially for plugin or extension systems. There are no apparent data flows, input handling, or external communications. The code is static and straightforward, with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors. The purpose is solely to facilitate package namespace declaration, which is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration using pkg_resources, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
