  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it dynamically imports 'pkg_resources' via __import__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external communication; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard namespace declaration pattern, no obfuscation or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkg_resources' and calls declare_namespace(__name__), a common pattern for namespace packages. It involves no data handling, external communication, or malicious activity. The use of __import__ with a string argument is typical in setup or namespace declaration code. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward and standard pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its purpose and assign appropriate scores. No modifications are necessary.",
