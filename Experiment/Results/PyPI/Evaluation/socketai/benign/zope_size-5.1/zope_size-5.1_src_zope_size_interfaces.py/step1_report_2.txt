{
  "purpose": "Define an interface for objects that have a size in various units, including methods for retrieving size information for sorting and display.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'zope.interface' and the class/method definitions within the module.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or handle untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is purely interface declaration without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code strictly defines an interface with documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module from zope.interface to define an interface 'ISized' with two methods: sizeForSorting() and sizeForDisplay(). The interface is well-documented, specifying expected behavior and return types. No execution, data processing, or external calls are present. The code appears to be a standard interface definition with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward interface declaration used for size-related objects within a larger system. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks.",
