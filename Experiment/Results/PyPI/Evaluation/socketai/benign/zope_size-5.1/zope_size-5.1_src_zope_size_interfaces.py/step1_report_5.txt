  "purpose": "Define an interface for objects that can report their size in various units, with methods for sorting and display purposes.",
  "sources": "Import from zope.interface; class ISized and its methods sizeForSorting and sizeForDisplay.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data inputs or data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears standard for defining an interface with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known library 'zope.interface' and defines an interface 'ISized' with two methods. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious constructs. The methods are docstring-only and have no implementation, typical for an interface. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward interface definition for object sizing in the Zope framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
