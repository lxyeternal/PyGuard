{
  "purpose": "Define an interface 'ISized' with methods for obtaining size information and display representation of objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports 'zope.interface' for interface declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code is purely declarative with no data flow.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; methods are only documented signatures without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward interface declaration using zope.interface, defining two methods with descriptive docstrings. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or malicious constructs. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's purpose is purely declarative, typical for framework interfaces, and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign interface definition with no malicious activity or security issues. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
