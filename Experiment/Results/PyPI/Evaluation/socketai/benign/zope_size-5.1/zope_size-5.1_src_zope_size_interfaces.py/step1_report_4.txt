  "purpose": "Define an interface for objects that have a measurable size, with methods for sorting and displaying size information.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from zope.interface import Interface",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted input; methods are abstract and intended for implementation by other classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code adheres to standard interface definition practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known library, zope.interface, and defines an interface class ISized with two abstract methods. The class and methods are straightforward, serving as an abstract blueprint without any implementation or runtime behavior. No input handling, data manipulation, or external interactions are present. No obfuscated code, malicious patterns, or suspicious logic are detected. The code is purely declarative, typical of interface definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard interface declaration for a sizing object, with no malicious behavior or security issues. It does not contain any external data handling, malicious payloads, or suspicious constructs. Overall, it appears safe and purely structural.",
