  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation, primarily reading version info from a local file.",
  "sources": "Reading version string from '../version.txt'.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; only file read operation.",
  "flows": "File read from '../version.txt' to assign 'release' and 'version' variables.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script. It reads version info from a local file, sets up extensions, themes, and options for documentation. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data processing is present. The file read operation is typical for version management and does not pose security risks. The code structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk ~0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minimal external file read is standard practice and does not introduce security concerns.",
