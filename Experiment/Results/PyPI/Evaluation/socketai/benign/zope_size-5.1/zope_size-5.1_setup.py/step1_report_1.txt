{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the zope.size package, including dependencies, package metadata, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading version from 'version.txt', reading long description from 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is used in a manner that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Reading files (version.txt, README.rst, CHANGES.rst) to populate package metadata; no data flows into executable code paths that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. The code follows standard setup.py structure. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py configuration script for a Python package, importing standard modules (os, setuptools). It reads metadata files ('version.txt', 'README.rst', 'CHANGES.rst') and passes them to setuptools.setup(). No external inputs are processed insecurely. All dependencies are standard and well-known. No code injection, malicious data handling, or obfuscation is present. No network activity, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily reads static files and defines package metadata and dependencies.",
