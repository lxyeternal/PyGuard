{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the zope.size package, including dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'version.txt', 'README.rst', and 'CHANGES.rst' files, and imports standard modules and setup tools.",
  "sinks": "File reads (version and description files), package setup parameters; no untrusted data handling or external network communication.",
  "flows": "Reads static files to populate package metadata; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. It reads package metadata from local files and defines dependencies, classifiers, and package info. There are no dynamic code executions, no network communications, no obfuscation, and no evidence of malicious intent. The structure and contents are typical for open-source package setup scripts. All file reads are for static files, and no untrusted input sources or dangerous functions are used.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate and typical package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
