{
  "purpose": "The code sets up the package configuration for the 'zope.size' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading version.txt, README.rst, CHANGES.rst files; importing os, setuptools modules; reading package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or execution occurs at runtime beyond standard setup procedures.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> setting variables -> calling setup() with collected data; no external or untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard package setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs package metadata collection and configuration for setup.py. It reads static files for versioning and descriptions, and defines dependencies and classifiers. No code injection, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The dependencies are standard for package setup, and no runtime input handling or network activity is involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It strictly performs package configuration tasks with no indications of malware or malicious behavior.",
