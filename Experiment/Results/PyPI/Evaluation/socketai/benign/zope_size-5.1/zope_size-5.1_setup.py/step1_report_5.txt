  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'zope.size' Python package, including package metadata, dependencies, and distribution details.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'version.txt', 'README.rst', and 'CHANGES.rst'; static data definitions within the script.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external inputs are processed or executed in a dangerous manner.",
  "flows": "Reading files and static data definitions, which do not lead to any external or untrusted sink execution or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code is a typical setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs file reads for package metadata and defines package configuration via setuptools. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted input. The dependencies are standard and openly documented. The code structure follows typical setup.py conventions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads static files and defines package metadata and dependencies.",
