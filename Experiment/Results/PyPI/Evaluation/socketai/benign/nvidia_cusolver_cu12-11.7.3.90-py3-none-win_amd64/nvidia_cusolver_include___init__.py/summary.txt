  "conclusion": "Report 5's high scores are justified by its suspicious features, and other reports' low scores align with benign assessments. Minor calibration of risk scores in reports 2 and 4 improves consistency. The overall scoring accurately reflects the analyzed code features, with appropriate emphasis on the suspicious nature of report 5."
