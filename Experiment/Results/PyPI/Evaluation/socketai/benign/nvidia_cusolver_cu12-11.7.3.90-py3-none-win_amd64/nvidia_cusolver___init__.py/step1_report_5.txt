  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, function parameters, or external files (if any are present). No explicit data sources are identifiable without code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writes, or system commands if present. Without explicit code, no specific sink is identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment, files) to sinks (network, files, system). No explicit flow is evident without code content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are detected from the provided prompt. Lack of visible code prevents detailed anomaly detection.",
  "analysis": "Due to absence of the actual code snippet, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. The review is limited to the guidelines and the provided prompt, which contains no code. No malicious patterns or security issues are identifiable at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, there are no evident signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign or insufficient data is available to determine otherwise.",
