{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing, possibly related to user input or external data ingestion.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input functions or external data sources such as files or network connections.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, prints output, or sends data over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, possibly reaching output or storage sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or backdoors detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles data input and output with standard processing steps. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, system modification, or malicious network activity. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate. No unusual or suspicious code structures detected. The absence of dynamic code execution, obfuscated segments, or hidden behaviors suggests low likelihood of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It performs typical data handling operations without suspicious patterns or backdoors. The overall security risk is minimal.",
