  "conclusion": "The provided reports are generally accurate and internally consistent. Reports 1-3 correctly identify the absence of code and assign zero risk. Report 4's high malicious indicators justify its elevated scores. Report 5's obfuscation warrants a higher malware score than initially assigned, aligning with the suspicion of hidden malicious behavior. Overall, the assessments and scores are justified, with minor adjustments to report 5's malware score recommended for consistency."
