  "conclusion": "The script is benign, functioning as a typical setup utility. The only minor security consideration is the use of os.system() for version tagging, which is standard practice but should be replaced with subprocess for enhanced safety. Overall, no malicious activity or obfuscation is present, and the risk is minimal."
