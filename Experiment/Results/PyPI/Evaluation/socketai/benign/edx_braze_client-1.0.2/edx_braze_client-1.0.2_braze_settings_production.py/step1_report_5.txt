  "purpose": "Define production settings for the braze app by extending common plugin settings.",
  "sources": "Import from .common module; the 'settings' parameter passed into plugin_settings function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "The 'settings' parameter flows into common_plugin_settings(settings).",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a common settings module and defines a function to potentially override these settings in production. The function currently only calls the common settings without adding custom logic or sensitive data. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code structure is straightforward, serving as a configuration extension point. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple configuration stub for production settings, extending common settings without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and benign.",
