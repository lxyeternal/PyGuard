  "purpose": "Configuration wrapper for braze production settings, delegating to common plugin settings.",
  "sources": "The 'settings' parameter passed into plugin_settings function.",
  "sinks": "The call to common_plugin_settings(settings).",
  "flows": "The 'settings' parameter flows directly into common_plugin_settings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a common settings function and defines a wrapper that delegates to it. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, network activity, or data leaks. The code's purpose is purely configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The security risk is negligible, and malware score is zero. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports reflects cautiousness about future modifications but is not justified by current code. All signals indicate benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal configuration wrapper with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate. The minor security risk score of 0.1 can be lowered to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security concern.",
