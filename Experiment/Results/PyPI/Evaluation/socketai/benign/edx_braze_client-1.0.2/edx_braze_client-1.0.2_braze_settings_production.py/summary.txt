  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal configuration wrapper with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate. The minor security risk score of 0.1 can be lowered to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security concern."
