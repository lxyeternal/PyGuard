  "purpose": "Define production settings for the braze app, extending common plugin settings.",
  "sources": "Import from .common module, input parameter 'settings' in plugin_settings function.",
  "sinks": "The 'settings' object may be modified or used elsewhere; no direct untrusted data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "The function calls common_plugin_settings(settings), passing the settings object, which could modify or read it.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a common settings function and defines a wrapper for production settings without adding any custom logic. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident. The simplicity reduces the likelihood of hidden malicious intent. It appears to be a standard configuration extension without suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely delegates to a common settings function, serving as a placeholder for potential future customizations.",
