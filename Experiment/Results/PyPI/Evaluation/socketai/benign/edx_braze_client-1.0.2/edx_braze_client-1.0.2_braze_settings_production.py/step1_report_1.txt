  "purpose": "Configure production settings for a Braze application by extending common plugin settings.",
  "sources": "Import from the '.common' module and the 'settings' parameter passed to plugin_settings function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows identified; the code only calls a function with a parameter.",
  "flows": "The 'settings' parameter flows into 'common_plugin_settings(settings)'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a common settings function and defines a function to set production settings, currently just calling the common settings function without additional modifications. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code. The code is minimal and standard for configuration purposes. No external data, network activity, or secret handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple configuration wrapper that extends common plugin settings for production. There are no indications of malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign, intended part of a larger configuration setup.",
