  "purpose": "This code defines a function to apply production settings for a Braze app, based on common settings.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from an imported module (.common) and the 'settings' parameter passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "The 'settings' parameter, which could potentially be modified or used insecurely if malicious, but the code only passes it to another function.",
  "flows": "The function receives 'settings' as input, and calls 'common_plugin_settings(settings)', passing the same object along without modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a common settings module and defines a function to set production settings for an application. It simply calls a function from an imported module, passing the 'settings' object. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs, no external network activity, and no code obfuscation. The minimal structure and lack of hidden behavior suggest no malicious intent. The comments indicate a placeholder for future customizations but do not currently include any malicious or insecure code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and serves as a configuration setup without any malicious intent or security risks.",
