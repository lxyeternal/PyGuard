  "purpose": "Configure production settings for the Braze app by importing common settings and allowing for potential overrides.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'plugin_settings' from a local module 'common'. The 'settings' parameter in the function 'plugin_settings'.",
  "sinks": "The 'settings' parameter passed to 'common_plugin_settings' function; no other untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "The function takes 'settings' as input and passes it to 'common_plugin_settings', potentially modifying or configuring it.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code. The function is effectively a placeholder for future custom settings.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a shared configuration function 'common_plugin_settings' and defines a wrapper 'plugin_settings' for production settings. The implementation is minimal and serves as a template. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. The code is straightforward and only calls an imported function with provided parameters. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious network activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple placeholder for production configuration with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on external common settings and provides a structure for future customization.",
