  "purpose": "Configure devstack settings for the braze application by importing and invoking common plugin settings.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .common import plugin_settings as common_plugin_settings; Function parameter: settings",
  "sinks": "Invocation of common_plugin_settings(settings)",
  "flows": "The function plugin_settings calls common_plugin_settings with the provided settings object.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns. The code is simple and only involves import and function call.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function named plugin_settings from a local module named common, renames it as common_plugin_settings, and defines a function that calls this imported function with a settings argument. The function itself contains only comments and a straightforward function call without any data manipulation or security-sensitive operations. No obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious logic are present. The code appears to be a configuration placeholder with no suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration setup that imports and applies common plugin settings for the braze app. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
