  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the presence of malicious activity, the appropriateness of the scores, and any inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a simple configuration module that imports a function and calls it with a settings parameter.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external communications are present.\n- The code appears benign, serving as a placeholder or wrapper for common settings.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Benign, straightforward configuration code. No malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Fully consistent. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar benign configuration code. Slightly higher securityRisk (0.1), possibly reflecting minimal concern over the import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.0\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No malicious activity. The securityRisk is minimal and justified given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard configuration code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same benign pattern, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, with a slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small securityRisk (0.1).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Still consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All zero, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0 or 0.1), appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of security-sensitive operations.\n- **Confidence levels:** High (1 or 0.9), justified by the clear, benign nature of the code.\n\n### **Potential adjustments:**\n\n- The **securityRisk** scores are minimal and justified. No changes needed.\n- The **malware** and **obfuscated** scores are accurate.\n- The **confidence** scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n- The overall risk is negligible; the code is a benign configuration placeholder.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (reflecting minimal inherent risk in configuration code)  \n- **Confidence:** 1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's nature.",
