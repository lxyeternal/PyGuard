  "purpose": "Configure devstack settings for the braze application by importing and potentially overriding common plugin settings.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .common import plugin_settings as common_plugin_settings",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that act as sinks",
  "flows": "The function plugin_settings calls common_plugin_settings with the provided settings",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no hardcoded secrets, suspicious logic, or obfuscation; it appears to be straightforward configuration code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module and defines a wrapper function that calls this imported function. It contains only documentation comments and simple function calls without processing or handling untrusted input. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious data flow.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard configuration code for setting up devstack settings with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be a benign, routine setup module.",
