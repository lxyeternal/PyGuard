{
  "purpose": "Configuration wrapper for devstack settings related to the braze application.",
  "sources": "Import from local module '.common' and the 'settings' parameter passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "The code calls a function with 'settings' but does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "The 'plugin_settings' function receives 'settings' and passes it directly to 'common_plugin_settings' without modification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal configuration stub that imports a function and wraps it within another function. It contains only comments and straightforward function calls, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The slight securityRisk score of 0.1 in some reports is marginal; given the simplicity and lack of sensitive operations, it can be justified as 0. However, it does not impact the overall benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward configuration wrapper with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
