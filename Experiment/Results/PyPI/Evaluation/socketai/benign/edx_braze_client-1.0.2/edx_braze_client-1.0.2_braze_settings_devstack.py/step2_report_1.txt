  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe a very simple configuration module that imports a function (`plugin_settings`) from a local module (`.common`) and defines a wrapper function that calls this imported function with a `settings` parameter.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external data handling is evident.\n- The code appears to be a benign, routine configuration stub with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if Issues Are Present\n\n**Issue Presence:**  \nAll reports agree that the code is straightforward and benign. There are no indications of malicious code, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors. The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute any dynamic code.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No security issues are present in the code.**\n\n---\n\n### Flaws, Mistakes, or Logical Errors in the Reports\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify that the code is a simple configuration wrapper.\n- No flaws or logical errors are evident in the reasoning.\n\n**No issues here.**\n\n---\n\n### Scores Evaluation\n\n- **Confidence:** Mostly 1.0, indicating high confidence that the code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security Risk:** Mostly 0, with a few reports assigning 0.1, which is acceptable given the minimal nature of the code.\n\n**Suggestions:**  \n- The minor securityRisk scores (0.1) are reasonable, as the code could be seen as a placeholder that might be extended in the future, but currently poses no risk.\n- The malware scores are correctly 0, reflecting no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5\n\n- Since there is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerability, scores above 0.5 are unwarranted.\n- The code is a simple, benign configuration stub.\n\n**Therefore, I agree with the existing scores and would not recommend increasing them.**\n\n---\n\n### Malware Score Analysis\n\n- All reports correctly assign malware score as 0.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n**Confirmed:** malware score should remain 0.\n\n---\n\n### Claims Based on Assumptions\n\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n- All assessments are cautious and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of Scores with the Reports\n\n- Scores are consistent with the benign analysis.\n- No discrepancies are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation\n\n**Based on the analysis:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nThis code is a simple configuration wrapper with no security implications. The minimal risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Estimated Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | 0               |\n| Obfuscated         | 0               |\n| Security Risk      | 0               |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No changes needed.",
