{
  "purpose": "Configure devstack settings for the braze app, primarily by importing common settings.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'plugin_settings' from a module named '.common'. The function 'plugin_settings' takes 'settings' as input.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process or output untrusted data; it only modifies settings via a function call.",
  "flows": "The function 'plugin_settings' calls 'common_plugin_settings(settings)', passing the 'settings' object without any validation or modification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code; the code is straightforward. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function and defines a settings function that invokes the imported function with the provided settings object. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data leaks, and no security-sensitive operations. The code is minimal, intended for configuration purposes, and does not perform any malicious actions or contain hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple configuration stub that imports and applies common plugin settings for a dev environment. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks detected.",
