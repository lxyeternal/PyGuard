  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided summaries.",
  "sources": "High-level descriptions indicating data processing, network activity, module imports, and utility functions; no specific code snippets provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows involving environment variables, network communication, file operations, or subprocess calls, but no concrete code details available.",
  "flows": "Data from inputs or environment variables to sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions, inferred from descriptions but not explicitly shown.",
  "anomalies": "No concrete anomalies detected; mentions of hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, eval/exec are noted but not confirmed in code. No suspicious patterns or malicious payloads identified.",
  "analysis": "All reports are based on high-level summaries without actual code snippets. They consistently note the absence of concrete malicious indicators, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. Confidence levels range from 0.6 to 0.8, reflecting cautious but reasonable assessments. Malware scores are uniformly zero, aligning with the lack of evidence. Security risk scores are low (0.2-0.3), indicating minimal threat. The reasoning is coherent, and scores are consistent with descriptions. No significant issues or contradictions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided summaries and scores are consistent, justified, and indicate no malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The low security risk scores are appropriate given the limited information. No adjustments are necessary at this stage.",
