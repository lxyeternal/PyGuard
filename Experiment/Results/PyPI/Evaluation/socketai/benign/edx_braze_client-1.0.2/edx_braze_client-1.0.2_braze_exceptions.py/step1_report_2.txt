  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling Braze API errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and the __init__ method for BrazeRateLimitError.",
  "sinks": "Exception handling mechanisms that may process these errors.",
  "flows": "Creation of BrazeRateLimitError object with reset_epoch_s, propagating through exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exceptions inheriting from a base BrazeError class, which itself inherits from Exception. The BrazeRateLimitError includes an init method accepting a reset_epoch_s parameter, representing a Unix timestamp, and stores it as an instance attribute. No input/output operations, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The code appears to serve as a structured way to handle API errors related to Braze. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and functional for its intended purpose.",
