  "review": "Let's analyze each report and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only defines custom exception classes for handling Braze API errors.\n   - No external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - The classes are straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious logic.\n   - The BrazeRateLimitError class stores a reset timestamp, which is standard practice.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural and serves as an error handling framework.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident; the reasoning aligns with standard Python exception class definitions.\n   - The reports consistently note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - No evidence of malicious code, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The code is purely structural, defining exception classes.\n   - Therefore, higher risk scores are unjustified; the assigned scores of 0 are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - No malicious behavior or code is present.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the purpose and behavior of the code.\n   - The inclusion of a timestamp in BrazeRateLimitError is standard for rate limiting, not suspicious.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements are present.\n- The scores and reasoning are appropriate and well-justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code is a benign, standard pattern for error handling in API integrations. The reports are accurate, and the scores reflect the actual risk level.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe.\n- No changes needed in scoring.\n- The analysis aligns with best practices for security review.",
