  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports consistently state that the code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling Braze API errors.\n- They emphasize that the code is straightforward, with no suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code.\n- The only dynamic element is the `BrazeRateLimitError`, which accepts a `reset_epoch_s` timestamp, a common pattern for rate-limiting handling.\n- No external data, input/output, network activity, or data leaks are involved.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which aligns with their analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if Issues Are Present\n- The code matches the description: it's purely class definitions with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are evident in the code.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report\n- The reports are accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- No logical errors or flaws are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n### Scores and Their Reasonableness\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate; there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified, given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- The risk score, based on the reports, remains at 0, which is reasonable.\n\n### Justification for Higher Risk Scores\n- Since all reports agree on the benign nature, there's no need to justify higher risk scores.\n- The only potential concern could be if the `reset_epoch_s` were used maliciously, but as it is just stored as an attribute, it doesn't pose a risk.\n\n### Challenging Assumptions\n- The assumption that this code is purely structural and safe is well-supported.\n- No hidden behaviors or malicious intent are suggested or implied.\n\n### Consistency of Scores\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of exception classes.  \n- No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present.  \n- The only dynamic attribute, `reset_epoch_s`, is used in a typical manner for rate-limiting, not malicious purposes.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is safe, benign, and serves a clear purpose in error handling for the Braze API. No further action or concern is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exceptions.  \n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity are detected.  \n- Scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk.",
