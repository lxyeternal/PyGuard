  "purpose": "Define exception classes related to Braze API errors for handling different HTTP error responses.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external data or input.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "None; there are no source-to-sink data flows, as this is purely class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The class hierarchy and constructor are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for handling API errors. Each class inherits from the base Exception class or from a parent custom error class. The BrazeRateLimitError includes a timestamp argument indicating when the rate limit resets, which is a typical pattern for rate-limiting handling. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior. The classes are purely structural and do not perform any operations beyond inheritance and storing an optional attribute.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling. It contains no malicious intent, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It serves as part of an error management framework.",
