  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes related to Braze API errors.\n- The classes are straightforward, inheriting from Exception or a custom base.\n- The BrazeRateLimitError class includes an init method accepting a reset_epoch_s timestamp, stored as an attribute.\n- No external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, secrets, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, all reports agree that the code is purely structural, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning flaws?**  \n  None. The code correctly models API error classes, with appropriate inheritance and a sensible attribute for rate limiting.\n\n- **Any inaccuracies?**  \n  No. The reports accurately describe the code's purpose and structure.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All assign 0, which is justified as there are no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0 or 0.5, with the latter not specified here. Given the nature of the code, a score of 0 is appropriate. There are no security implications.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The only dynamic aspect is the `reset_epoch_s` attribute in `BrazeRateLimitError`, which is a timestamp indicating when the rate limit resets. This is standard and not malicious.\n- No external input handling, no data leaks, no obfuscation, no code execution.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exceptions for API error handling.\n- No suspicious or malicious activity is present.\n- The scores assigned in all reports are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0**  \n\nThe code is benign, purely structural, and serves as part of an error handling framework.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and thorough. The code is safe, with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores reflect this appropriately.",
