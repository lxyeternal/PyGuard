  "purpose": "Define exception classes related to Braze API errors for error handling.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; class definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes serve as exception types.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception class definitions for handling various Braze API errors. Each class inherits from a base exception, with specific subclasses representing different HTTP error statuses or error conditions. The BrazeRateLimitError class includes a constructor that sets a reset timestamp, which is standard for rate limit handling. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no code execution or obfuscated elements. No potential security risks or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward class definitions for error handling without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It functions solely to categorize exceptions for the Braze API integration.",
