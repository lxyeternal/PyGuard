  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling Braze API errors.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; class definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard exception class definitions without suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception class, used for error handling related to Braze API interactions. The classes are straightforward, with one class, BrazeRateLimitError, including an init method that accepts a reset_epoch_s parameter to indicate when the API can be retried. No input/output operations, network calls, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be clean, simple, and solely focused on defining error types.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
