  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling related to the Braze API.\n   - No dynamic code, data processing, network calls, or external input handling are present.\n   - The classes are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or hidden logic.\n   - The only notable attribute is `reset_epoch_s` in `BrazeRateLimitError`, which is a timestamp indicating when rate limits reset—this is standard practice.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and safe.\n   - No errors or flawed reasoning are evident in the analysis.\n   - The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity and purpose.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n     - Confidence: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely structural, defining exception classes without any operational logic, there is no justification for high risk scores.\n   - The risk score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - No malicious activity is present or implied.\n   - The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling. There are no security concerns, malicious intent, or obfuscation.**",
