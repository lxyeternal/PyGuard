  "flows": "Creating specific error instances, particularly BrazeRateLimitError with reset_epoch_s passed during initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or malicious behavior observed. No external data input handling or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes to represent various errors that might occur when interacting with the Braze API. The only dynamic aspect is the BrazeRateLimitError class, which accepts a reset_epoch_s parameter, indicating when the API rate limit resets. This parameter is stored as an attribute but is not used in any malicious or suspicious manner. The class structure and naming are straightforward and align with standard Python exception handling practices. There are no signs of obfuscated code, data leaks, or malicious actions. The code solely focuses on defining error classes without any runtime logic, data handling, or external communications.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of standard exception class definitions for API error handling, with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It is a typical, safe implementation for managing API errors in a Python application.",
