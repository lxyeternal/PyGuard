  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes for handling Braze API errors.\n   - All classes inherit appropriately, and the BrazeRateLimitError includes a timestamp attribute for rate-limiting logic.\n   - No dynamic code, external input, or data processing is present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is purely structural, with no malicious intent.\n   - They note the absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or external data handling.\n   - The analysis and conclusions are consistent and accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are high (1), reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable given the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements, a risk score above 0.5 is unwarranted.\n   - The current scores of 0 or 1 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static analysis of class definitions.\n   - The code does not perform any runtime operations that could be malicious.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious or obfuscated behavior exists.\n- The scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and serves its purpose without introducing any security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the true risk profile.",
