  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling Braze API errors.",
  "sources": "No external data, input, or dynamic code; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow, external input, or output involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; classes are static definitions with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class hierarchy with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception, modeling various API error types. The only dynamic element is the reset_epoch_s attribute in BrazeRateLimitError, which stores a timestamp for rate limiting. No external data, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The code is clear, standard, and serves as an error handling framework. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes for API error handling. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The assigned scores are justified and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
