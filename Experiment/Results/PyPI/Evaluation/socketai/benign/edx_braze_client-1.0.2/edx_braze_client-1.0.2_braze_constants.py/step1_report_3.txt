{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and endpoint URLs for the Braze client API integration.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines static constants and configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows present; the code is purely declarative and does not process input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists solely of constant definitions and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code provides static endpoint URLs, request types, size limits, and other constants related to the Braze API. It is purely configuration, with no dynamic data handling, external inputs, or executable logic that could lead to malicious activity. There are no hardcoded credentials, no code injection points, and no suspicious behavior. It adheres to standard practices for defining API constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely declarative, and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as configuration metadata for a Braze client module.",
