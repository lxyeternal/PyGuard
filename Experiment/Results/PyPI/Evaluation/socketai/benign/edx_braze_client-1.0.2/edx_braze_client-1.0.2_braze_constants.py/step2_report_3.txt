  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is purely declarative, defining constants, API endpoints, request types, size limits, and status strings.\n- No functions, data processing, input handling, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are included.\n- The code does not handle untrusted data, perform network requests, or contain any executable logic that could be exploited.\n- The documentation and naming are clear and aligned with the intended API usage.\n\n**Assessment of malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. No malicious behavior, payloads, or suspicious activity are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation techniques.\n- **Security risk score:** 0. The code is a configuration module with no vulnerabilities or attack vectors.\n\n**Potential issues or points of concern:**\n- The code is static and simple; it doesn't process untrusted input or perform network operations.\n- The constants are well-documented and align with external API documentation.\n- There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation.\n\n**Scores consistency and justification:**\n- All reports assign scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and 0 or 1 for confidence.\n- Given the code's nature, these scores are appropriate.\n- The high confidence (1) reflects the straightforward, static nature of the code.\n\n**Any discrepancies or suggestions:**\n- The scores seem consistent and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Summary and personal estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign configuration module with no security concerns. It is typical for API client setup and poses no threat.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nAll reports correctly identify the code as safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scoring aligns with the code's content and behavior.",
