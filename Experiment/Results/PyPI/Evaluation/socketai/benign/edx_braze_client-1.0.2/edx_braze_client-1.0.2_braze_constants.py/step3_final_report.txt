{
  "purpose": "Defines constants, API endpoints, request types, size limits, and status strings for the Braze client configuration.",
  "sources": "Class attributes and module-level constants; no input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external outputs; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static constants; no data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration with clear documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions and constants setting API endpoints, request types, size limits, and status strings. There are no functions, data processing, input handling, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is purely declarative, serving as configuration data for the Braze API client. Given the absence of executable logic, data flows, or external interactions, there are no security vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, obfuscation techniques, or attack vectors. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the code's static and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration module defining API endpoints and related constants for the Braze client. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign, declarative nature, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or modifications are necessary.",
