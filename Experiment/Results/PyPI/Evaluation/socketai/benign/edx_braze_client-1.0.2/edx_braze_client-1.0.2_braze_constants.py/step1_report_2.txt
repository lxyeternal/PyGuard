  "purpose": "Define constants and endpoints related to the Braze API for sending campaigns, tracking users, and managing unsubscribes.",
  "sources": "Constants for API endpoints and configuration parameters, no external input reading present.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data processing with untrusted input; this code only defines static values.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; purely static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and only contains constants and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions and constants that specify API endpoints, request types, and configuration limits for the Braze client. There are no functions, data handling, or input/output operations that could lead to vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The constants are appropriately named and documented. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. The code appears to serve as a configuration module for an application interfacing with the Braze API.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple configuration setup for the Braze client, with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It does not process untrusted data or contain harmful behaviors.",
