  "purpose": "Define constants and endpoints for interacting with the Braze API, including request types, data limits, and status strings.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions for API endpoints, request types, chunk sizes, and status values.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "The code mainly establishes static constants; there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines static constants for API endpoints and configuration parameters. It does not process, handle, or manipulate untrusted data. No input/output or dynamic code execution is present. The absence of data handling, cryptographic operations, or network activity indicates a straightforward configuration module. There are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of constant definitions for the Braze API, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign configuration module.",
