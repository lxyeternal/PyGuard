{
  "purpose": "Defines constants and endpoints related to the Braze API for user engagement and data export.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data leads to vulnerabilities; the code only defines static constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, defining static API endpoints and configuration constants.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only class and constant definitions for API endpoints, request types, chunk sizes, and limits. There are no functions, data processing, input handling, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The structure and content suggest configuration for API interactions without any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple configuration module containing API endpoint constants and limits. It poses no security risks, malware, or obfuscation concerns. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
