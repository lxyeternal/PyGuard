  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is purely static configuration/constants for the Braze API.\n- No functions, data processing, input handling, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malware, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** No issues; code is straightforward, defining constants.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct. The code is safe and benign.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; constants and endpoints, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Static constants, no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Pure configuration, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; static constants, no processing.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code:** No. All reports correctly identify that the code is static configuration with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores assigned:** All are zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Risk justification:** Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present, the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment and recommendations:**\n\n**1. Malware score:**  \n- Confirmed as 0. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**2. Obfuscated score:**  \n- Confirmed as 0. No obfuscation present.\n\n**3. Security risk score:**  \n- Confirmed as 0. No vulnerabilities or security issues.\n\n**4. Additional considerations:**  \n- The code appears to be a standard configuration module for API endpoints and constants.\n- No changes needed; the reports are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a static, well-documented constants module with no signs of malicious or obfuscated code, nor any security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that such configuration files are kept free of secrets or sensitive data, but in this case, no such data is present. The code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
