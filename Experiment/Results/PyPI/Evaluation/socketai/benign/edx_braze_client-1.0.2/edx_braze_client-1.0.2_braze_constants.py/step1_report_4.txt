  "purpose": "Define constants and API endpoint paths for the Braze client integration.",
  "sources": "Constant assignments and class attributes, no external data input or data reading sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data outputs, network requests, or external data handling evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely static constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static class attributes and constants defining API endpoints, request types, chunk sizes, and other configuration parameters. It appears to serve as a configuration or constants module for the Braze client. There are no signs of malicious logic, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The constants seem appropriately named and aligned with API documentation references. No external data input, environment variable usage, or network activity is present within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward constants definition module for the Braze API client. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears safe and typical for configuration purposes.",
