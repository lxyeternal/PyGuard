  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Content of the Original Code:**\n   - The code is a standard Django application configuration for a \"braze\" app.\n   - It sets up plugin settings for different environments (`common`, `production`, `devstack`) for both `lms.djangoapp` and `cms.djangoapp`.\n   - The code appears straightforward, with no obvious security issues, dynamic code execution, or insecure configurations.\n\n2. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All reports are empty (\"Empty response\") and contain no detailed information.\n   - Without specific details, errors, or concerns raised in these reports, it's impossible to identify actual vulnerabilities, flaws, or malicious activity.\n\n3. **Logical Evaluation:**\n   - Since the reports lack content, there are no claims or assumptions to challenge.\n   - No indication of malicious behavior, insecure practices, or code flaws is present.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - Given the absence of concrete issues, any risk or malware scores should be minimal or zero.\n   - The code itself does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behavior.\n   - Without additional context or detailed reports, assigning higher scores would be unwarranted.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns (Hypothetical):**\n   - If the reports were to mention that environment settings are improperly configured or sensitive data is exposed, that could raise risk scores.\n   - If there were claims of malicious code or malware, that would influence the malware score.\n   - However, since reports are empty, such concerns are unsubstantiated.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Code appears clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No identified vulnerabilities or security issues.\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the provided code and the empty reports, there are no apparent security issues or malicious behaviors. The scores should reflect this, with all being at the lowest levels.\n\n**Note:** Always recommend obtaining detailed reports for thorough security analysis.",
