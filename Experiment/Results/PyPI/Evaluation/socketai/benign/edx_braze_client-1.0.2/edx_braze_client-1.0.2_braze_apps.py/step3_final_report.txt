  "purpose": "Configure the 'braze' Django application with environment-specific plugin settings for 'lms.djangoapp' and 'cms.djangoapp'.",
  "sources": "Static code defining plugin settings and environment configuration paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data handling present; configuration paths are static.",
  "flows": "Configuration references environment-specific settings files; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and static with no dynamic execution or obfuscated segments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django AppConfig class setting up plugin environment paths. It does not process user input, fetch external data, or execute dynamic code. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The configuration is static and appears secure, assuming the referenced files are properly secured. The reports are empty, providing no additional context or concerns. Therefore, the code is benign, with no security issues or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django configuration module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The empty reports do not suggest any issues. All scores should be set to zero, indicating no malicious intent or security risk.",
