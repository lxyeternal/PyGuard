  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Context**:\n   - The code appears to be a Django settings module, primarily for testing purposes.\n   - It uses a local SQLite database, which is typical for test environments.\n   - It includes some hardcoded API keys and URLs, notably:\n     - `SECRET_KEY` set to `'fake-secret-key'`\n     - `EDX_BRAZE_API_KEY` set to `'test_braze_key'`\n     - `EDX_BRAZE_API_SERVER` set to `'https://braze.com'`\n     - `BRAZE_COURSE_ENROLLMENT_CANVAS_ID` set to `'test_canvas_id'`\n\n2. **Security Concerns in the Code**:\n   - **Hardcoded Secrets**: The presence of `SECRET_KEY` and API keys in code is a security risk if this code were to be used in production or shared publicly.\n   - **Testing Environment**: The comments indicate these are for testing, which mitigates some risk, but if accidentally deployed, it could be problematic.\n   - **No Obfuscation or Encryption**: Secrets are plainly visible, which is a concern if the code leaks.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:\n   - All reports indicate `\"error\": \"Empty response\"` with no raw response data.\n   - The reports are numbered 1 through 5, but contain no details about the nature of the issues.\n   - The absence of detailed responses makes it impossible to determine if there are actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n4. **Assessment of the Reports and Their Validity**:\n   - Since the reports contain no raw response data, they do not provide concrete evidence of issues.\n   - The \"Empty response\" message could mean:\n     - No actual vulnerability was detected.\n     - The scanner or tool used failed to retrieve or analyze the response properly.\n   - Without additional context or raw response data, these reports are inconclusive.\n\n5. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: Given the lack of evidence, the malware score should be low or zero unless there's explicit malicious code, which there isn't.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: No obfuscation is present; the code is straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score**: The presence of hardcoded secrets in a testing environment is a concern, but if this is strictly for testing and not deployed, the risk is minimal. However, if this code were to be accidentally used in production, the risk would be high.\n\n6. **Overall Recommendations**:\n   - **For the code**:\n     - Remove or secure secrets before deployment.\n     - Use environment variables or secure storage for secrets.\n   - **For the reports**:\n     - Request raw response data or more detailed findings to accurately assess vulnerabilities.\n     - Currently, the reports do not justify high scores due to lack of evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score**: **0.0** (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score**: **0.0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score**: **0.2** (low, because secrets are exposed but only in a testing context)\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are inconclusive due to lack of detailed data. The code contains insecure hardcoded secrets, which should be addressed, but there's no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The risk is minimal if this is strictly for testing.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: Always ensure secrets are managed securely and avoid hardcoding sensitive data, even in test environments.",
