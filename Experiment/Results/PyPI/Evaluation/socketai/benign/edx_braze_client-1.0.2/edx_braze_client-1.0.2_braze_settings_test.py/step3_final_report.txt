{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a Django testing configuration with dummy secrets and a local SQLite database, intended for development or testing environments.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment and configuration data such as SECRET_KEY, API keys, database settings, and installed apps.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded secrets ('fake-secret-key', 'test_braze_key') in a testing context; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The reports provided are all 'Empty response' with no additional details, indicating either incomplete data or non-relevant reports. The hardcoded secrets are acceptable in a testing environment but should be secured before production. No network activity, code injection, or suspicious logic is present. The absence of detailed responses prevents further analysis, but based on available information, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing, with no malicious activity or vulnerabilities detected. The reports lack substantive information, and the scores should reflect the absence of malware, obfuscation, and minimal risk.",
