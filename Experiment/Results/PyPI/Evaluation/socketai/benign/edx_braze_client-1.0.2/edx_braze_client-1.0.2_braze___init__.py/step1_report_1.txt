  "purpose": "Python client for interacting with Braze APIs.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; relies on external API calls and parameters.",
  "sinks": "API requests to Braze endpoints, possibly transmitting data over the network.",
  "flows": "Data may flow from function inputs to API requests, but no explicit code provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, and the code appears to be a simple client stub.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, containing only a version string and a brief description. No code that reads input, performs operations, or communicates with external systems is present. Without additional implementation details, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The structure is standard for a package's initial comment and version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be a benign module header or placeholder for a Braze API client.",
