  "purpose": "Minimal header indicating a Python client for Braze APIs, serving as a placeholder or documentation stub.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only a docstring and a version string with no data input, output, or external interactions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows, network calls, or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "None; no source-to-sink data flows exist in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module header with a docstring and a version string. No executable code, data handling, or network activity is present. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or security issues. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is negligible. The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident. The code appears to be a placeholder or documentation stub, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate; the malware and obfuscated scores should remain 0, and the security risk score can be confidently set to 0. No further action is necessary.",
