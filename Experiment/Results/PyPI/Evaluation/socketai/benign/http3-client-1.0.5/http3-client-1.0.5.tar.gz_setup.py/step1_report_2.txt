  "purpose": "Manage package versioning by reading and updating a local version file during setup",
  "sources": "Reading from 'version' file; writing to 'version' file",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or system modifications beyond version increment",
  "flows": "Read 'version' -> increment and write back -> use for package versioning",
  "anomalies": "Use of bare except clause, assuming 'version' file exists; no security issue but poor error handling; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to read a version number from a file named 'version'. If the file does not exist or an error occurs, it defaults to version 1. Then, it writes back an incremented version number to the same file. This process is used solely to keep track of package versioning. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or malicious code. The code structure is straightforward, with minimal security concerns. The only notable issue is the broad except clause, which could suppress important errors but does not introduce security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple version management without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscation, and its security risk level is very low.",
