  "purpose": "Manage versioning for the package by reading, incrementing, and writing a version number stored in a local file.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'version' file, writing to 'version' file",
  "sinks": "File I/O operations, package setup configuration",
  "flows": "Read 'version' -> increment -> write back 'version' -> use in setup()",
  "anomalies": "Broad exception handling with 'except:', no validation of file content, silent error handling",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple local file I/O to manage a version number for packaging. It reads the version, defaults to 1 if an error occurs, increments it, and writes it back. No network activity, user input, or external data sources are involved. The broad 'except:' clause silently catches all errors, which is a potential flaw but not malicious. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature. The main concern is error concealment due to broad exception handling, but this does not constitute a security vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign version management script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate, with a very low security risk score (~0.1) reflecting minor operational issues rather than security concerns.",
