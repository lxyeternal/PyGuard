  "purpose": "To manage package setup, read and update version number from a file, and define package requirements.",
  "sources": "Reading from the 'version' file; writing to the 'version' file.",
  "sinks": "The code writes to the 'version' file, potentially overwriting or corrupting version data.",
  "flows": "Reads 'version' -> increments version -> writes back to 'version' -> used in setup version string.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a broad except clause without specifying exception type, which can mask errors. No validation or sanitization of version number read from file. The code reads and writes a file named 'version' in the current directory, which is not inherently suspicious but could be misused in some contexts.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a version number from a file called 'version'. If the read fails (e.g., file missing or unreadable), it defaults to version 1. Then, it updates the 'version' file by writing the incremented version number. The setup() function defines the package name and version, incorporating the dynamic version. There is no network activity, no input from untrusted sources beyond file IO, and no malicious commands executed. The broad exception handling could conceal errors but does not introduce malicious behavior. The code is primarily for version management, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version management snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply reads, increments, and writes a version number for package setup purposes.",
