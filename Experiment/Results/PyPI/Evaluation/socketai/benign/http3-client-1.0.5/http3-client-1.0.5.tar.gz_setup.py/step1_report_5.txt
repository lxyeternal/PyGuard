  "purpose": "Manage package setup and versioning for the 'http3_client' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reading from and writing to the 'version' file on disk.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; only file operations and package setup configuration.",
  "flows": "Read version from file -> Increment version -> Write back to file -> Use version in package setup.",
  "anomalies": "Uses a broad except clause without specifying exception type, which could hide errors. Reads and writes to a local 'version' file without validation. No external data sources or network activity. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to read a version number from a local file named 'version'. If the file does not exist or an error occurs, it defaults to version 1. due to a broad except clause. It then increments the version and writes it back to the same file. This approach ensures a monotonically increasing version number with each execution. The setup() function is used to define package metadata, with the version dynamically generated. There are no external inputs, network calls, or suspicious behaviors. The code does not contain obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code manages package versioning in a straightforward manner without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The broad exception handling could potentially hide errors but does not introduce security risks. Overall, the script appears safe with no indications of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
