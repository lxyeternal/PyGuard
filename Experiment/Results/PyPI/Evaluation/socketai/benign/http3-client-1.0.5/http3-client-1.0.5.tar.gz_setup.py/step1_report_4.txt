  "purpose": "Manage package versioning by reading and updating a version number stored in a file during setup.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'version' file; writing to 'version' file.",
  "sinks": "Writing to 'version' file; no other data sinks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Read 'version' file -> increment version -> write back to 'version' file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a broad except clause that suppresses errors; simple version increment logic; no input validation; no malicious code or data manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to read a version number from a file named 'version' and increments it for the next package release. The except block catches all exceptions, defaulting the version to 1 if reading fails. The process involves straightforward file I/O without any network activity or cryptographic operations. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns. The version management appears standard for automated build processes, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version management routine for a Python package setup, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The broad exception handling is a minor concern but not malicious.",
