{
  "purpose": "Provide a set of classes and functions for unit conversions related to physical constants, energy, length, force, and pressure units.",
  "sources": "Constants defined in 'physical_constants'; functions 'scipy_constant_value', 'check_unit'; class initializers and methods setting conversion factors.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no untrusted data input or output handling observed.",
  "flows": "Constants are used in class initializations to set conversion factors; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation present. The code is straightforward unit conversion logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines physical constants and conversion classes with methods to check unit validity and perform conversions between various units. It does not perform external data input/output, network operations, or system modifications. No signs of malicious behavior or malware are present. The code is well-structured and uses standard Python features for unit conversions, with no anomalies or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign implementation of unit conversion classes for physical constants and units. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
