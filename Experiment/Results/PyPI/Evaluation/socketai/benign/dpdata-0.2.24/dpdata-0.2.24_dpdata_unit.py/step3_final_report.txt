{
  "purpose": "A scientific utility library providing constants and unit conversions for energy, length, force, and pressure based on physical constants.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded constants within dictionaries and class initializations; no external data sources or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs, external data inputs, or network interactions; purely computational.",
  "flows": "Constants are used directly in class calculations to set conversion values; no external data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in exception message ('Invaild' instead of 'Invalid') and assumption of specific unit string formats in pressure conversions; no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured implementation of physical constants and unit conversions. It performs validation on units, uses constants from scientific literature, and calculates conversion factors without external dependencies or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, network activity, or malicious code is present. The minor typo does not impact functionality. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, transparent utility library for scientific unit conversions. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
