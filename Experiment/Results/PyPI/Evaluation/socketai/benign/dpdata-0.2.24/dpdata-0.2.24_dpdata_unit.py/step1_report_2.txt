{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit conversion utilities for physical constants, energy, length, force, and pressure units, likely for scientific computations.",
  "sources": "Reads unit identifiers from function parameters and internal constants for physical constants.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points that handle untrusted data or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input units are validated and used to determine conversion factors; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause harm.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are observed. The code relies solely on predefined constants and straightforward calculations. No obfuscated code, dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of physical constants and conversion classes for energy, length, force, and pressure units. It performs unit validation, conversions, and checks for valid units. All functions and classes serve transparent, well-documented purposes related to unit conversions. There are no network operations, data leaks, or malicious code snippets. The functions rely on internal constants and straightforward calculations, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of unit conversion utilities for scientific applications. There is no evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. It is safe and purpose-driven, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
