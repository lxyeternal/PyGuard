{
  "purpose": "This code provides unit conversion utilities for physical constants, energy, length, force, and pressure units, primarily for scientific calculations involving physical constants and units.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded dictionaries for physical constants and unit conversion factors. It also reads input values via method calls such as set_value().",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly write to external systems, send data over networks, or access sensitive information. No untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input values are set via set_value(), and conversion factors are retrieved from dictionaries. There are no flows involving untrusted external input sources that could lead to code injection or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present. The code uses standard Python features for scientific calculations. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic are detected. The use of try-except for unit parsing is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of scientific unit conversions with defined constants and conversion factors. It performs unit validation, conversion calculations, and provides clear class structures for different physical quantities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration. All constants are hardcoded and do not depend on external inputs beyond function parameters, which are validated. No suspicious network activity or credential handling is present. The code appears to be a utility module designed for scientific computations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard scientific unit conversion library with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any network communication, data leaks, or suspicious operations. The overall security risk is minimal.",
