{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions for physical unit conversions related to energy, length, force, and pressure in scientific computations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or untrusted input sources are used; all data is hardcoded constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; the code only performs internal calculations and conversions.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve setting and computing conversion factors between units but do not process untrusted input data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, or hidden behaviors detected. The code relies on standard scientific constants and straightforward calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines physical constants, provides functions for unit validation, and classes for various unit conversions. It uses hardcoded constants, typical for scientific libraries. No external input is processed, and no network, file, or environment variable access is present. The code appears to be a clean, self-contained unit conversion library with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard scientific unit conversion library with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It only performs internal calculations based on predefined constants, suitable for scientific computations.",
