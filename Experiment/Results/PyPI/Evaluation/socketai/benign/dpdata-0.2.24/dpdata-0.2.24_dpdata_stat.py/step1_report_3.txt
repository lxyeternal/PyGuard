{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for calculating error metrics (MAE and RMSE) between two systems, specifically for systems of type LabeledSystem and MultiSystems. It appears to be part of a statistical analysis or validation framework.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from attributes of system_1 and system_2 objects, specifically 'energies' and 'forces' properties of these objects.",
  "sinks": "Computed errors are stored in numpy arrays; no direct data leaks or external data transmissions are evident. No untrusted input handling or external output operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (energies and forces) flows from system objects to error computations through properties, leading to calculations of error metrics like MAE and RMSE.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious external calls, or obfuscated code. The code uses standard libraries and patterns without unusual language features or misleading variable names. No hidden backdoors or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured way to compute error metrics between two systems, with the use of properties and caching for efficiency. It asserts the type of systems being compared, which adds safety but also indicates expected data structures. No network operations, file manipulations, or suspicious behavior is present. It primarily performs calculations on attributes of provided objects. There is no indication of malicious intent or data exfiltration. The functions and classes follow standard patterns for data analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard statistical utility for error analysis between system representations. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
