  "purpose": "Calculate error metrics (MAE and RMSE) between two systems or multisystems based on energies and forces attributes.",
  "sources": "Attributes 'energies' and 'forces' from system objects (LabeledSystem or MultiSystems).",
  "sinks": "In-memory data processing; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system attributes to error calculations within class properties.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility classes for error metrics, with assertions ensuring correct object types, and uses standard numpy functions. It performs straightforward calculations on object attributes, with caching for efficiency. No external I/O, network, or file operations are present. The code is clear, well-structured, and typical for scientific error analysis modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for error calculation with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scoring in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) is appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
