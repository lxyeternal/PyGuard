  "purpose": "Define classes and functions to compute errors (MAE and RMSE) between two systems or sets of systems, specifically LabeledSystem and MultiSystems.",
  "sources": "Imports (np, LabeledSystem, MultiSystems), class constructors, property methods (e_errors, f_errors), and functions mae, rmse.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code performs calculations on data provided by input system objects.",
  "flows": "Input system data (energies, forces) -> Error computations (e_errors, f_errors) -> Error metrics (MAE, RMSE).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code appears standard for error calculation purposes. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for MAE and RMSE, along with abstract and concrete classes for error calculation between systems. It uses assertions to verify input types, and caches computed errors with lru_cache for efficiency. It relies on data from system objects which are expected to contain energies and forces. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The imports are typical for numerical and data handling tasks, and no external network or system modification code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of error metrics for comparing systems, with no indicators of malicious activity or security risks. It strictly operates on provided data objects and performs straightforward calculations.",
