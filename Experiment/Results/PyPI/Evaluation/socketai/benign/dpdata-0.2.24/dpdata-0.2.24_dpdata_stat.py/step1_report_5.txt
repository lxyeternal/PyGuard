{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions to compute statistical errors (MAE, RMSE) between two systems or sets of systems, specifically for energy and force comparisons.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the attributes of the provided system objects: system_1 and system_2, specifically 'energies' and 'forces'. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are evident.",
  "sinks": "Computed error arrays are used internally for statistical calculations. There are no apparent sinks that write data to external systems, files, or networks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system object attributes ('energies', 'forces') into error calculations, which are then used for statistical functions (mae, rmse). The flow remains internal within object properties.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard Python libraries and common design patterns. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements error metrics between two data systems. It uses assertions to verify object types and properties to retrieve data, then computes errors with numpy functions. The use of @lru_cache indicates caching for performance optimization. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears standard and clean, with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of statistical error calculations for energy and force comparisons between systems. No malicious or security-threatening elements are present. It functions as a utility module for error analysis without external data sources or network interactions.",
