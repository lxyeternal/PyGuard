{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for calculating error metrics (MAE, RMSE) between two systems or sets of systems, primarily used for error analysis in machine learning or computational models related to energies and forces.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from properties of system objects (`energies` and `forces`) passed as arguments to class instances, particularly from `LabeledSystem` and `MultiSystems` objects.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks such as network communications, file operations, or execution of untrusted input. The code performs in-memory calculations and assertions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the `system_1` and `system_2` objects' properties (`energies` and `forces`) into error calculations through class methods and properties.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The code uses standard Python features, well-structured class hierarchies, and common mathematical operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed for error analysis between computational systems, with functions for calculating MAE and RMSE. The classes `Errors`, `MultiErrors`, and `ErrorsBase` handle the calculation of energy and force errors, utilizing properties and caching for efficiency. The code relies on standard Python libraries (`numpy`) and expected system objects (`LabeledSystem`, `MultiSystems`) that provide energy and force data. No network, file, or external process interactions are present. No code appears malicious or suspicious; it performs typical scientific computing tasks. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for calculating error metrics between computational models or datasets related to energies and forces. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
