{
  "purpose": "Provides a command line interface for manipulating atomic simulation data files with various format conversions.",
  "sources": "User input from command line arguments, specifically 'from_file', '--to_file', and other CLI options.",
  "sinks": "File reading/writing operations, printing output to console.",
  "flows": "Command line inputs are parsed and used to instantiate system objects; data is then converted and written or printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. No suspicious network calls, backdoors, or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a CLI wrapper around data conversion classes (LabeledSystem, MultiSystems, System). It reads user input, instantiates appropriate classes, and performs data conversions. There are no suspicious or malicious functions such as network access, file encryption, or exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be a straightforward interface with no hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI tool for data format conversion with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any suspicious or malicious code segments. The overall security risk is low.",
