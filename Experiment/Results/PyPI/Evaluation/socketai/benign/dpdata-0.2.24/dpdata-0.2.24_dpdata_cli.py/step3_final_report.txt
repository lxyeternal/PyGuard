  "purpose": "CLI utility for data format conversion using external classes.",
  "sources": "User input arguments, file reading via from_file, class methods (from_file, to).",
  "sinks": "Output via print statements, file writing to to_file.",
  "flows": "Input arguments -> class instantiation (LabeledSystem, MultiSystems, System) -> data processing -> output via print or file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward command-line interface for data conversion, relying on external classes whose internal security is unknown but presumed benign. It parses arguments, instantiates appropriate classes, and outputs data. No network activity, code injection, or malicious logic is present. The code structure is standard, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The external classes are assumed safe; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. The logic is clear and typical for such utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI wrapper for data format conversion with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low risk ~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
