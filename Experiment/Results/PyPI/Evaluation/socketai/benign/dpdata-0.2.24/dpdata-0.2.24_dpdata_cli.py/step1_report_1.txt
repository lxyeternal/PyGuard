{
  "purpose": "Provides a command line interface (CLI) for manipulating and converting atomic simulation data files in various formats.",
  "sources": "Reads user input from command line arguments; reads data from specified files via class methods (e.g., from_file).",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to files or standard output (print); potential data exposure if file paths or data are sensitive.",
  "flows": "Command line args -> parse arguments -> select data handling class -> load data -> convert or output data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, no suspicious network activity, no embedded backdoors or malicious commands.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily parses command line arguments to perform data conversion tasks via class methods. It employs standard argparse for input handling, uses class methods for file operations, and prints output. No external or untrusted data is directly executed. No code injection points, no network communication, and no data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code structure is typical for CLI tools. It does not contain hidden or suspicious logic; all functions and class usage appear benign. The overall design is consistent with a data processing utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard CLI utility for data format conversions without any signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. No malware, malicious data leaks, or backdoors are detected.",
