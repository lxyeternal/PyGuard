  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a plugin-based system for format handling, with registration decorators, abstract methods, and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The plugin registration pattern is standard.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, given no evident security issues.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No issues detected.  \n**Recommendation:** Keep scores as-is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the plugin registration and extension points, with no malicious indicators.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No malicious or suspicious elements.\n**Recommendation:** Maintain current scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Reiterates that the code is a plugin architecture for data formats, with safe registration and conversion methods.\n- **Findings:** No external network, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with the code. No issues.\n**Recommendation:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; the code is a plugin interface for data format conversions.\n- **Findings:** No direct I/O or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — very low, appropriate for a framework component.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n**Recommendation:** Keep as-is.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a plugin system for data formats, with registration and conversion methods.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity, code injection, or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully consistent. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Analysis:**\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All 0, as the code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), but all are reasonable given the code's nature as a plugin framework with no external data handling or security issues.\n\n### **My Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, as it's a plugin interface with no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard plugin architecture for format handling, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores reflect this well.\n\n**Final recommendations:** No changes needed. The code appears safe and well-structured for its purpose.",
