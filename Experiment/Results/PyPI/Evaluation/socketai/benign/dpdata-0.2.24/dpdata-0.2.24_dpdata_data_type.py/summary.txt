  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of data type management and validation with plugin extensibility. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are detected. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified; the slight risk score accounts for the unconventional AnyInt class but does not indicate a real threat."
