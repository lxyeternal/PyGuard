  "purpose": "A plugin management system allowing registration, retrieval, and merging of plugins via decorators.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided through function parameters and class attributes; no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Retrieval of plugins via get_plugin; registration via decorator; merging via __add__.",
  "flows": "Plugins are registered through decorators, stored in self.plugins; get_plugin retrieves plugins; __add__ merges plugin dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, well-structured plugin registry class with registration, retrieval, and merging capabilities. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted data beyond storing provided objects. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward plugin management utility with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
