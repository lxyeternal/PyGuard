  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It defines version variables (__version__, __version_tuple__, version, version_tuple).\n- The version string is hardcoded as `'0.2.24'`.\n- The version tuple is `(0, 2, 24)`.\n- It uses a standard `TYPE_CHECKING` block for type hints.\n- No external inputs, dynamic code, network calls, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated by setuptools-scm, a common version management tool.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  No, the code is straightforward and contains no vulnerabilities or malicious code.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None apparent. The code is standard for version management, with no logical errors or security flaws.\n\n- **Scores assigned by reports:**\n  - Malware: all reports assign 0.\n  - Obfuscated: all assign 0.\n  - Security risk: all assign 0.\n  - Confidence: all 1.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes, given the code's benign nature, the scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is correct; no malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is correct; no security risks are evident.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- Some reports mention \"auto-generated\" and \"standard practices,\" which are accurate.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are justified by the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a typical version info setup, with no security concerns.\n- The scores assigned by the reports are consistent and justified.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is static, auto-generated version metadata with no external inputs, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior. The reports' evaluations are accurate and aligned with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores are appropriate, and there are no anomalies or overlooked issues.",
