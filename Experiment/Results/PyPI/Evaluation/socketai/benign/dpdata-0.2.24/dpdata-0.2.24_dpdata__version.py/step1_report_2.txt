{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, primarily for version control and package management.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings ('0.2.24') assigned to __version__, version, and __version_tuple__.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions or outputs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; all data is hardcoded and there are no untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of TYPE_CHECKING conditional and type annotations, but no suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables with static values, uses standard type hinting practices with conditional imports, and contains no external input handling or dynamic code execution. The structure appears to be auto-generated by a version control tool (setuptools-scm). There are no suspicious or malicious constructs such as network calls, data leaks, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define version information for the package. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation is present.",
