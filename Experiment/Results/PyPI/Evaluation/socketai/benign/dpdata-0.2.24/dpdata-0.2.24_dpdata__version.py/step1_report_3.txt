  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, import statements within type checking block.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, static definitions without dynamic or untrusted input flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard version definition practices.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables for a Python package, with conditional type checking imports. No external data is read at runtime, and there are no suspicious behaviors or malicious code patterns. The presence of static version strings and type hints is typical for package version metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard version metadata for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
