{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, and manages version variables.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string '__version__' and version tuple '__version_tuple__'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external output that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; all data is static and hardcoded within the module.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of TYPE_CHECKING block is standard for type hints; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares version variables, with static assignment of version string and tuple. The use of type checking conditional is common for compatibility. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed. There are no code execution, network operations, or credential handling mechanisms. The code is minimal and appears to be auto-generated for version management, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely managing version information for a Python package. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are present.",
