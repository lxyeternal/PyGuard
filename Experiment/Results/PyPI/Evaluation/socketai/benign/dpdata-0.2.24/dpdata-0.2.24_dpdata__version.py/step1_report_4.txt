  "purpose": "Define version information and related constants for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, including static string definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data assignments only.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; all data is statically defined.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard version info setup.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version-related variables, with no input reading or external data processing. It conditionally defines a type alias based on TYPE_CHECKING, which is a common pattern for type hints. The version strings and tuples are hardcoded and static, with no external dependencies or code execution. No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign version info setup for a Python package. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
