  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version metadata module. It only declares static version strings and tuples, with conditional type hints. There are no dynamic behaviors, external inputs, or code execution. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard for package versioning.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly note that the code is static, uses standard patterns, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The obfuscated score is also 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation. The security risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely static, auto-generated version info, with no external data handling, no code execution, and no malicious patterns, raising the risk, malware, or obfuscated scores above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware and Obfuscated Scores**:  \n   - **Malware**: 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated**: 0, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n6. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions. They correctly interpret the code as benign, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis provided. All reports correctly identify the code as harmless.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \nGiven the static, auto-generated nature of the code, and the absence of any suspicious or malicious patterns, I would assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0**  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0**  \n- **Risk Score**: **0**  \n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the code's characteristics.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is benign, standard version metadata, with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores should reflect this, remaining at zero across malware, obfuscation, and risk.",
