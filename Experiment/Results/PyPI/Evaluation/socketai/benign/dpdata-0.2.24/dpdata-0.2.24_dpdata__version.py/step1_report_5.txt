  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, and sets version variables.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and version tuple values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version data to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains straightforward variable definitions and assignments for version information. It uses conditional type checking and defines version data as static strings and tuples. No dynamic execution, user input, or external data sources are involved. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. It is a standard pattern for version management in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely handling version metadata with no security risks or malicious behaviors detected.",
