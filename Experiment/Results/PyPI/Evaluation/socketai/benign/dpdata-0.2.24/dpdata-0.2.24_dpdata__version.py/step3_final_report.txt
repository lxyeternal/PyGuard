It is a typical auto-generated version info module with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. All signals indicate benign, static code with proper structure and no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static version metadata with no security concerns or malicious intent. The provided reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate.",
