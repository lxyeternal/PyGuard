  "sinks": "Console print statement in '_current_date_changed' method.",
  "flows": "User updates 'current_date' -> triggers '_current_date_changed' -> prints old and new dates.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, no external network activity, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward GUI component built with standard libraries, managing internal state with static data. The only output is a benign print statement on date change. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The code's structure and content are clear and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard GUI date selector with styling, containing no malicious or security risks. The minimal print statement on date change is typical for debugging or informational purposes. The code poses no threat, and the security scores should reflect this.",
