  "conclusion": "The code is a controlled test harness executing local, trusted example scripts. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The primary concern is the use of exec(), which is acceptable here due to the controlled environment. The security risk is low, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a moderate risk score (~0.2) justified by the context."
