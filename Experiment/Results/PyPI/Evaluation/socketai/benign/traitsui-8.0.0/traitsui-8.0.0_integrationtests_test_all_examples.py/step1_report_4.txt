  "purpose": "This code is designed for testing and validating example Python files within a project, including running files and skipping certain files based on conditions.",
  "sources": "The code reads files from specified directories (`DEMO` and `TUTORIALS`), particularly Python source files (.py), through os.walk in get_python_files() and open() when running files.",
  "sinks": "The code executes the content of selected Python files via exec() inside run_file(), and also calls run_file() for each accepted file. It patches sys.argv and sys.stdout to control execution environment. No untrusted input is directly used as code or in system calls.",
  "flows": "Files are collected, possibly skipped based on conditions, then read and executed within a controlled environment using exec(). The execution environment is patched for sys.argv and sys.stdout, but no external data or network communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses exec() to run file contents directly, which can be risky if executed files contain malicious code, but this is part of a testing framework for example files. No hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The skip conditions are based on platform and toolkit, which are legitimate controls. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages the collection, filtering, and execution of example Python files for testing purposes. It uses standard Python modules and well-defined controls for skipping files based on environment conditions. The run_file() function executes file content directly, but only on pre-vetted, known example scripts, which is typical in testing scenarios. No indications of malicious intent or malware, such as network communication, data theft, or system manipulation, are present. The use of exec() is controlled and limited to trusted example files. The code does not interact with external sources, handle untrusted inputs, or contain obfuscated or suspicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a controlled testing framework for executing example scripts within a project. It does not show signs of malicious behavior or malware. The use of exec() is a potential security consideration but is justified in this context since only trusted, local example files are executed. No malicious signals or suspicious anomalies detected.",
