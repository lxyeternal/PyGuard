  "purpose": "The code is a test harness designed to discover, filter, and execute Python scripts from specified directories for testing purposes. It patches GUI functions to prevent blocking during tests and executes scripts via exec() within a controlled environment.",
  "sources": "Filesystem files read via open(), directory traversal with os.walk, and file content read into memory.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing the content of the read files.",
  "flows": "Filesystem traversal and reading files -> passing file content to exec() for execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on external files, which could be malicious if files are compromised; no obfuscation or hidden code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically discovers Python files, filters them based on skip conditions, and executes their content via exec(). The primary security concern is executing external code, which is inherent in test harnesses. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The environment is controlled, and the files are known test scripts. The use of exec() introduces some risk, but given the context, it is acceptable. The code patches GUI functions to prevent blocking, which is standard in testing environments. Overall, the code's behavior is consistent with a trusted testing utility, with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a controlled test harness executing local, trusted example scripts. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are detected. The primary concern is the use of exec(), which is acceptable here due to the controlled environment. The security risk is low, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a moderate risk score (~0.2) justified by the context.",
