  "purpose": "Define data models for Person and Team with GUI views using TraitsUI",
  "sources": "Import statements for traits.api and traitsui.api; class attributes; list initialization of Person objects",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; no external data output or network communication; no code execution based on untrusted input",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; data is static and used for GUI display",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network calls, or system modifications",
  "analysis": "The code creates data models with GUI views for Person and Team objects, including predefined sample data. No input from external sources, no data leaks, and no potentially malicious code behaviors are present. The code's purpose appears to be for GUI-based data entry or display, with no evidence of malicious or sabotage intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data model and GUI setup with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It solely manages local data structures and visual representations.",
