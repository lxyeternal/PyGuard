  "purpose": "Define and display data models for Person and Team with GUI views using Traits UI",
  "sources": "Reads data from hardcoded list of Person objects; user inputs via GUI elements",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted user input through GUI fields, but primarily used for display and data entry",
  "flows": "User inputs data via GUI -> Data stored in Person and Team objects; no data flows to external systems",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors; use of standard Traits UI patterns",
  "analysis": "The code establishes data classes Person and Team with GUI views for data entry/display. It uses hardcoded sample data and standard traits for validation. No network activity, no file operations, no code injection or obfuscated code. No indication of malicious intent. The code’s purpose is to model and visually edit team data, with no external data leaks or harmful behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of data models with GUI components for data visualization and editing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for user data input/display purposes.",
