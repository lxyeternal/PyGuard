  "purpose": "Defines data models for Person and Team with GUI views using Traits and TraitsUI.",
  "sources": "Static data initialization for Person instances; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data output, network activity, or code execution.",
  "flows": "Data is statically defined; no dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements simple data classes with Traits and TraitsUI for GUI display. It uses static sample data and does not perform any network communication, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. The regex for phone numbers enforces format but does not introduce security issues. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a data model with GUI components. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores are appropriately set to zero across malware, obfuscation, and security risk categories.",
