  "purpose": "Define Person and Team classes with traits and create a sample team with data, primarily for UI display.",
  "sources": "Reads trait definitions, sample data initialization, class attribute assignments, and configuration of traits view.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations to external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data models for persons and teams using traits, and creates sample data for UI display. It does not process external input, perform network operations, or include code that could be exploited or used maliciously. The traits system is purely for data validation and UI representation. There are no suspicious behaviors, code injections, or data leaks. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard usage patterns of traits and traitsui libraries.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard implementation of data models for UI display with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
