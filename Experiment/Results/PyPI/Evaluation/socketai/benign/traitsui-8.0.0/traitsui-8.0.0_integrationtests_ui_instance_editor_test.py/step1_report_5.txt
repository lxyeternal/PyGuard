  "purpose": "Define data models for Person and Team with traits-based validation and GUI view configuration",
  "sources": "Imports from traits.api and traitsui.api; creation of Person and Team instances; hardcoded sample data",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no external data handling or output streams involved",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; data is statically defined and used internally",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious patterns; code adheres to standard traits usage",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes Person and Team with traits validation, including a regex for phone number validation. Sample data is statically assigned. No input/output operations, network communications, or external data handling are present. The use of traits and GUI views does not introduce security risks. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The code appears to be straightforward and intended for data modeling and UI representation, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data modeling with traits, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not pose any supply chain security threats.",
