{
  "purpose": "Defines 'Person' and 'Team' classes using Traits for data modeling and GUI display.",
  "sources": "Static data in 'people' list, Traits UI components for GUI input and display.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; user input modifies in-memory objects only.",
  "flows": "User interactions update in-memory data; no external data transfer or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of data models with Traits and TraitsUI, with static sample data. It does not perform any network, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. No external data sources or sinks are present. The use of Traits components is standard and does not introduce security vulnerabilities. No obfuscation or malicious code is evident. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Traits-based GUI data modeling script with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data flows. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the analysis and accurately reflect the minimal security concern.",
