{
  "purpose": "Define and manage 'Person' and 'Team' data models with traits and user interfaces.",
  "sources": "Input data: hardcoded 'people' list; trait default values; possible external trait data if modified.",
  "sinks": "Trait definitions could be used in UI or data storage, but no direct untrusted data handling or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded 'people' list into 'Person' instances, which are assigned to 'Team' object; no external untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code; the code is straightforward and typical for traits UI applications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines simple data models using traits and traitsui for UI representation. The 'people' list contains static, hardcoded data. The 'Person' class uses standard traits with validation (e.g., phone regex). The 'Team' class references 'Person' instances. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. The code appears to be a standard data management example without malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of data models and UI components with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
