  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build setup script for pyuwsgi with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate. The security risk score (0.2) reflects the reliance on environment variables, which could be exploited if the environment is compromised, but this is a common risk in build scripts and not indicative of malicious intent."
