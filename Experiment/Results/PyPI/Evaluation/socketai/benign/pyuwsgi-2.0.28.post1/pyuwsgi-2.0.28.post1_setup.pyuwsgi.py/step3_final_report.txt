  "purpose": "Build and install uWSGI as a Python module, providing a wrapper and configuration setup for the uWSGI server.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., UWSGI_PROFILE), filesystem operations (os.makedirs, os.unlink), configuration files (uwsgiconfig), build commands (build_uwsgi).",
  "sinks": "Filesystem modifications (creating directories, deleting files), build processes, configuration manipulations.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence profile selection and configuration; configuration data guides build steps; filesystem operations support build setup.",
  "anomalies": "Comments referencing 'hack', 'FIXME', and 'XXX' suggest unconventional or incomplete implementation but no malicious intent; no suspicious code patterns or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code automates building and installing uWSGI as a Python module, manipulating environment variables and filesystem paths to configure build parameters. It does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications beyond typical build procedures. Comments indicating 'hack' or 'fix' are about installation workarounds, not malicious actions. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and context.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard build setup for a Python wrapper around uWSGI, with no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The low risk score reflects typical build configuration manipulations without malicious intent.",
