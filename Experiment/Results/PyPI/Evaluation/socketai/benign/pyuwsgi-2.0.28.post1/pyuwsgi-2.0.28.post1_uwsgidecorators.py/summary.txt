  "conclusion": "The code is a utility framework with no active malicious behavior but contains a significant security vulnerability due to unsafe pickle deserialization of untrusted data. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is high at 0.75. It is recommended to replace pickle with safer serialization methods or implement strict validation to mitigate potential exploitation."
