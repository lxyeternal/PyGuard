  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build automation script for uWSGI with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The configuration manipulations and filesystem operations are standard for such scripts. The risk is low, primarily related to environment variable manipulation, which is typical in build processes. The scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a low risk score (~0.2-0.3), are justified and accurate."
