  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, legitimate testing script for uWSGI reload behavior. It involves process and filesystem interactions typical in server testing environments. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting the controlled, benign nature of the script."
