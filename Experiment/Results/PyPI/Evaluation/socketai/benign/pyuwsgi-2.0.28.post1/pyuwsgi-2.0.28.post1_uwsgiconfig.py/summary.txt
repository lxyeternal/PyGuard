  "conclusion": "The code is a complex build system that, while not malicious by design, contains multiple vectors (dynamic execution, external resource fetching, shell commands) that could be exploited maliciously if inputs are compromised. The current scores in the reports are appropriate, with the malware score justified at approximately 0.9 and overall risk around 0.85. To mitigate risks, input validation, sandboxing, and avoiding shell=True are recommended. The code's capabilities for executing arbitrary commands and fetching remote code make it highly dangerous if misused or compromised."
