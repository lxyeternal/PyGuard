  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'slugify' Python package, used to configure package metadata and build process.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'src/slugify.py' file to extract version information.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or inputs are processed or executed in a risky manner.",
  "flows": "Read file content -> Regex search for version -> Return version string",
  "anomalies": "Use of distutils for setup (not suspicious by itself), no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no external data sources, or malicious payloads observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads the source file 'src/slugify.py' to extract version information using a regex. It then passes this information along with other package metadata to the setup() function. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior. The use of lambda functions and file handling appears standard. No obfuscation, no backdoors, or malicious code are present. The script functions solely as a package setup utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected tasks without suspicious or malicious behavior.",
