{
  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python setup script that reads the package version from a source file and configures package metadata using distutils.",
  "sources": "Reading 'src/slugify.py' to extract __version__ via regex.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads a local file and passes data to setup().",
  "flows": "Read file -> regex extract version -> pass to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a straightforward package setup, reading version info from a source file without executing code or handling untrusted input. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is present. The regex assumes a well-formed version string but does not pose a security risk. The code's simplicity and standard structure indicate no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The minimal security risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, but could be set to zero for accuracy.",
