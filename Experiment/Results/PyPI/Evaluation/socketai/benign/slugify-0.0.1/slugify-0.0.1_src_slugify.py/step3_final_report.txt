  "purpose": "Convert Unicode strings into URL-friendly slugs by normalizing, removing non-word characters, and replacing whitespace/hyphens with hyphens.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter 'string' provided to slugify function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code performs in-memory string processing only.",
  "flows": "Input string -> Unicode normalization -> ASCII encoding -> Regex substitution -> Lowercase conversion -> Output slug string.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'unicode()' function, which is undefined in Python 3, leading to potential runtime error; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard slugification steps but relies on 'unicode()', a Python 2 built-in, which causes compatibility issues in Python 3. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The core logic is straightforward and safe. The main concern is environment compatibility, not security. No suspicious patterns or external data flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward slugify utility with a compatibility issue due to outdated syntax. It contains no malware or malicious intent. The primary recommendation is to replace 'unicode()' with 'str()' for Python 3 compatibility. The current security risk is negligible, and the malware score remains 0.",
