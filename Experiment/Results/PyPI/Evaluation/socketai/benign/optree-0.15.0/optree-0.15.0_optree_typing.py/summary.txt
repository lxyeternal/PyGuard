  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility module intended for internal type and data structure validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by its utility nature and lack of external interactions."
