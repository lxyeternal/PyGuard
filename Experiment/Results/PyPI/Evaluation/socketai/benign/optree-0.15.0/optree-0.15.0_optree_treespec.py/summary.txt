  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup module for the optree library, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The aliasing of built-in names is a common practice in library code and does not indicate malicious intent. All evidence supports that this code is safe and intended solely for API exposure."
