  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clear, focused on extending functools.partial for pytrees; no external or untrusted input sources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns; standard implementation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a benign extension, with no malicious behavior or backdoors. The risk score of 0.0 is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard extension practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious indicators; the implementation appears legitimate. Risk score of 0.0 fits.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Slightly less confident (0.9), but still no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; the code is a utility for functional programming. Risk score of 0.0 or very close is justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Fully confident (1.0), no anomalies detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above; no malicious intent or security issues. Risk score of 0.0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Complete analysis with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe extension for pytrees. Risk score of 0.0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Security Risks:** None evident; the code is a straightforward extension for functional programming.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malware or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — no security risk identified.\n\nThis code is a benign, well-structured utility module that extends `functools.partial` for compatibility with pytrees. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n**Final recommendations:** No changes needed. The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0",
