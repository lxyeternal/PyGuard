The use of internal introspection functions is standard in such frameworks and does not pose significant security risks. The overall security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), and malware and obfuscation scores are zero."

There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1), justified by its utility nature and lack of external interactions."

The only minimal risk involves the 'codify' method generating code strings that could be misused if evaluated insecurely outside this context. Overall, the supply chain security risk is very low."
