  "purpose": "Utility functions for sequence sorting, zipping, and unzipping with error handling and type safety.",
  "sources": "Input sequences provided to sorting, safe_zip, and unzip2 functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions; functions operate on provided data only.",
  "flows": "Input sequences flow into functions; sorting and unzipping produce output sequences; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, well-structured, and free of suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard sequence manipulation utilities with appropriate error handling, fallback mechanisms, and type annotations. No external data, network operations, or environment variable usage are present. The functions do not process untrusted data maliciously; they handle errors gracefully. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or supply chain risks are evident. The high confidence scores are justified given the code's clarity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility module for sequence operations. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are accurate and appropriate.",
