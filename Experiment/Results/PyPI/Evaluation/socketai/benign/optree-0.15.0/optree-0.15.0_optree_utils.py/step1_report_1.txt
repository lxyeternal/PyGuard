  "purpose": "Utility functions for sorting, zipping, and unzipping sequences, designed to handle edge cases and ensure type safety.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions (iterable sequences).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as there are no functions that handle untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "Input sequences are processed directly within functions; no external data flow or external system interaction is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code primarily handles sequence processing with try-except blocks for robustness.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions for sorting iterables with fallback mechanisms, a strict zip implementation that raises errors on length mismatches, and an unzip function for sequences of pairs. The sorting function attempts to handle objects that may not be directly comparable, adding class information to keys for comparison. The zip function enforces equal length across all sequences, preventing potential runtime errors. The unzip function explicitly separates pairs into two sequences. No external data inputs, environment variables, or network operations are present. The functions are utility-based and do not perform any system or network operations, nor do they process untrusted input in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module for sequence operations with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is well-structured, handles errors gracefully, and contains no external data flows or unsafe operations.",
