{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for sorting, zipping, and unzipping iterables, mainly used for data manipulation and ordering.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from iterable parameters in functions (e.g., iterable, args in safe_zip, xys in unzip2).",
  "sinks": "The code does not include sinks such as data output, network transmission, or system modification; it only processes data in memory.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions, which manipulate and return sorted or zipped versions of the input; no external data flow or external side effects are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are detected. The functions include exception handling for sorting errors and enforce equal length in zip, which are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for sorting, zipping, and unzipping sequences. Sorting handles non-comparable objects via a fallback key function. The safe_zip function enforces equal sequence lengths and raises an error if mismatched. unzip2 separates a sequence of pairs into two sequences, avoiding lazy evaluation pitfalls. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. No use of environment variables or insecure operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be well-structured utility functions with no malicious intent. It performs data manipulation safely and does not contain suspicious or harmful behavior. No security risks or malware indications are detected.",
