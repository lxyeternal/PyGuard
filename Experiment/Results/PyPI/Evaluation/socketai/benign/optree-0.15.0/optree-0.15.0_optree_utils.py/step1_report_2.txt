  "purpose": "Utility functions for sorting, zipping, and unzipping iterables in Python.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; uses input parameters such as iterables and callables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks or untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no external data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions: total_order_sorted for sorting with fallback for non-comparable objects, safe_zip for zipping multiple iterables with length validation, and unzip2 for splitting tuples into separate sequences. The implementation relies solely on standard Python features and does not process untrusted input in a malicious way. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be well-structured and secure, intended for safe handling of iterable data structures without external or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs standard operations with safeguards and fallback mechanisms. No security concerns are identified.",
