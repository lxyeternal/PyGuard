  "purpose": "Utility functions for sorting, zipping, and unzipping iterables with enhanced safety and compatibility features.",
  "sources": "Reads input iterables provided as arguments to functions such as total_order_sorted, safe_zip, and unzip2.",
  "flows": "Input iterables flow into sorting, zipping, and unzipping functions; data processing occurs locally within these functions with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for sorting and manipulating iterables, handling type differences and potential sorting issues. Exception handling is used for robustness, and input validation ensures consistent zip lengths. No external data sources, network communication, or hidden behaviors are present. The functions perform straightforward, well-documented data processing tasks, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This module contains benign utility functions focused on iterable manipulation. No malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain threats are evident. The code appears well-structured and safe for use.",
