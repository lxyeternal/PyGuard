{
  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for sorting, zipping, and unzipping sequences, mainly for handling collections and custom ordering.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read external input; data is passed directly through parameters.",
  "targets": "None of the functions write data externally; they operate on provided iterable objects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input iterables through sorting, zipping, or unzipping functions internally without external data dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code includes standard exception handling for type errors, normal for utility functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions: total_order_sorted for sorting with fallback mechanisms, safe_zip for zipped iteration with length checks, and unzip2 for separating pairs. The functions include normal error handling and type annotations. No external data input is read, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The code appears to be standard collection utilities with no signs of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of benign utility functions for sorting and manipulating sequences. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and do not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior.",
