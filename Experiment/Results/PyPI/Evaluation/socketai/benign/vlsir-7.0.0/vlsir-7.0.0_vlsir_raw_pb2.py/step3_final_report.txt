  "purpose": "Auto-generated protobuf schema definitions for various data structures related to circuit design, layout, and geometric data, used for data serialization.",
  "sources": "Imports of protobuf modules and serialized descriptor data defining message types and enums.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only defines message types and registration routines, with no data processing or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, generated protobuf definitions with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of protobuf message definitions, enum wrappers, and registration routines. It is generated by the protobuf compiler, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated protobuf schema with no security concerns or malicious intent. It poses no threat and is safe for use in larger systems.",
