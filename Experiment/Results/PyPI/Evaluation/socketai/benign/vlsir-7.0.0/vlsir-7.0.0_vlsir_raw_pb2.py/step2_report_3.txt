  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states that this is auto-generated protobuf code for 'vlsir.raw' namespace, imported modules are standard protobuf and other generated files. No issues here.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data sinks or flows, only message definitions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, code obfuscation, or malicious constructs. It’s standard protobuf code.\n- **Conclusion:** Confirmed as normal auto-generated protobuf schema with no malware or security risk.\n\n**Score implications:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the autogenerated nature, standard imports, and message registration.  \n- No runtime logic, data processing, or external data handling evident.  \n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Score implications:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Again, describes auto-generated protobuf definitions with standard imports and message registration.  \n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.  \n- Purpose is solely data serialization.\n\n**Score implications:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar pattern: generated protobuf code, no runtime logic, no external data handling, no suspicious constructs.  \n- No anomalies or signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Score implications:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same conclusion: auto-generated protobuf definitions, standard imports, no executable logic, no data sinks or flows that could lead to security issues.  \n- No anomalies or obfuscation.\n\n**Score implications:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify this as auto-generated protobuf code, which is inherently benign.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior across all reports.\n- **Security Risk:** The nature of protobuf schema definitions, especially when auto-generated, poses minimal security risk.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The scores assigned in all reports are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Additional comments:**  \n- The code is standard protobuf generated code, used for data serialization in larger systems.  \n- Since it does not process untrusted data directly, and contains no runtime logic, it is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0\n\nThis is a safe, standard protobuf schema definition with no security concerns.",
