  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that this is an auto-generated protobuf module with no suspicious logic, secrets, or dynamic execution.  \n- **Scores:** Malware score = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low).  \n- **Justification:** Since no malicious behavior or obfuscation is detected, these scores are reasonable. The low risk score reflects the inherent nature of protobuf generated code, which is generally safe.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it describes the code as a generated schema without runtime data processing or external inputs.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** The scores are appropriate; no malicious activity or obfuscation is present.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Again, the analysis confirms the code is a standard protobuf schema with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** Consistent with the previous reports, the scores are justified.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is auto-generated, with no runtime logic or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** These scores seem reasonable given the nature of the code.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar conclusion: auto-generated protobuf definitions with no malicious or suspicious features.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** Appropriate scores for this context.  \n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since the code is generated protobuf definitions, not obfuscated or intentionally obscured.  \n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1), which aligns with the fact that this is static, schema-defining code with no runtime or external data processing.  \n\n### My Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, inherent to the nature of generated protobuf code but not a security concern)  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The scores are appropriate given the nature of the code. No changes are necessary. The code is a standard, safe protobuf schema module with no security risks.",
