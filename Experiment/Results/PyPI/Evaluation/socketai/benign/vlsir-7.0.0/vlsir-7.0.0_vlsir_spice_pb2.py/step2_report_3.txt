  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard auto-generated protobuf module with no suspicious logic, secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Given the nature of the code, a malware score of 0 is appropriate. The security risk is minimal (0.1), which aligns with the fact that it’s just schema definitions.\n- **Obfuscation:** Clearly not obfuscated.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as safe, with high confidence (0.9).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, this is a generated protobuf schema module with no malicious activity.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate; no suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not obfuscated.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, with full confidence (1.0).\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Also a standard protobuf schema module, with no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Risk & Malware Scores:** Malware score of 0 is justified; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not obfuscated.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct, with high confidence (1.0).\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard protobuf generated code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware score of 0 is correct; no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate, high confidence (1.0).\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the others; generated protobuf code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware score of 0 is appropriate; no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct, with full confidence (1.0).\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify a malware score of 0. The code is purely schema definitions with no runtime logic or data handling that could be malicious.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly assign 0; the code is straightforward generated protobuf code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but generally very low (0.1 to 0.2), which is reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely auto-generated protobuf definitions, with no dynamic execution, no embedded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious logic.\n- The high confidence levels are justified because the code is standard, well-structured, and typical of protobuf generated modules.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, inherent to any code that could be misused if integrated insecurely, but not within this code itself)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate, considering its role as a schema definition module.",
