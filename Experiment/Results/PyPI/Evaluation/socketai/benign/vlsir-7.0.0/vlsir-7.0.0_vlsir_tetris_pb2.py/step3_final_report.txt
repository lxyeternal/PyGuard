{
  "purpose": "This code is auto-generated protobuf schema definitions for the 'vlsir.tetris' module, including message classes, descriptors, and registration routines, with no runtime logic or external effects.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from serialized descriptor bytes and imported protobuf modules, which are standard in protobuf generated files.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or external data flows occur; the code only defines data structures.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only sets up message types and descriptors.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present; the code is straightforward protobuf schema.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical protobuf generated module with message definitions, descriptors, and registration. It contains no executable logic, no dynamic code execution, no network or file I/O, and no obfuscation. The serialized descriptor data is standard and not malicious. All imported modules are standard protobuf packages. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The code's structure and content are consistent with schema definitions, and the scores reflect this.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely schema definitions generated by the protobuf compiler, with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
