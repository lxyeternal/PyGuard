  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the claims and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is auto-generated protobuf code, defining message classes, descriptors, and registration routines.\n- No runtime logic, data processing, network communication, or external effects are present.\n- The serialized descriptor data is typical for protobuf files.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk scores of 0.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code is auto-generated protobuf code from 'tetris.proto', with imports and descriptors.\n\n**Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no suspicious code.\n\n**Conclusion & Scores:**  \n- The assessment that the code is benign and purely schema definitions is accurate.  \n- Malware score: 0 (correct).  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct).  \n- Security risk: 0 (correct).\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as protobuf message definitions, with standard imports and descriptors.\n\n**Analysis & Anomalies:** No runtime behaviors, no external effects, no suspicious code.\n\n**Conclusion & Scores:**  \n- The conclusion that the code is benign protobuf schema code is valid.  \n- Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code is protobuf definitions for circuit layout data structures, with imports and descriptors.\n\n**Analysis & Anomalies:** No runtime logic, no external effects, standard protobuf code.\n\n**Conclusion & Scores:**  \n- The assessment that the code is schema-only and safe is correct.  \n- Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes that the code is protobuf schema definitions, with no external or runtime effects.\n\n**Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion & Scores:**  \n- The conclusion that the code is benign schema code is accurate.  \n- Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as protobuf message definitions for the 'tetris' module, with no suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Analysis & Anomalies:** No runtime logic, no external effects, typical generated code.\n\n**Conclusion & Scores:**  \n- The conclusion that the code is safe and schema-only is correct.  \n- Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security risk: 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as auto-generated protobuf schema definitions.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- The confidence levels of 1 are justified given the standard nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Personal Estimation:**\n\nBased on the thorough review, I agree with the given scores.\n\n**- Malware score:** 0  \n**- Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**- Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, purely schema definitions, with no malicious intent or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, well-reasoned, and consistent with the nature of the code.
