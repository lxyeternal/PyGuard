{
  "purpose": "This code sets up protobuf module imports and manages namespace conflicts for a Python package, providing version info and utility types.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal protobuf-generated modules and a version string declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; purely static imports and namespace setup.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; only internal module imports and namespace exposure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup module that imports protobuf modules and exposes utility types, with comments explaining namespace management. It contains no dynamic operations, external communications, or security-sensitive actions. All indicators point to benign, structural code intended for package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The initial reports correctly identify its nature, and the assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
