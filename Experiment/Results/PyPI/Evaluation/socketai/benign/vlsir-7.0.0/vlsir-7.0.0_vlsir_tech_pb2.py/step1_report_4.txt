{
  "purpose": "Generated protocol buffer code for serialization and deserialization of 'tech.proto' data structures.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.protobuf modules, serialized file data for descriptors.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling or external connections present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely generated code defining data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Generated code with no custom logic, no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or malicious instructions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard output from the protobuf compiler, defining message descriptors for data serialization. It imports protobuf modules, constructs descriptors from serialized data, and sets up message classes. No dynamic code execution, no network operations, or suspicious constructs are present. The code's purpose is purely to define data structures, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical generated protobuf module with no malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
