  "purpose": "Auto-generated protobuf code defining message classes based on embedded serialized descriptors for 'vlsir.utils'.",
  "sources": "Loading serialized protobuf descriptor data from a static byte string.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data input, network, or file I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static descriptor loading only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard auto-generated protobuf code with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard protobuf generated module that loads descriptors from a static byte string. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling. The embedded data is typical for protobuf code and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious patterns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk approximately 0.1) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, auto-generated protobuf descriptor module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score is appropriate given its static, benign nature.",
