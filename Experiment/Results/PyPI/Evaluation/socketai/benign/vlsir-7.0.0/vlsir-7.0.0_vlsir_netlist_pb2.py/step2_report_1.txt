  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is auto-generated protobuf code, solely defining data structures without executable logic or data handling.\n- **Issues:** No issues found; the code is standard and benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, confirms the code is auto-generated protobuf schema code with no malicious behavior.\n- **Issues:** No issues; the code is safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms the code is generated protobuf code for data serialization, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Issues:** No issues; standard protobuf code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, describes the code as auto-generated protobuf schema code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Issues:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard protobuf code for data serialization, no suspicious activity.\n- **Issues:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Code presence:** The code is purely generated protobuf schema definitions with no executable logic, data processing, or network communication.\n- **Malware:** No signs of malicious behavior, payloads, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscation:** The code is straightforward, generated by protobuf compiler, with no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** The code does not handle untrusted data at runtime, nor does it perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is justified.\n- The overall security risk score should remain at 0, as the code is benign.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** All reports are accurate; the code is standard, generated protobuf code with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
