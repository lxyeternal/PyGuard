{
  "purpose": "This code defines protobuf message schemas for netlist data serialization, generated automatically by the protobuf compiler.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it loads serialized schema descriptors and sets up message classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only initializes schema descriptors without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, generated protobuf schema code with no obfuscated constructs, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard protobuf generated module that imports protobuf libraries, loads serialized schema descriptors, and builds message classes. It contains no executable logic, data processing, network communication, or runtime data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, auto-generated protobuf schema definition with no malicious or suspicious elements. The code poses no security risks and is safe for use.",
