  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies that this is auto-generated protobuf code with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity.  \n- **Malware & risk scores:** Both set to 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, confirms that this is standard protobuf schema code with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Both malware and risk are 0, consistent with the analysis.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, confirms standard protobuf generated code with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Both malware and risk are 0, which is appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above; standard protobuf code, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Both malware and risk are 0, consistent.  \n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same consistent pattern—auto-generated protobuf code with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Both malware and risk are 0, fitting the context.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence:** The code is purely generated protobuf definitions with no executable logic, no data handling, and no network operations.  \n- **Malware & obfuscation:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.  \n- **Risk level:** Given the nature of the code, the risk score should remain very low (around 0).  \n- **Malware score:** Should be 0, as there's no malicious behavior.\n\n### Final justification:\n\nAll reports correctly identify that this is a benign, auto-generated protobuf schema code. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence: static, generated code with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
