{
  "purpose": "Generated protocol buffer code for circuit definitions, not intended for direct execution or input handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from google.protobuf library and local utils_pb2; code generation process via protoc compiler.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data processing; code primarily defines data structures.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code only defines message schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; all code is standard protobuf generated code with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is auto-generated from a protobuf definition file (circuit.proto). It imports protobuf modules and sets up message descriptors. There are no input handling, network operations, environment variable accesses, or execution logic. The purpose is to define data schemas, which are static and do not process or execute untrusted data. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. All structures and code patterns follow standard protobuf code generation practices. The code does not contain any obfuscation, suspicious dynamic execution, or malicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard protobuf-generated module for circuit data schemas. It poses no security risk, malware, or malicious intent. It solely defines data structures for use elsewhere. Based on the content and structure, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
