  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and reading local README for description.",
  "sources": "Reading 'readme.md' file for long description",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs processed in a harmful way",
  "flows": "Reading local file to assign long_description; no data flows to untrusted sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, conventional setup script with no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script utilizing setuptools and pathlib. It reads a local README file, assigns package metadata, dependencies, and optional extras. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or handling of untrusted data. The code structure is clear, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present. All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero, consistent with the benign nature of the script. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and standard practice nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its safety, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
