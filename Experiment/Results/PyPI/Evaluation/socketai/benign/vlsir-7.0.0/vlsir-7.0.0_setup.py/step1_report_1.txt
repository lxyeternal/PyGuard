  "purpose": "The script is a setup configuration for a Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README file for long description, imports setuptools and pathlib modules, defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no execution of untrusted data or code, no network calls, no credential handling.",
  "flows": "Reads local README file, sets package metadata and dependencies; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks using setuptools, reading a local README file for description, specifying dependencies, and defining package metadata. It does not execute untrusted data, does not include network calls, or perform any actions that could be malicious. No obfuscated code, no code injection, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script used for packaging a Python project. It contains no malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
