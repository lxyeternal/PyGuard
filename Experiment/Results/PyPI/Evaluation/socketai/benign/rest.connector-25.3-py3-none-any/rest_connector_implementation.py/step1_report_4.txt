{
  "purpose": "Defines a base class for REST connection implementation, providing method stubs for REST operations.",
  "sources": "Class definition and method stubs; no runtime input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; methods are placeholders raising NotImplementedError.",
  "flows": "No executable data flow or data transfer occurs; only method declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Contains only standard class and method definitions with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a REST connection class inheriting from BaseConnection, with placeholder methods for connect, disconnect, and HTTP verbs. It includes detailed YAML documentation, but no actual implementation or data handling. No input data reading or untrusted data processing is evident. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are present, and no obfuscation or malware signatures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard abstract base class for REST API connections with no malicious intent or security risks. It primarily serves as a template with method placeholders. No anomalies, secrets, or malicious behaviors are identified.",
