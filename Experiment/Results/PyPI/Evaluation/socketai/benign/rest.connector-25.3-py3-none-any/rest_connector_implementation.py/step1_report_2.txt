{
  "purpose": "Defines a base class for REST connection implementation in network devices, providing method stubs for HTTP operations.",
  "sources": "The code does not explicitly read input or external data sources; it defines an interface with placeholders for implementation.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain executable logic that writes or transmits data; it only defines method signatures.",
  "flows": "There are no actual data flows or execution paths in this code, as all operational methods are unimplemented.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hidden code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is a straightforward class definition with method stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a third-party library, defines a subclass for REST connection, and provides method stubs that raise NotImplementedError. There is no actual logic, data processing, or external data handling. The class appears to serve as an interface or base class for future implementation. No hardcoded credentials, malicious payloads, or suspicious code constructs are present. The inclusion of sample YAML documentation suggests intended usage but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard class definition serving as an interface for REST connections. It contains no executable logic, data handling, or potentially malicious code. The absence of data processing or network activity reduces concerns about malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears benign and purely structural.",
