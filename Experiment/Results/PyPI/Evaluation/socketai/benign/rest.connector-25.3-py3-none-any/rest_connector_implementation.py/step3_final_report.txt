{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract base class for REST connections, serving as an interface with method signatures for connection management and HTTP operations, accompanied by documentation examples. It does not contain executable logic or embedded secrets.",
  "sources": "YAML configuration examples in docstrings, credentials in documentation (not in code), no runtime data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the class only provides method signatures to be implemented by subclasses.",
  "flows": "No data flows occur within this code; it is purely structural with no data processing or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of credentials in YAML documentation as examples, but these are not embedded secrets or code; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, non-operational base class serving as an interface for REST connections. It contains no logic, data handling, or network activity. The YAML examples include credentials solely for documentation purposes. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The method signatures correctly raise NotImplementedError, indicating intended extension. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign, structural nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, non-malicious template for REST connection classes, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The inclusion of credentials in documentation is standard for illustrative purposes and does not pose a security risk. The scores are appropriate and align with the code's purpose.",
