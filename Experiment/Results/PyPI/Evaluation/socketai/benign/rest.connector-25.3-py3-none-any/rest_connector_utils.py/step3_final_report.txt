  "purpose": "Utility functions for device credential management, version checking, package download and installation, and version verification in network device management scenarios.",
  "sources": "Reading connection info (credentials, username, password), fetching web pages (APIC version info), retrieving package lists and files from HTTP responses.",
  "sinks": "Executing subprocess commands for pip installation, making HTTP GET requests to external URLs, parsing HTML responses with regex.",
  "flows": "Fetching credentials from connection info → comparing versions → downloading package files → executing pip install commands from URLs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'verify=False' in requests (disabling SSL verification), executing pip install commands with untrusted URLs via subprocess without validation, broad exception handling masking errors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs credential retrieval, version checking, and package management operations. It relies on insecure network practices such as disabling SSL verification and executing pip installs from URLs without validation, which could be exploited for remote code execution or supply chain attacks. No malicious code or obfuscation is present; the main concern is the insecure handling of network communications and package installation. These practices pose security risks but do not constitute embedded malware. The subprocess calls and HTTP requests are the primary vectors for potential exploitation. The code's design is straightforward, but insecure practices significantly elevate the security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no embedded malicious payloads but employs insecure network and package management practices that could be exploited in a supply chain attack scenario. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.65, reflecting the significant security concerns due to insecure network handling and unvalidated package installation. Addressing these issues by enabling SSL verification, validating package sources, and sanitizing inputs would mitigate the risks.",
