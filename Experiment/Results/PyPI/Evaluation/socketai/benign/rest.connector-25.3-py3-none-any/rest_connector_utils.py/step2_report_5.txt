  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the security implications step-by-step.\n\n---\n\n### **General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily utility functions for network device management, version checks, and package installation.\n- Repeatedly, the code uses `requests.get()` with `verify=False`, disabling SSL verification, which is a significant security risk.\n- The package installation via `subprocess.run()` with unvalidated URLs is potentially dangerous; malicious links could lead to remote code execution.\n- Credential handling appears to be standard, with broad exception handling that could hide errors but no evidence of malicious intent.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- The malware scores are low or zero, reflecting no explicit malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Review of Each Report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for device interaction and package management.\n- **Key issues:** Disabling SSL (`verify=False`), unvalidated package downloads, broad exception handling.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.65 (moderate to high), justified due to insecure network practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected).\n- **Assessment:** The code's insecure practices could be exploited for man-in-the-middle attacks or supply chain attacks but does not contain malicious payloads.\n\n**Verdict:** The logic is sound but insecure practices pose real risks. No change needed in scores.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Interacting with Cisco APIC, downloading, and installing packages.\n- **Key issues:** Disabling SSL verification, executing pip installs from potentially untrusted URLs, broad exception handling.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.75 (high), due to reliance on external links and insecure SSL.\n- **Malware score:** 0.5 (moderate), since malicious code could be introduced during package installation if links are compromised.\n- **Assessment:** The potential for supply chain attacks is high, especially since package URLs are not validated or signed.\n\n**Justification for malware score:** While no malicious code is embedded in the script, the risk of executing malicious code during package install is significant if the links are compromised. The malware score reflects this potential.\n\n**Recommendation:** Keep the scores as is. The high security risk is justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Managing package versions, downloads, and installations.\n- **Key issues:** Same as above—disabling SSL verification, untrusted package sources, subprocess execution.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.6 (moderate-high).\n- **Malware score:** 0.25 (low), since no explicit malicious code, but risk exists if remote sources are malicious.\n- **Assessment:** The code is similar to previous ones, with insecure network practices but no embedded malware.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Credential handling, version checking, package management.\n- **Key issues:** Same insecure network practices, no validation of remote content.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.3 (low to moderate).\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected).\n- **Assessment:** The low malware score is appropriate; the main concern is insecure network practices.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions similar to above.\n- **Key issues:** Same insecure practices.\n- **Security risk score:** 0.6.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous findings.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports are low, indicating no embedded malicious code. The main risk stems from insecure practices that could be exploited if an attacker compromises remote sources or intercepts traffic.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Justified based on insecure network practices, especially the use of `verify=False` and unvalidated package URLs.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** for all, as no malicious payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**.\n- **Security risk:** I would assign an overall risk score of **0.65** considering the insecure network practices and potential for exploitation, aligning with the highest individual report score.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Summary:**\n\nThe code does not contain malicious code or backdoors but employs insecure practices that could be exploited for malicious purposes, such as remote code execution during package installation or man-in-the-middle attacks. These vulnerabilities are significant but do not constitute embedded malware.\n\n**Final note:** It is recommended to:\n- Enforce SSL verification (`verify=True`).\n- Validate and sign downloaded packages.\n- Avoid executing subprocess commands with untrusted URLs.\n- Implement input validation for IPs and URLs.\n- Log installation activities for audit purposes.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type             | Final Estimate                 |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Malware                | 0                              |\n| Obfuscated             | 0                              |\n| Security Risk          | 0.65                           |\n\nThis reflects a codebase with significant insecure practices but no explicit malicious payloads.",
