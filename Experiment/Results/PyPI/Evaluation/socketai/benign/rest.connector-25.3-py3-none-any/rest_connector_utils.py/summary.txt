  "conclusion": "The code contains no embedded malicious payloads but employs insecure network and package management practices that could be exploited in a supply chain attack scenario. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.65, reflecting the significant security concerns due to insecure network handling and unvalidated package installation. Addressing these issues by enabling SSL verification, validating package sources, and sanitizing inputs would mitigate the risks."
