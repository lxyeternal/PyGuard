  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, confirming the presence or absence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and assessing the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes unit tests for `rest.connector` with mocked HTTP responses, no untrusted data flow into sensitive sinks.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected. Uses standard mocking.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard test code, no malware or security risks.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n- Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly scored. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar unit tests, extensive mocking, no untrusted data flow.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Tests verify SDK logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, no malicious intent or security risks.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n- Risk: 0.2 (low, justified by the nature of testing, slight concern for external dependencies but minimal)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable scoring. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Tests for connection and model retrieval, using mocked responses.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No secrets or suspicious code. Standard testing pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, safe for use.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n- Risk: 0.1 (low, typical for test code)\n\n**Verdict:** Correctly scored.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Tests for connection management, heavily relies on mocking.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Standard unit testing.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks or malware.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n- Risk: 0 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Extensive testing of `Acisdk`, with mocked responses, no untrusted data flow into sensitive sinks.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. Uses standard mocking.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or security risks.\n\n**Scores:**\n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)\n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)\n- Risk: 0.1 (low, consistent with testing context)\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe standard, well-structured unit tests with no malicious or suspicious code.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- **Scores:** All are reasonable and aligned with the content and context.\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, correctly reflecting the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Zero, consistent with clear, readable test code.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, justified by the fact that these are test suites, not production or deployment code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (already appropriately low)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The code is a standard, well-implemented unit test suite for a network SDK, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores are appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
