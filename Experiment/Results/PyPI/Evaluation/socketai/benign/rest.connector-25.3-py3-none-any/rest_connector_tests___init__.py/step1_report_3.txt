  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task or function, but the exact intent is unclear due to the absence of comments or documentation.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from environment variables, user input functions, or file reads, and possibly network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network communication, or data output functions such as print statements or file writes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables, files) to sinks (system commands, network, files), potentially passing through transformations or checks.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are detected. However, lack of comments or unusual coding patterns should be noted.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined thoroughly from start to finish. No malicious functions, network calls to suspicious domains, or hidden behaviors were observed. Usage of third-party libraries is within normal bounds. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or insecure practices are evident. The structure is straightforward, and no obfuscated or intentionally confusing code segments are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current review, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign implementation, with no indicators of malware, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. The overall security risk is low.",
