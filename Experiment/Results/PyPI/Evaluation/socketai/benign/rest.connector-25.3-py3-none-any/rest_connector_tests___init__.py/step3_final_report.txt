  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, and suspicious activities.",
  "sources": "Code segments involving dynamic execution (eval/exec), hardcoded strings, environment variable reads, user input handling, and data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through environment variables or user input, network calls, or file modifications if malicious code exists.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables could lead to sinks like network connections or file writes via dynamic execution or data handling functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, dynamic eval/exec usage, hardcoded credentials or URLs, and suspicious string patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns in Report 1, which are suspicious but not definitively malicious. Other reports lack code evidence of malicious activity, with straightforward structure and no obfuscation. Scores across reports align with their findings: Report 1 has higher obfuscation (0.7) and moderate malware suspicion (0.3), while others are benign with scores near zero. The overall security risk remains low, with the primary concern in Report 1 due to obfuscation and dynamic code patterns. No concrete malicious payloads are identified, and the suspicion is based on code characteristics rather than confirmed malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no definitive signs of malware. Report 1's obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns warrant caution but do not confirm malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with minor potential adjustments to malware suspicion slightly lowering it from 0.3 to 0.2. Overall, the dependency is low risk, but further review of obfuscated segments is recommended.",
