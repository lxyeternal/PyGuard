  "purpose": "Define a Node class used for representing nodes within a tree structure, including properties and methods for managing node identifiers, relationships, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (via sys module), standard libraries (copy, uuid, sys, collections, warnings, typing), and internal modules (.exceptions, .misc). No user input or external data sources detected.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly detected. No data outputs, network operations, or file I/O operations are present.",
  "flows": "No external or untrusted data flows identified. The code primarily manages internal data structures and properties.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains deprecated properties and methods, but they do not pose security risks. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Node class with attributes and methods for managing node identifiers, parent/child relationships, and metadata within a tree. It uses UUIDs for node IDs, which is standard for ensuring uniqueness. The class methods include deprecated properties for backward compatibility but do not introduce security risks. No external data inputs, network communication, or code execution features are present. The code relies on standard libraries and internal modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard implementation of a tree node class with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be well-structured and does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
