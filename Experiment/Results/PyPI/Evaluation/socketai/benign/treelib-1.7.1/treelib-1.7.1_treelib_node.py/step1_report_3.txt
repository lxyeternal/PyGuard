  "purpose": "Defines a Node class for managing tree structures with attributes and methods for node identification, hierarchy, and data storage.",
  "sources": "import statements, class methods, and properties that access or modify node attributes, especially those handling identifiers, pointers, and data.",
  "sinks": "Potential data modification in set_predecessor, set_successors, and identifier setter; deprecated properties accessing predecessor/successors; no direct data leak or network activity.",
  "flows": "Identifier assignment or update flows through _set_identifier and set_predecessor; hierarchy management flows via predecessor and successors methods; deprecated properties route through set_predecessor/set_successors.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated properties and methods, but no malicious or suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external communications; no obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a tree node with hierarchy management, identifiers, and data storage. It includes deprecated properties for backward compatibility. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are processed in a malicious manner. No network or file system operations suggest malicious intent. Use of UUID for identifiers and flexible successors/predecessors management is typical. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate tree node class without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a tree node with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It includes deprecated properties for compatibility but does not perform any suspicious or harmful actions. The overall security risk is low.",
