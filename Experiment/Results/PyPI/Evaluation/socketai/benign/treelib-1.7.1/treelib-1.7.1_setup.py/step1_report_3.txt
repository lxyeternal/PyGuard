  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'treelib' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Constants (__version__, package data, and metadata fields such as url, author_email), and the setup() function call which contains static data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not process user input or data streams.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources leading to sinks; all data is statically defined within the code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets beyond version info, or unusual behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static package configuration data for setuptools. No dynamic code execution, input processing, or network activity occurs. The package metadata appears standard and benign. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python library, containing no malicious behavior or security risks.",
