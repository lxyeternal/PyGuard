  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'treelib' Python library.",
  "sources": "Variables (__version__, package data), setup() function parameters (name, version, url, author, author_email, description, long_description, license, packages, keywords, install_requires, include_package_data, package_data, classifiers).",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity. Data flows are straightforward configuration data for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and defines a version string. The setup() function specifies package metadata, dependencies, and data files. All data appears static and consistent with typical package setup procedures. There are no user inputs, environment variable reads, or dynamic code execution points. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign Python setup script for packaging 'treelib'. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration.",
