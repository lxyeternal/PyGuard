  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code is a standard `setup.py` script using `setuptools`.\n   - It defines package metadata: name, version, URL, author info, description, license, dependencies, classifiers, etc.\n   - All data are static, hardcoded, and typical for Python package configuration.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, network operations, or obfuscated patterns.\n   - The version string is \"1.7.1\" — a typical version identifier.\n   - No secrets, credentials, or sensitive data are present.\n\n2. **Security & Malware Analysis**:\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious logic.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, or very close to 0.\n   - The only exception is report 5, which assigns a `securityRisk` of 0.1, but this appears to be an overestimation given the static and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Assessment & Recommendations**:\n   - The code is a textbook example of a setup script for packaging a Python library.\n   - There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors present.\n   - The risk scores should all be 0, reflecting the benign nature.\n   - The malware score should be 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n   - The obfuscated score should be 0, as there's no obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score should be 0, given the lack of any security concern.\n\n**Final Justification**:\n- The code is straightforward, static, and standard.\n- No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- The package appears legitimate and safe.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis from all reports.",
