  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for 'treelib' using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() function: name, version, url, author, author_email, description, long_description, license, packages, keywords, install_requires, include_package_data, package_data, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration without external input.",
  "flows": "N/A - static configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script defining package metadata with static values. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, network activity, or obfuscation. All signals indicate a benign, standard packaging script. No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate. The only exception is one report assigning a securityRisk of 0.1, which is unjustified given the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 for an accurate assessment.",
