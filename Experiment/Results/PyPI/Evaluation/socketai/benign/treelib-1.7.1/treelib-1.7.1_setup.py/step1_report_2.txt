  "purpose": "Define package metadata and setup configuration for the 'treelib' Python package.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function, such as package information, URLs, author details, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no code execution or untrusted data handling points present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is configuration data with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code follows standard Python packaging practices and contains no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and defines package metadata such as name, version, URL, author, description, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no dynamic or user-input-driven elements. The code is a typical setup script used for packaging Python projects. It does not contain any code that reads external input, executes untrusted code, or performs network communication. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely defines package metadata for distribution.",
