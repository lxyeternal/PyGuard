  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, network activity, or data processing from untrusted sources is present.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and typical for package configuration.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The only potential concern is in report 5, which assigns a `securityRisk` score of 0.1. Given the analysis states no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities, this seems overly cautious. A `securityRisk` score should be 0 unless there's a justified reason for concern.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All reports assign `malware` and `obfuscated` scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Risk Scores:**\n- The risk scores are all at or near 0, with report 5 slightly higher at 0.1. Since there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent, a score of 0 is more appropriate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, with no security issues.\n- The scores should reflect this: `malware=0`, `obfuscated=0`, and `securityRisk=0`.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores are consistent with the reports' findings and the code's nature.\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary; the reports are accurate, and the scores should be adjusted to reflect the benign nature of the code.",
