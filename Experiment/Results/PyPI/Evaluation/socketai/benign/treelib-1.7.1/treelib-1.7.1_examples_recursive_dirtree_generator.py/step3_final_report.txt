  "purpose": "Generate a recursive directory tree with random directory and file names for visualization or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Internal functions generating random strings, directory and file name properties, and the recursive build function.",
  "sinks": "In-memory `treelib` tree structure, console output via `tree.show()`.",
  "flows": "Random string generation feeds directory and file names; directory names are hashed with MD5 for node identifiers; recursive calls build the tree structure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns. Use of MD5 for node identifiers is standard in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a directory tree with randomly named directories and files, using standard libraries and no external input or network activity. Node identifiers are MD5 hashes of directory names, which is acceptable for this purpose. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the script as benign, with no security issues. Malware scores are appropriately zero; obfuscation scores are zero; security risk scores are very low (~0.1), justified by the benign nature and standard use of hashing. No evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities is present. The code is suitable for visualization/testing, with minimal security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless directory tree generator for visualization or testing, with no malicious or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications needed.",
