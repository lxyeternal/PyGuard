{
  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator function to mark other functions as deprecated, issuing a warning when they are called.",
  "sources": "The code reads function name and alias parameters when the decorator is applied; it also reads function calls to invoke the wrapper.",
  "sinks": "The warning message generated by warn() may be output to standard error or logs, but it does not cause harm or leak data.",
  "flows": "Input: function name and alias. Flow: When a decorated function is called, the wrapper emits a warning, then calls the original function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code uses standard library features appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'deprecated' which marks functions as deprecated by issuing a warning upon invocation. It uses functools for wrapping functions, warnings for warning emission, and simplefilter to control warning display. The logic is straightforward and adheres to common patterns for deprecation warnings. No data leaks, no malicious code, no obfuscation observed. It is a utility function commonly found in codebases to signal deprecation status.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for marking functions as deprecated. It does not contain malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is negligible.",
