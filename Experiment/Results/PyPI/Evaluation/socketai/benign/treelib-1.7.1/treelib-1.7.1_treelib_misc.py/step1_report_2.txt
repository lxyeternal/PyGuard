{
  "purpose": "This code provides a decorator function to mark other functions as deprecated, issuing warnings when they are called.",
  "sources": "The code reads function calls that are decorated with @deprecated to issue warnings.",
  "sinks": "Warning issuance via the warn() function; no data sinks for untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "Function calls to decorated functions trigger the wrapper, which issues a warning, then proceeds to execute the original function.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard library features for warnings and function decorators. No obfuscated or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a 'deprecated' decorator that issues a deprecation warning whenever the decorated function is called. It manages warning filters carefully, temporarily setting them to 'always' before issuing the warning and resetting afterward. The code only uses standard Python modules (functools and warnings) and standard practices for deprecation warnings. No external inputs, no suspicious or malicious code behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for marking functions as deprecated. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and standard in purpose.",
