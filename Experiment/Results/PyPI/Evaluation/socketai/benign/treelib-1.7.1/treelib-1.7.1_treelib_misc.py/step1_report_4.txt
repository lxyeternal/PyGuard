{
  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator to mark functions as deprecated and issue warnings when they are used.",
  "sources": "The code reads input when functions decorated with 'deprecated' are called, triggering warnings.",
  "sinks": "The decorator outputs warnings via the 'warn' function, which could be viewed as a form of informational output but not harmful.",
  "flows": "When a decorated function is invoked, the warning is emitted, then the original function executes.",
  "anomalies": "The code only issues deprecation warnings; it does not include any suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious operations. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'functools' and 'warnings', defines a 'deprecated' decorator that wraps a function to emit a deprecation warning each time the function is called. It manipulates the warning filter temporarily to ensure the warning is always shown. The logic is straightforward, focused on notifying users of deprecated functions, with no suspicious or malicious activities detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility for deprecating functions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and standard in design, intended solely for warning users about deprecated API usage.",
