{
  "purpose": "Provides a decorator to mark functions as deprecated, issuing a warning when called.",
  "sources": "The decorator issues a warning via the 'warn' function when a decorated function is invoked.",
  "sinks": "The warning message is generated and displayed; no external data or untrusted input is processed.",
  "flows": "Function call -> decorator wrapper -> 'warn' function -> warning emitted",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'simplefilter' to temporarily set warning filters, which is standard but slightly unconventional; no malicious or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a 'deprecated' decorator that emits a DeprecationWarning each time a decorated function is called. It uses 'functools.wraps' to preserve metadata and manipulates warning filters to ensure warnings are always shown. No external inputs, network activity, or data leaks are present. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The warning message clearly indicates the deprecated function and its suggested alias. The code adheres to standard practices and does not introduce security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for issuing deprecation warnings, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
