{
  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator function 'deprecated' that issues a warning when a deprecated function is called, guiding users to use an alternative function.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not present; the code does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write data to external systems or perform any output operations.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows as no input or output operations are implemented.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses 'simplefilter' to temporarily change warning filters, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements a decorator to mark functions as deprecated, issuing warnings upon invocation. It imports 'functools' and 'warnings' modules, defines 'deprecated' to generate a wrapper that emits a DeprecationWarning with custom messages, and resets the warning filter after. There are no data inputs, network activities, or potentially harmful operations. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and lacks any obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a deprecation warning decorator with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It serves a development purpose without engaging in any harmful actions.",
