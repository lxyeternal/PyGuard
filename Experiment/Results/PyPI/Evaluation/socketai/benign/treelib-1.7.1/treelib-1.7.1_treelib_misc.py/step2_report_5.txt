  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a straightforward implementation of a deprecation warning decorator using standard Python modules (`functools` and `warnings`). All reports agree that the code does not contain hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation. The logic is clear and typical for such utility functions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious behavior. No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reports' summaries.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.  \n   - **Security Risk**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely a utility for issuing warnings about deprecated functions, and no malicious or suspicious activity is detected, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted. The current scores of 0 or very close to 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports base their conclusions on the code's actual content, not assumptions. They correctly identify that the code does not perform any suspicious or malicious operations.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis provided.\n\n**Overall Assessment**:  \n- The code is a benign, standard utility function for deprecation warnings.  \n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive issues are present.  \n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \nBased on the comprehensive review, I agree with the existing scores. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis code is safe, non-malicious, and serves a common development purpose.",
