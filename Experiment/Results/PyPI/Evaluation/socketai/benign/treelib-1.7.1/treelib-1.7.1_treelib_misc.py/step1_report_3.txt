  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator function 'deprecated' used to mark functions as deprecated, issuing warnings when they are called.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only operates on function calls within the program.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send data to external systems, perform I/O, or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flow from external sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected. Usage of warnings and functools is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a decorator to issue deprecation warnings for functions, using standard Python warnings and functools for wrapping. It does not include any network activity, file manipulation, or other security-sensitive operations. The implementation is straightforward, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended solely for marking functions as deprecated with appropriate warnings. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
