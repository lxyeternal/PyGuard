  "purpose": "Directory traversal and visualization of folder structure with unique node IDs generated via CRC32 hashes of paths.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directories and filenames read during os.walk() traversal.",
  "sinks": "Console output of directory and file information, in-memory tree structure.",
  "flows": "Filesystem data flows into node creation and print statements; no external data transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; use of CRC32 for IDs is standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard directory traversal, pattern filtering, and tree building using common libraries. It generates node IDs via CRC32 hashes, which is a typical approach for lightweight unique identifiers. No network activity, code obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are present. Debug and profiling flags are optional and benign. The code's behavior aligns with a directory visualization utility, with no indicators of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign directory scanner and visualizer with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The use of CRC32 hashes for node IDs is standard practice and does not imply malicious intent. All reports correctly assess the benign nature, with minor security risk scores reflecting potential fingerprinting but not actual threats.",
