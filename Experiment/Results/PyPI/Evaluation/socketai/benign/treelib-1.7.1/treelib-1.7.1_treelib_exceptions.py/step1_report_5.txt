{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a tree or graph data structure to handle various error conditions.",
  "sources": "The code defines class declarations for exceptions; no external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths, as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. All classes are straightforward exception definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception base class, used for error handling in tree or graph structures. No input reading, no data leaks, no network operations, or any malicious behavior. The class definitions are standard and do not perform any logic or side effects. The code appears to be part of a larger project focused on data structure management, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of standard exception class definitions for error handling in a data structure context. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It appears safe and benign.",
