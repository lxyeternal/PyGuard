  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various errors related to tree structures and node properties",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception declarations",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flows; just class and exception declarations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from standard exception classes, with descriptive docstrings. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or external interactions. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The structure and content are consistent with normal exception class definitions intended for error handling in a tree data structure module.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger system for tree management, and there are no indications of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
