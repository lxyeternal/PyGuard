  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a tree or graph data structure to handle various error conditions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception declarations; no external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, external outputs, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; primarily static class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class declarations intended for use within a larger data structure framework. There are no inputs, network activity, file operations, or dynamic code execution. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious logic. It appears to be standard, harmless Python code defining exception types for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for a tree or graph structure, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It does not perform any actions beyond defining error types.",
