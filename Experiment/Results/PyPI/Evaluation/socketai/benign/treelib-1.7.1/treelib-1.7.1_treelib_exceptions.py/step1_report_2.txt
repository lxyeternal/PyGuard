  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in a tree or node management system.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and docstrings within the code.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "The code does not process external input or pass data to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The classes are standard exception definitions with no behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of class definitions for custom exceptions related to node and tree operations. These classes are straightforward, contain no executable code or logic, and serve as error identifiers. No dynamic execution, data processing, or external interactions are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors. The structure is typical for error handling in object-oriented Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard exception class definitions for a node/tree system. It shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The classes are used for error handling and do not perform any actions beyond their definition.",
