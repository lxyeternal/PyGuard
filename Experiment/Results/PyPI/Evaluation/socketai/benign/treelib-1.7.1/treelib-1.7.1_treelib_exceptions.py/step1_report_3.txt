{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a tree data structure, including error handling for node properties, identifiers, and tree integrity issues.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception declarations, no external data input or output.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potentially malicious operations identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data processing pathways present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions related to tree node properties and structure errors. There are no data inputs, outputs, or runtime logic that could be exploited. The classes are straightforward and serve as error indicators. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activity is present. Overall, the code appears to be a standard set of exception classes used for input validation and error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting only of custom exception classes intended for use in a tree data structure implementation. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
