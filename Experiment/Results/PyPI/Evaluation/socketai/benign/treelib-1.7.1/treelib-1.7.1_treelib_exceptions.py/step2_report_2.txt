  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines multiple custom exception classes, all inheriting either from `Exception` or from other custom exception classes.\n   - The classes are purely declarative, with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n   - The purpose is clearly to facilitate error handling within a larger data structure framework, such as a tree or graph.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation:**\n   - The code contains no obfuscated patterns, suspicious constructs, or hardcoded secrets.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n   - The classes are straightforward, with descriptive docstrings, serving solely as error indicators.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports:**\n   - All five reports consistently conclude that the code is benign, standard, and intended for error handling.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks are identified.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), and the malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0.\n\n4. **Scores Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or risks are evident.\n\n5. **Critical Evaluation:**\n   - The code and reports align well; no inconsistencies or unreasonable scores.\n   - The purpose and structure of the code are typical for error handling in data structures.\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the benign nature.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is transparent and simple.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions for a tree or graph data structure. It does not perform any actions beyond defining error types, and there are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary; the current scoring and analysis are appropriate and justified.",
