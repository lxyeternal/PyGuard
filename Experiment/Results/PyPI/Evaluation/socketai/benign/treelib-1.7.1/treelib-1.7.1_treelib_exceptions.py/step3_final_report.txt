  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in tree or graph data structures.",
  "sources": "Class definitions of exception types; no data input, external interactions, or dynamic code execution.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; static class declarations only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, purely declarative, with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions, serving as error indicators for tree or graph operations. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or malicious patterns. The code is static, clear, and standard, with descriptive docstrings. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores of 0, which are consistent with the code's content. The overall structure and purpose are typical for error handling modules in data structure implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of exception class definitions with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
