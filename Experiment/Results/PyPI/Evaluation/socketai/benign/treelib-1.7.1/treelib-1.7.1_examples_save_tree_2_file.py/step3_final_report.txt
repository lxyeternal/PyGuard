  "purpose": "Create and save a hierarchical family tree structure using the 'treelib' library with static, hardcoded data.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded node definitions within the script",
  "sinks": "File output to 'tree.txt'",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to nodes -> saved directly to file",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static with no external inputs or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Tree object, creates nodes with fixed labels and parent relationships, and saves the tree to a file. There are no external data sources, no user inputs, no network activity, and no obfuscation or malicious code. The logic is simple, and the file output is static. All signals indicate benign behavior, with no security concerns or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, static example of hierarchical data creation with no malicious or security risks. The assigned scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and risk: 0 are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
