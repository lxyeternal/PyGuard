  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as consisting solely of comments, licensing information, and import statements for internal modules (.tree and .node).\n- No executable logic, data processing, user input, network activity, or external data handling is present.\n- The code is described as standard, benign, and typical for a library module.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of code:** The code is only comments and import statements; no malicious or suspicious code, no data flows, no input/output operations.\n- **Malware or malicious behavior:** None detected. The code is purely structural and documentation-related.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent.\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n- All five reports agree on the benign nature of the code, with confidence scores of 1, and all assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0.\n- The reasoning is consistent and sound: no executable code, no suspicious patterns, only standard import statements and licensing comments.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Correctly 0; no security risk.\n\n### Justification:\n- Since there is no executable logic, no data flows, and only benign comments and import statements, the scores reflect a safe, open-source module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n**Based on the provided reports and my analysis:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is purely structural, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The import statements are standard for a library module, and the comments are documentation and licensing info only.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code is safe, benign, and typical for an open-source Python library module.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis is required for other parts of the project.",
