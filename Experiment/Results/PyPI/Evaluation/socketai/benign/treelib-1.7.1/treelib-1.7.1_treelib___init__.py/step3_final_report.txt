  "purpose": "Structural setup for a Python tree data structure library, including licensing and module imports.",
  "sources": "Comments containing licensing and documentation; import statements for internal modules (.tree and .node).",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports modules and contains comments.",
  "anomalies": "None; code consists solely of licensing comments and import statements with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely structural, containing licensing comments, documentation, and import statements for internal modules. There are no executable statements, data processing, user input handling, network activity, or dynamic code segments. The import statements are standard for a Python package's core module. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's benign nature is supported by the absence of any suspicious patterns or behaviors. The reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with full confidence, reflecting the safe and standard structure of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented setup module for a Python tree library. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
