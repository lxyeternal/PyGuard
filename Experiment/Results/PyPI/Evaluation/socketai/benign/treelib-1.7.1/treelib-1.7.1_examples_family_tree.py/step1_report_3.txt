{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates creating and manipulating a family tree structure using the 'treelib' library, including adding, removing, moving nodes, and displaying the tree.",
  "sources": "Reads data from user input via print statements and from the 'treelib' library functions that access or modify tree nodes.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to the console using print; no data is sent over networks or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input data is used within tree manipulation functions; output is generated via print statements; no external data flow or network communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or backdoors detected. The code uses standard library functions for data structure management. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily creates and modifies a simple tree structure representing a family hierarchy using 'treelib'. It performs typical operations such as creating nodes, displaying trees, filtering, moving, and removing nodes. No external inputs or untrusted data sources are involved, nor are there any network operations or system modifications. The code appears benign, serving as an example or test of 'treelib' functionalities. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward demonstration of using 'treelib' to manage a family tree structure. It contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity. It is safe for use.",
