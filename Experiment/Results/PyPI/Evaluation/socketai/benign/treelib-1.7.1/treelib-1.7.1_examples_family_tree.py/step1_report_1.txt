{
  "purpose": "This code demonstrates the creation, manipulation, and display of a family tree using the treelib library for educational or illustrative purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data for family member names and identifiers, and the input from the command line (if any) when run interactively, but does not process external untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs data to the console via print statements and displays tree structures. There are no data sinks involved that process untrusted external data for further use or storage.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal static definitions (family member names and identifiers) through the treelib API functions to output statements; no external untrusted data flows into or out of the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are present. The code uses standard library functions and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The script uses the treelib library to build and manipulate a family tree structure. It performs operations such as creating nodes, showing trees, filtering nodes, subtree extraction, moving nodes, and removing nodes—all within a controlled, static environment. There are no indications of data leaks, malicious commands, network activity, or use of untrusted inputs. The code is purely demonstrative, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign demonstration of using the treelib library to create and manipulate hierarchical data structures. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are evident. It appears to serve educational purposes only.",
