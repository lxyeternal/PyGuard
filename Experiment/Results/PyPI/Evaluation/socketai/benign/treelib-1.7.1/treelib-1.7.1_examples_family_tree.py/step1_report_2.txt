{
  "purpose": "Demonstrate usage of the 'treelib' library to create and manipulate a family tree structure.",
  "sources": "Reads input data include the creation of nodes, subtree operations, and tree manipulations; no external data sources or untrusted input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Print statements and tree display functions output data, but do not handle untrusted input or data leaks; no external communication or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from tree node creation and manipulation functions to output via print and display methods; no untrusted data flows into security-sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Use of standard 'treelib' API for tree operations. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code creates and manipulates a family tree structure using the 'treelib' library, with functions to create, display, modify, and navigate the tree. All operations are straightforward and rely solely on the library's API. No input from external or untrusted sources is processed, and no network operations, file I/O beyond standard output, or sensitive data handling are present. The code performs typical data structure manipulations without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard example of using 'treelib' to manage hierarchical data. No malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The overall security risk is very low.",
