{
  "purpose": "The code demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a family tree using the 'treelib' library, serving as an educational example.",
  "sources": "Static data within functions, such as family member names and identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Console output via print statements and tree display functions; no untrusted input or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Data is created statically; no external data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a family tree with hardcoded nodes, performs various manipulations (subtree extraction, node movement, removal), and outputs the structure. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The library functions used are standard and benign. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static demonstration of 'treelib' usage with no malicious intent or security risks. It poses no threat and is suitable as a safe example.",
