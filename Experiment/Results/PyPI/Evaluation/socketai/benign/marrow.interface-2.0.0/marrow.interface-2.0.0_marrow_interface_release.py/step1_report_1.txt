{
  "purpose": "To define release information, version details, author info, description, and URL for the Marrow Interface package.",
  "sources": "Reading static strings, namedtuple definitions, and attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input/output points or external communication within this code.",
  "flows": "Static data is assigned to variables; no external data flows or user inputs are processed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, no hardcoded credentials beyond author info, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines metadata about a package using static strings and namedtuples. The version info is constructed from a tuple with fixed values, and author info is statically assigned. There are no inputs, external calls, or data manipulations that could lead to vulnerabilities. The URL points to a GitHub repository, which is a common pattern for package metadata. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code only sets static metadata variables with no external data handling or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and serves purely informational purposes.",
