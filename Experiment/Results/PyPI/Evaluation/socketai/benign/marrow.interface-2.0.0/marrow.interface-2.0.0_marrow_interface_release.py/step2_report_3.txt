  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the code itself.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines static package metadata: version info, author, description, URL.\n- Uses `namedtuple` to organize version and author data.\n- Constructs a version string based on fixed values.\n- All data are hardcoded, with no external input, output, or dynamic behavior.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code functions as intended for static metadata. No issues are present in the logic or implementation.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected. The code only assigns static strings and tuples.\n- **External interactions:** None.\n- **Obfuscation or suspicious constructs:** None.\n\n### Review of Reports:\n\nAll five reports consistently conclude that the code is straightforward, static, metadata-only, and safe. They all assign hardcoded strings and tuples, with no external data flows or suspicious logic.\n\n**Errors or flaws in reasoning:**\n- None. All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- They correctly note the absence of obfuscation, external data, or malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n- These are appropriate given the static, metadata-only nature.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**\n- The reports do not identify any issues that would warrant raising the risk or malware scores.\n- The only minor point is the version string construction, which, while slightly unusual, is straightforward and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 is correct; no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate; static metadata poses no security risk.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely informational.\n- No external data handling, no dynamic code, no suspicious patterns.\n- The static data is typical for package metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, static, and serves only as package metadata. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports are accurate in their assessment.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed; the code is benign.",
