  "purpose": "Static package metadata definition including version info, author, description, and URL.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version tuple, author tuple, and string literals.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external data flows.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assigned directly to variables.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static definitions with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static package metadata using standard library constructs (namedtuple, string join). It constructs a version string from fixed data, with no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports correctly identify the code as static, benign, and metadata-only. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's nature. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static metadata module with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports are accurate and consistent. The appropriate scores are malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. No adjustments are necessary.",
