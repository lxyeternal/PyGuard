{
  "purpose": "To define and provide release information about the Marrow Interface package, including version, author, description, and URL.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded values for version info, author details, description, and URL.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sources or data flows that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "None; no data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials beyond typical metadata, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines static package metadata using standard Python constructs such as namedtuples and string operations. The version info is assembled from hardcoded numeric values, and author details are also hardcoded. The description and URL are static strings. There are no inputs, no external data processing, and no potentially dangerous code or logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward package metadata definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no external data sources, sinks, or flows that could be exploited.",
