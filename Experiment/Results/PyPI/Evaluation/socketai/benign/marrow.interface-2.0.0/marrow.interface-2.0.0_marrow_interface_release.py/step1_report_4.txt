  "purpose": "To define release information, versioning, author details, description, and URL for the Marrow Interface package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data such as version info, author details, description, and URL.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that handle untrusted input or data that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code constructs version strings and author data from static data; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The version string construction appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'namedtuple' from collections, defines static version info, constructs a version string, defines author info with static name and email, and sets descriptive variables. All data are static, hardcoded, and relevant to package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. There are no suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security issues present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata definition for package release info with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a straightforward, static information module with no evidence of malware or security concerns.",
