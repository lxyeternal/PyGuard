  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is static, straightforward, and only defines package metadata.\n- No external data sources, user inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- The code uses standard library constructs (namedtuple, string operations) with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- The only potential concern could be the version string construction, but it is a simple conditional concatenation based on static data.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues in the code:\n- The code matches the description: static metadata definitions.\n- No issues or anomalies are detected in the code logic.\n- No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or flaws are present.\n- The version string construction, while slightly unusual in style, is correct and straightforward.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which is consistent with the code's static and benign nature.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n- The `obfuscated` scores are 0, matching the lack of obfuscation.\n- The confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is justified given the clear, static nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for any higher risk scores:\n- Since all evidence points to purely static, benign metadata, there is no reason to assign a risk score above 0.5.\n- The malware score of 0 is correct; no malicious activity is present.\n- The security risk remains 0, as there's no attack surface.\n\n### Potential assumptions or claims:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as non-malicious and straightforward.\n- No assumptions about hidden behavior are justified here.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe code is a simple, static metadata module with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. Given the static nature, lack of external interactions, and standard constructs, I concur with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a security risk score of 0. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep all scores at 0.\n- No further action needed; the code is safe and benign.",
