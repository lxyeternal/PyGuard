  "purpose": "Define release information and metadata for the Marrow Interface package, including version and author details.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments and the creation of namedtuple instances.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no external data handling or output to untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The code initializes version information and author details with static data, with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials beyond author info, which is typical metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version information using namedtuple with fixed values, constructs a version string, and defines author and project URL metadata. All operations involve static data and standard library usage. There are no input sources, network connections, or data leaks present. No obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward metadata initialization for a package, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
