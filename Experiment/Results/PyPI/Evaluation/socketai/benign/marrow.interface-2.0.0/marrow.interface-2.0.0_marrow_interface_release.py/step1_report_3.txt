{
  "purpose": "To define and store release information about the Marrow Interface package, including versioning, author details, description, and URL.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded strings and tuples, and creates namedtuples for version and author information.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent externally or used in a way that could leak or leak untrusted data. No sinks are present that could lead to data leakage or external effects.",
  "flows": "The code initializes data structures with static data; there are no data flows involving untrusted input or external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses an unusual approach to construct the version string, especially the conditional addition based on releaselevel. However, this is straightforward and not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines release metadata such as version, author, description, and URL using static, hardcoded data. It employs namedtuples for organization. The version string is constructed dynamically but from static data. No external data sources, input, or network activity is involved. The code appears to serve a documentation or metadata purpose without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to store and organize package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
