  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with a notable security concern stemming from executing external code via exec(). No malware or obfuscation detected. The primary risk is external code compromise. Scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are zero, security risk is moderate (~0.35). To improve security, replacing exec() with safer import mechanisms is recommended."
