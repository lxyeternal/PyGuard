  "anomalies": [
    "Execution of external release.py file via exec() without validation",
    "Dependence on external file 'release.py' which could contain malicious code",
    "No input validation or sanitization of external scripts",
    "No obfuscation or hidden code patterns"
  ],
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks, importing necessary modules, verifying Python version, executing an external release.py file, and calling setup() with project metadata. The only potential concern is the exec() of release.py, which could be malicious if the file is tampered with, as it executes code dynamically from an external source without validation. The rest of the code appears standard and safe. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a potential risk associated with executing an external Python script (release.py) via exec(). If that file is compromised, it could contain malicious code. Otherwise, the package setup logic itself is benign.",
