{
  "purpose": "Defines classes for attribute, property, and method validation using introspection, primarily for schema enforcement and attribute checks.",
  "sources": "Attribute access via getattr, hasattr; inspect.getfullargspec for function signatures; class and instance attribute dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or system modifications; validation occurs internally within the classes.",
  "flows": "Source data (attributes, method signatures) flows through validation checks in __call__ and check methods, with no external data or system effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external communication. Use of inspect is standard for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of validation classes leveraging Python's inspect module to verify attributes, methods, and properties. It performs introspection and validation without external data, network activity, or system modifications. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The logic is straightforward, focusing on attribute existence, type checks, and method signature validation. The use of inspect.getfullargspec is standard for such purposes. Overall, the code is a legitimate validation utility with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard schema validation framework utilizing introspection. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of approximately 0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
