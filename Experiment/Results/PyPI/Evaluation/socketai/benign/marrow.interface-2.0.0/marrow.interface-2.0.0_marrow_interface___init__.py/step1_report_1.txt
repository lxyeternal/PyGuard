{
  "purpose": "Importing Interface from meta module and version from release module, likely for package metadata or initialization.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .meta and .release",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs observed; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "Imports are static and do not involve data flow from untrusted sources; no runtime data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules. It imports an Interface class or object from a module named meta and a version string or object from a release module. No dynamic execution, data manipulation, network activity, or other potentially malicious behavior is present. The code appears to serve a standard purpose of module setup or metadata declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, performing straightforward imports without any malicious intent or security risks. It is typical for Python package initialization files.",
