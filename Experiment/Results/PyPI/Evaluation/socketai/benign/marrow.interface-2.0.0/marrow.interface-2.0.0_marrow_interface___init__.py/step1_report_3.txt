{
  "purpose": "Importing classes and variables from local modules for internal use within the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from .meta and .release modules, specifically 'Interface' and '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imported data ('Interface' and '__version__') are likely used elsewhere in the package; no direct flow in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected. Imports are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard module imports: it imports the 'Interface' class or object from the local '.meta' module and the 'version' variable from the '.release' module, renaming it as '__version__'. These are typical in Python packages to access internal metadata or interfaces. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is present. Since the code is minimal and only involves standard imports, there is no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement for internal modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be boilerplate package code for internal data access.",
