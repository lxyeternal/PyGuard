{
  "purpose": "The code imports internal modules 'meta' and 'release' to expose 'Interface' and '__version__' attributes, likely for package metadata or interface exposure.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from local modules (.meta and .release).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data manipulation present.",
  "flows": "Import statements load static attributes; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, static, and typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two static import statements from local modules, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data handling. The imports are standard for exposing package metadata or interfaces. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring accurately reflects this. No adjustments are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
