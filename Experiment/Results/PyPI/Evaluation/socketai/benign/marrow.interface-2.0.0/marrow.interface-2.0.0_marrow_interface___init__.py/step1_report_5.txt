  "purpose": "The code imports classes and variables from local modules, likely to define or utilize interfaces and version information within a larger package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local module files (.meta and .release).",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or exported that could lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The code imports data from internal modules; no external data flow or processing occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to be straightforward import statements.",
  "analysis": "This code performs simple import operations from internal modules, importing a class 'Interface' and a version string '__version__'. There are no dynamic code execution, external network calls, or sensitive data handling. The code structure is standard and does not raise suspicion. Given its minimal and straightforward nature, no malicious behavior or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is benign, consisting of basic import statements for internal module components. It does not contain malicious behavior or security issues.",
