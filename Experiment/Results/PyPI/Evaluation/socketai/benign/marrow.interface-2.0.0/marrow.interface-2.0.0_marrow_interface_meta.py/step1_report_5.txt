{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom metaclass InterfaceMeta for schema validation and interface enforcement, along with an Interface class singleton.",
  "sources": "Imports from inspect, marrow.schema.meta, and local schema module; class and method definitions; attribute access and type checks.",
  "sinks": "Uses getattr for dynamic attribute access; calls isinstance, issubclass, and type checks; no direct data output or external network calls.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as class attributes and instance checks flow through __instancecheck__ and implements method, influencing behavior based on attribute types and class inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. The code enforces type restrictions for interface attributes, which is a normal pattern. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a metaclass that enforces constraints on class attributes, ensuring they are of type Attribute and that only certain properties are present. It overrides __instancecheck__ to customize isinstance behavior. The use of getattr and isinstance/issubclass checks is standard and safe. No external network, file operations, or data exfiltration present. The code appears to implement schema validation logic with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured implementation of a custom metaclass for schema validation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It strictly enforces attribute types and class inheritance patterns without external interactions.",
