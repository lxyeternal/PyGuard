{
  "purpose": "Enforces interface-like constraints using a custom metaclass, ensuring that interface classes only contain Attribute instances and supporting runtime checks for interface implementation.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions within classes using InterfaceMeta, particularly attributes assigned as Attribute instances; class inheritance checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network operations, or data leaks are present; no sinks that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Class creation flow where attribute definitions are validated; runtime checks in implements() method verifying object support for interfaces via attribute callables and class inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard Python introspection and no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a metaclass that enforces interface constraints by restricting class attributes to Attribute instances and ensuring bases are only other InterfaceMeta classes. The implements method checks if an object supports an interface via class inheritance and attribute callables. No external data flows, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The code is a standard pattern for interface enforcement, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of an interface enforcement system using Python metaclasses. All reports' scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
