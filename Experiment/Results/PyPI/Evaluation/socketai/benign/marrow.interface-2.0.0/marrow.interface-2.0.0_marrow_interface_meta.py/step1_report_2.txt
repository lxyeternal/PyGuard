{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom metaclass for interface-like behavior, restricting attributes and controlling instance checks.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'inspect', 'marrow.schema.meta', and local '.schema'; class definitions and method implementations.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data sources or network I/O present.",
  "flows": "No external data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mostly class and method definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed. The code strictly enforces attribute types and base class constraints.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom metaclass 'InterfaceMeta' that enforces attribute type restrictions and interface-like behaviors. It restricts attributes to 'Attribute' instances and ensures bases are only 'InterfaceMeta'. The methods 'implements' and '__instancecheck__' provide interface compliance checks based on class or instance attributes. The code appears to be standard Python metaclass code with no malicious behavior, external data handling, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a metaclass for interface enforcement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
