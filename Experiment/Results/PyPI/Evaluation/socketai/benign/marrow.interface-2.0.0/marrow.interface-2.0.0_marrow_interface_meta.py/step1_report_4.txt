{
  "purpose": "Define a custom metaclass `InterfaceMeta` for interface-like behavior with restrictions on attributes and instance checks.",
  "sources": "Code reads class attributes, method parameters, and calls functions like `getattr` and `isinstance`.",
  "sinks": "Uses `getattr` on `interface` and `instance`, `issubclass` and `isinstance` checks, and attribute access within `implements` method.",
  "flows": "Attribute checks and method calls (e.g., `getattr`, `issubclass`, `isinstance`) operate on passed objects, with some dynamic behavior in `implements`.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or suspicious dynamic code execution. The code performs type checks and attribute validations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a metaclass for interface enforcement, including attribute validation and custom `isinstance` behavior. It uses standard Python introspection functions like `getattr`, `issubclass`, and `isinstance`. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The `implements` method checks assumptions via class hierarchy or tuple of types, and applies attribute-based validation. Overall, the code appears to be a structured, purpose-driven implementation of interface validation with no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a custom metaclass for interface-like validation, enforcing attribute types and instance checks without any malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as intended for a schema validation purpose, with no signs of malware or security threats.",
