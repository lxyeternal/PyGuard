{
  "purpose": "Define a custom metaclass 'InterfaceMeta' for creating interface-like classes with restrictions and support for runtime checks.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'inspect', 'marrow.schema.meta', and local module 'schema'. Definitions of '__all__', 'ALLOWED_PROPERTIES', and class methods within 'InterfaceMeta'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, none directly from this code. No untrusted input handling or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The 'implements' method checks if an object supports the interface by inspecting class attributes and assumptions, but no external data flow or network operations are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The code uses standard class and metaclass mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a metaclass that enforces constraints on class attributes to ensure they only contain 'Attribute' instances, and that interfaces do not mix with other base classes. The 'implements' method performs type checks and attribute-based interface conformance checks. There are no external data inputs, network interactions, or malicious constructs. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of an interface-like pattern using Python metaclasses.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an interface system with restrictions, without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not perform any network, file, or system operations, nor does it contain hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. Overall, it poses no security risks.",
