{
  "purpose": "The code defines test cases for schema objects and interfaces, primarily for validating the behavior of the 'marrow.interface' module.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'marrow.interface' and 'schema' attributes within classes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "N/A - No untrusted data flow or data processing that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code mainly performs assertions for testing class behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs class definitions and test assertions related to interface creation, subclassing, and attribute handling. It uses standard Python features and the 'marrow.interface' library to define interfaces and attributes. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The structure and content appear to be standard unit test code for a schema library, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite for a schema/interface library, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs interface validation and attribute assertions without any harmful behavior.",
