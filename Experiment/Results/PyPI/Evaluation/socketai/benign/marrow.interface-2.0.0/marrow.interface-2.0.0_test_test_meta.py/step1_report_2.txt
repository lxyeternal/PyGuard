  "purpose": "Test suite for schema objects and interface classes from marrow.interface module.",
  "sources": "Imports marrow.interface modules, defines classes, and runs assertions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external systems; no network, file, or environment interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines test classes and methods for interface validation, subclassing, and attribute handling. It uses standard Python features and the marrow.interface library without any code execution of untrusted input, network operations, or file manipulations. The imports and class definitions are typical for test code. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard test suite for a Python interface library with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns.",
