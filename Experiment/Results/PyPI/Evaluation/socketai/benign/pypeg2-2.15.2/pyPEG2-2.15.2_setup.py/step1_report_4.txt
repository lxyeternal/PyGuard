{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup script for packaging a Python project named 'pyPEG2'.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'README.txt' for long_description, environment variables or external inputs are not directly read, only static strings and the content of a local file.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'open' to read a local file, but does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.txt' content into 'long_description'. No untrusted data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'distutils.core' which is deprecated; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or malicious code present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a typical package setup, importing 'distutils.core', setting version and package metadata, and reading a local README file. No external data input, no code injection, or suspicious behavior. No signs of malware or malicious intent. The code appears standard for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. It only reads a local file and defines package metadata.",
