{
  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the pyPEG2 Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.txt' file for the long description, imports package metadata, and defines package distribution details.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data leaks or security-critical operations detected.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.txt' -> assigns metadata variables -> calls setup() with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools', which is outdated but not malicious; reads an external README file directly, which could be manipulated if the file is compromised, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup operation, defining package metadata and dependencies. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are processed at runtime. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. Use of 'open' to read 'README.txt' is common but could be problematic if the file is maliciously altered outside of this script's context, though this is not malicious by itself. No malicious code injection, network activity, or secret handling detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs standard package configuration tasks without any suspicious behaviors.",
