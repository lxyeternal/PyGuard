  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the pyPEG2 Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.txt file, hardcoded package metadata, and version string.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow involving untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of distutils.core.setup (deprecated in favor of setuptools), but no malicious behavior observed. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package setup script specifying package metadata and dependencies. It reads a local file ('README.txt') for the long description, which is typical but could be problematic if the file contents are malicious or tampered with, though unlikely to be malicious code. The code does not perform any network operations, code execution, or handle untrusted input. No obfuscated code, no suspicious logic, and no indicators of malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It uses standard Python packaging practices with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
