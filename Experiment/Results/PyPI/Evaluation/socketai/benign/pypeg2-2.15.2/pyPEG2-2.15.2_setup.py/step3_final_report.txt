  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for pyPEG2, defining metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.txt' for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no network activity or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated 'distutils.core' instead of 'setuptools'; reads external file without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script that defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It reads a local README file for description, which is common practice. No user input, environment variables, or network activity are present. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious logic is detected. The only minor concern is reading an external file without validation, but this is standard in setup scripts and not malicious. The use of 'distutils.core' is outdated but not malicious. Overall, the script is benign and aligns with all reports' assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. Minor concerns about external file reading are standard and do not indicate malicious behavior.",
