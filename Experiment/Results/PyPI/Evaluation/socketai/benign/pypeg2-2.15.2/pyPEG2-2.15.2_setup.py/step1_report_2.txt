{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up and distributing a Python package named 'pyPEG2'.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from the script variables, reads the 'README.txt' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output channels that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Uses static data for package configuration; no flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'distutils.core.setup' which is standard but less secure than 'setuptools'; reads 'README.txt' without validation, but this is typical. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script defines package metadata for distribution, including package names, author info, URLs, and dependencies. It reads the README file content dynamically but in a safe manner. No external input processing, no code injection points, and no network operations or malicious commands observed. The code appears to be a standard setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard configuration tasks for Python package distribution without any suspicious or harmful code.",
