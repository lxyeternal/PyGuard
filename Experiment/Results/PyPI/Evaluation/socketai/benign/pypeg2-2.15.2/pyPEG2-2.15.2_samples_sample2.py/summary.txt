  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured INI parser with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The static data and standard library usage confirm its safety. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
