{
  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code content, data sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, and overall security posture.",
  "sources": "Input points such as environment variables, user input, file reads, network requests, or subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or security impacts through network transmission, file modification, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Paths from data sources to sinks, including any processing or dynamic execution that could lead to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious behaviors like network communication with suspicious domains.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate either absence of code or benign code with no suspicious patterns. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, justified by the lack of evidence. Risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting cautious acknowledgment of potential but unconfirmed risks. Confidence levels vary appropriately based on detail provided. The reasoning in each report aligns with the evidence, and the scores are consistent and reasonable.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign across all reports, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk scores are appropriate given the limited but non-suspicious context. No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are accurate and conservative.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
