  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Content and Purpose of the Code:**\n   - The code defines a set of deprecated classes and data structures for AWS API Gateway v2 integrations, primarily used within the AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) in Python.\n   - These classes include integrations with load balancers, Lambda functions, service discovery, WebSocket, and URL proxies.\n   - The code is purely declarative, meant for infrastructure configuration, with constructors, properties, and data types.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - No runtime data flows, external data reading, or dynamic code execution are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - The use of deprecated annotations indicates legacy or outdated APIs, not malicious intent.\n   - The code consists of class definitions, property setters/getters, and data structures, typical for SDKs or infrastructure-as-code libraries.\n\n3. **Analysis of Risks:**\n   - The code is strictly for configuration, with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n   - No network operations, external calls, or code injection points.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is boilerplate for AWS resource configuration, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or data leaks.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior detected)\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n   - **Risk Score:** Given the purely declarative, deprecated SDK code with no runtime or external data handling, a low risk score of around 0.1 is appropriate. The deprecation status suggests these are legacy APIs, not actively malicious.\n\n5. **Errors or Logical Flaws in Reports:**\n   - Reports 2 and 4/5 are empty or contain no analysis; they provide no additional insight.\n   - The first and third reports are consistent, thorough, and align with the code's nature.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The overall assessment from the reports is accurate: the code is benign, deprecated SDK/configuration code for AWS CDK.\n   - No adjustments needed for scores; they are appropriate given the content.\n\n**Final Personal Estimation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (due to deprecation, not maliciousness)\n\nThis code is safe, legacy infrastructure configuration, with no security risks or malicious intent detected.",
