{
  "purpose": "The code defines deprecated classes and data structures for AWS API Gateway v2 integrations within the AWS CDK, used for configuring infrastructure resources such as load balancers, Lambda functions, and service discovery endpoints. It serves as boilerplate for legacy infrastructure setup.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, property setters/getters, and data type definitions that initialize configuration objects and parameters.",
  "sinks": "No runtime data flows, external data reads, or dynamic code execution points are present. The code is purely declarative for infrastructure setup.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted input or external calls; the code only sets properties and defines data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are detected. The use of deprecated annotations indicates legacy API support, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions, properties, and data types for AWS CDK integrations, all marked as deprecated. It contains no runtime logic, external data handling, or dynamic execution. The absence of network operations, secrets, or obfuscation indicates benign configuration code. The deprecation tags suggest legacy support, not malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate given the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, legacy infrastructure configuration code for AWS CDK with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The low risk score reflects deprecation warnings but not malicious intent. The assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
