  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Purpose & Content**: The code defines deprecated classes and data structures for AWS API Gateway v2 integrations in the AWS CDK, primarily for setting up integrations with load balancers, Lambda functions, and service discovery.\n   - **Data & Flows**: All classes are constructors, property setters/getters, and data types; no runtime data processing, external data reading, or dynamic code execution.\n   - **Malicious Indicators**: No hardcoded credentials, secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The use of deprecated tags indicates legacy API support, not malicious intent.\n   - **Conclusion**: The code is purely declarative, for infrastructure configuration, with no security risks or malware detected.\n   - **Scores**: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low, due to deprecation warnings but not malicious). This seems reasonable.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Content**: No information provided (\"Empty response\"). Cannot analyze.\n   - **Scores**: No basis for any assessment.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Purpose & Content**: Similar to Report 1, defining deprecated classes and data structures for AWS CDK integrations. No runtime logic or external data handling.\n   - **Data & Flows**: Same as above—declarative class definitions, no malicious behavior.\n   - **Malicious Indicators**: None. Deprecated status suggests legacy support, not malicious activity.\n   - **Conclusion**: No malicious behavior or security risk. The code is standard SDK/construct boilerplate.\n   - **Scores**: Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0. This aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Overall Justification & Recommendations**:\n- The code is legacy infrastructure configuration code, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- The deprecation annotations do not imply malicious intent but indicate these are outdated APIs.\n- The risk score of 0.1 in Report 1 is acceptable; it reflects deprecation warnings but not a security concern.\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is correct, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- Obfuscation scores are 0, consistent with the readable, declarative nature of the code.\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies or security threats.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 (deprecation warning, not a security risk)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a set of deprecated, configuration-only classes for AWS CDK integrations. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores given are reasonable and should remain as is.",
