{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up and load a JSII assembly for AWS CDK AWS API Gateway v2 integrations, likely for infrastructure as code purposes.",
  "sources": "The code sources include standard Python modules (abc, builtins, datetime, enum, typing), third-party modules (jsii, publication, typing_extensions, check_type), and AWS CDK modules (aws_cdk, aws_cdk.aws_apigatewayv2_alpha, constructs). It also loads a JSII assembly file (.tgz).",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to have explicit sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No external network connections, file writes, or command executions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no evident source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input or data manipulation that could lead to security issues.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns are observed. The code primarily performs static imports and loads a JSII assembly without any malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports several standard and third-party modules, then loads a specific JSII assembly for AWS CDK integrations, and finally publishes the module. All actions are consistent with infrastructure code setup. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage are present. The code lacks dynamic execution, external command calls, or network activity. It appears to be a standard setup script for a CDK construct.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for AWS CDK modules using JSII. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It performs static imports and loads a package resource without any suspicious activity.",
