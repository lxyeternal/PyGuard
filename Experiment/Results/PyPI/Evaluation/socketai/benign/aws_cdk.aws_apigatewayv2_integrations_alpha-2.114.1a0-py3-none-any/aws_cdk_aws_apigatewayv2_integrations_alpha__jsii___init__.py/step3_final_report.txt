  "purpose": "Setup script for an AWS CDK module related to API Gateway v2 integrations, loading a JSII assembly and publishing metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements, jsii assembly load from tgz archive, publication.publish() call",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, no network activity, no dynamic code execution",
  "flows": "Assembly load and publish are static operations; no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static setup code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard infrastructure setup script for AWS CDK, performing module imports, loading a JSII assembly from a package archive, and publishing metadata. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The assembly load and publish functions are typical in CDK modules. No external data, network activity, or dynamic execution is observed. The code is static and adheres to best practices for such modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for AWS CDK infrastructure modules, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is appropriately low (0). The reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
