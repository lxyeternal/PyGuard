  "purpose": "Defines a data model 'ResultType' for quantum task results, facilitating JSON parsing and validation.",
  "sources": "JSON input string representing result type attributes.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Parsing JSON into ResultType object; no external data flow or execution.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Pydantic data model with optional attributes, no dynamic code, external calls, or secrets. It includes an example usage and proper documentation. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose is clear, and it functions solely as a schema validator. The absence of network activity, code execution, or data leaks indicates no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data model with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, all consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
