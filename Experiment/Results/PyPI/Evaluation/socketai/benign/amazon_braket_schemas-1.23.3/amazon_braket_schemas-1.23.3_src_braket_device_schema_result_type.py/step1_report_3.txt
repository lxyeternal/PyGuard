  "purpose": "Define a data model for quantum task result types using Pydantic for validation.",
  "sources": "Input JSON parsing via ResultType.parse_raw() method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON input to validated ResultType object, with no external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward data validation with clear structure and no hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Pydantic for data validation, defines a class ResultType with attributes, and provides an example usage. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no external data handling beyond JSON parsing. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, well-structured data model definition for quantum result types, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
