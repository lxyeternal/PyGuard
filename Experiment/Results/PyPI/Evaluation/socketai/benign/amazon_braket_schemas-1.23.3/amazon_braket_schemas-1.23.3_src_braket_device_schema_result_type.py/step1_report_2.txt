{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for representing the result type of a quantum task, including attributes like name, observables, and shot limits.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources; it is solely a class definition.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flows from source to sink in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and uses standard Python and Pydantic practices. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'Optional' type from 'typing' and 'BaseModel' from 'pydantic.v1' to define a class 'ResultType'. The class specifies several attributes related to quantum task results, with appropriate type annotations. The docstring provides detailed documentation and an example usage. No external inputs, outputs, or executable code are present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, standard data model class with no malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a schema for quantum task results, with no suspicious or harmful code.",
