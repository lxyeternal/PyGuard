{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for representing the result type of a quantum task, including attributes such as name, observables, minShots, and maxShots.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines a class and imports, without reading external input at runtime.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data output occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "None; the class definition does not include data flow or runtime execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard use of Pydantic for data modeling, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Optional' and 'BaseModel' from 'pydantic', then defines a class 'ResultType' extending 'BaseModel'. It includes docstrings explaining its purpose and an example. There are no dynamic executions, input handling, or external interactions. The class simply models data with optional fields. No obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data model definition using Pydantic, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not process or handle untrusted data at runtime, and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
