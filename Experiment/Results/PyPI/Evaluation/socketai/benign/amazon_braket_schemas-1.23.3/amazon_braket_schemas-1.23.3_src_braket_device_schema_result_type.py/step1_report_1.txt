{
  "purpose": "Define a data model for representing quantum task result types, including attributes like name, observables, and shot limits.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from JSON input when parsing instances of ResultType via parse_raw.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; the code only models data without executing or transmitting it.",
  "flows": "Input JSON data flows through parse_raw into the ResultType model, but there are no unsafe or malicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a data validation library, defines a class with attributes and documentation, and provides an example of parsing JSON data into this model. It performs standard data modeling with no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and utilizes common libraries without any dynamic code execution or external network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data model definition with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe and follows typical practices for data validation.",
