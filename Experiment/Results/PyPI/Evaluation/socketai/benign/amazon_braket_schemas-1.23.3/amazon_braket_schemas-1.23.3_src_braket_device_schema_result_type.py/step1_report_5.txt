  "purpose": "Define a data model for quantum task result types using Pydantic for validation.",
  "sources": "Input JSON data for parsing into ResultType object.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted in the code.",
  "flows": "Input JSON data -> parse_raw() method -> ResultType object",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; code is straightforward data model definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Pydantic library for data validation, defines a simple data class with optional fields, and includes an example docstring demonstrating usage. There are no dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-documented data model definition with no malicious behavior. It simply validates structured input data related to quantum result types.",
