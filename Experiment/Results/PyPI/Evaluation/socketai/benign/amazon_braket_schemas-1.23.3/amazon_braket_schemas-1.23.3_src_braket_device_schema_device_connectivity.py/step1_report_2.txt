{
  "purpose": "Defines a Pydantic schema for device connectivity properties related to quantum qubits, including attributes for connectivity state and graph details.",
  "sources": "Imports from pydantic.v1, JSON input in example code",
  "sinks": "None present; no data being processed from external sources or untrusted input flows into sensitive operations",
  "flows": "Input JSON parsed by DeviceConnectivity.parse_raw(), but this is just a data validation method without executing untrusted code",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are present; the code is straightforward data schema definition",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard data validation library (pydantic), defines a simple data model with boolean and dictionary attributes, and provides an example of usage. No external data processing, no network communication, and no dynamic code execution. The schema appears purely for data validation purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data schema definition with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a benign utility for data validation within a larger application.",
