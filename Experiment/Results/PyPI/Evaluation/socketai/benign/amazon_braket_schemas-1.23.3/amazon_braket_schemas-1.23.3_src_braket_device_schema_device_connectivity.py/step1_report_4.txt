{
  "purpose": "Defines a data schema for device connectivity properties related to qubits in a quantum computing context.",
  "sources": "Input JSON data parsed by DeviceConnectivity.parse_raw method.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data is transmitted or written elsewhere within the code.",
  "flows": "Input JSON data -> parse_raw method -> DeviceConnectivity object instantiation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual code behavior. The code is straightforward data schema definition with standard type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard data validation library (pydantic) and defines a model with two fields: 'fullyConnected' (boolean) and 'connectivityGraph' (dictionary with string keys and list of strings as values). The class includes a docstring with usage example. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The logic is simple and adheres to typical data modeling practices. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data schema definition for a quantum device connectivity configuration. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. It is a straightforward implementation intended for data validation purposes.",
