{
  "purpose": "Define a schema for device connectivity properties in a quantum computing context, using Pydantic for data validation.",
  "sources": "Input JSON data provided to the parse_raw method for validation.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is directly written to external systems or sensitive locations.",
  "flows": "Input JSON -> parse_raw method -> schema validation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Pydantic BaseModel, defines a data schema with two attributes: 'fullyConnected' (a boolean) and 'connectivityGraph' (a dictionary with string keys and list of strings as values). It includes comprehensive docstrings and example usage. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is standard data validation logic for a configuration schema, with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign data schema definition with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply validates input JSON against a defined structure.",
