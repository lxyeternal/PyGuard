{
  "purpose": "Define a schema for device connectivity properties related to qubits in a quantum computing context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from JSON input used to instantiate the DeviceConnectivity model.",
  "sinks": "Data from untrusted sources could be parsed into the model; however, there are no direct sinks that execute or transmit data beyond parsing.",
  "flows": "Input JSON data flows into the parse_raw method, which converts it into a DeviceConnectivity object.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns are present. Usage of pydantic for data validation is standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a well-known validation library (pydantic), defines a straightforward data model with two attributes, and includes example usage. No code execution, network operations, or security-sensitive functions are present. The schema is purely declarative for data validation without any malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a standard data validation schema for device connectivity parameters. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The implementation appears clean, safe, and intended solely for data modeling.",
