  "purpose": "Defines a data schema for device connectivity in quantum computing, specifying whether the device is fully connected and its connectivity graph.",
  "sources": "Input JSON data parsed via parse_raw into the DeviceConnectivity model.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only validates data without executing or transmitting it.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON input into the schema validation; no further processing or external interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with clear attributes and documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Pydantic model with two attributes: a boolean and a dictionary, used for data validation. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscated patterns. The example usage is standard. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present. The code's simplicity and clarity support a benign assessment. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature. The confidence score is high (1) due to the straightforwardness and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data schema with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
