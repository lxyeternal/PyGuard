{
  "purpose": "Defines parameters for gate model devices in a quantum computing framework, serving as a data schema for validation and configuration.",
  "sources": "Schema class attributes, including 'qubitCount' and 'disableQubitRewiring', and the schema header constant.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; schema validation occurs locally without external data processing or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input JSON parsed into the schema object, validating 'qubitCount' and 'disableQubitRewiring' attributes; no external data flow or malicious data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, network calls, or dynamic execution; straightforward schema definition.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Pydantic schema class defining device parameters with validation constraints. It includes a schema header and example usage. No dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logic is simple, with attributes 'qubitCount' (non-negative integer) and 'disableQubitRewiring' (boolean). No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code's purpose is purely data validation, and it adheres to best practices. All signals indicate benign, secure code with no malicious or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured schema definition for quantum device parameters. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The existing scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are accurate and justified.",
