  "purpose": "Define parameters for gate model devices in a quantum computing framework, including qubit count and rewiring options.",
  "sources": "Input JSON data parsed via 'parse_raw_schema' method (not shown explicitly in the code).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data processing or output; the code mainly defines a data schema.",
  "flows": "Data flow from JSON input to schema parsing via 'parse_raw_schema' (implied in example).",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code adheres to standard data schema definition practices. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data schema class using Pydantic and a custom schema header. It includes a typical example for usage. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or network activity is present. The example shows safe usage of schema parsing with no external dependencies involved in data handling. The overall structure and imports are standard for schema definitions in Python. No suspicious or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward schema definition for quantum device parameters. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard implementation.",
