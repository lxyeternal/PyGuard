  "purpose": "Define parameters for gate model devices in a quantum computing SDK schema.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pydantic and braket.schema_common modules; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; schema parsing is standard.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON input to schema validation through parse_raw_schema method (not shown), but schema attributes are defined for safe usage.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; standard schema class with no unusual code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data schema class using pydantic, with attributes for quantum device parameters. It uses standard data validation with no dynamic execution, no external input handling beyond typical schema parsing, and no suspicious behavior. The code is well-structured and adheres to normal patterns for schema definition. No embedded or obfuscated code, no backdoors, and no suspicious API calls are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward schema definition for quantum device parameters with no malicious intent or security issues.",
