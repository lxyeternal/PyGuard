  "purpose": "Define parameters for gate model devices, including qubit count and rewiring options.",
  "sources": "Input JSON data via the 'parse_raw_schema' method (example in docstring).",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or output operations observed; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input JSON into the 'parse_raw_schema' method to populate schema attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs detected. Code structure is standard schema definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports validation libraries, defines a schema class with attributes, includes an example usage, and sets up schema constants. There are no signs of malicious logic, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The functionality appears to be standard data schema definition for device parameters, with input validation. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward schema definition for device parameters, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
