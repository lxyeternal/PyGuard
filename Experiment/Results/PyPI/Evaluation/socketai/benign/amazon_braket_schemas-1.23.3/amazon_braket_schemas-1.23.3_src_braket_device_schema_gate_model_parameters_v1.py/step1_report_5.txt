  "purpose": "Define parameters for gate model devices in a quantum computing framework using pydantic schema validation.",
  "sources": "The input JSON data to be parsed via 'parse_raw_schema' method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or security-sensitive actions are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Input JSON data flows into 'parse_raw_schema', but this method is not implemented here; the class simply defines a schema.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code is straightforward schema definition.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a class with schema attributes, and includes an example usage. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive operations are present. It is a standard schema class for validating parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign schema definition for quantum device parameters. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
