  "purpose": "Import statements for AWS Braket device schema classes, used for defining quantum device properties and actions.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from the 'braket.device_schema' package, no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data, nor does it handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only imports modules without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with license headers and static imports, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments and import statements from a reputable SDK. No dynamic execution, data handling, or external inputs are present. The import statements are standard for SDK modules, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The consistent high confidence and zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module importing schema classes from the AWS Braket SDK. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
