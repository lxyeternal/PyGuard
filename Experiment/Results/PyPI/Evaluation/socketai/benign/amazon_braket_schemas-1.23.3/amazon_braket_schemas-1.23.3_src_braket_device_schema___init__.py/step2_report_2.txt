  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from the 'braket.device_schema' package.\n- They consistently note the absence of dynamic code, data processing, external inputs, or suspicious patterns.\n- The license header indicates open-source licensing, with no indication of malicious intent.\n- The code appears to be a standard module setup for a quantum SDK, specifically AWS Braket.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n### 1. **Issue presence:**\n- The code contains only import statements and license comments.\n- No functionality, data flows, or external inputs are present.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues or vulnerabilities are present in this code snippet.\n\n### 2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n- The reasoning is sound, emphasizing the absence of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n### 3. **Scores given to each issue:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or 1 with high confidence.\n- Given the benign nature, these scores are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### 4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5.\n- The code is purely import statements with no suspicious activity.\n- **No justification needed for higher scores.**\n\n### 5. **Malware score:**\n- All reports correctly assign malware score as 0.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious payloads.\n\n### 6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All claims are cautious and based on observable facts.\n- No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n\n### 7. **Score consistency:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n- The high confidence and zero malware/security risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Based on the code snippet and reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Rationale:**\n- The code is a straightforward import module, standard in SDKs.\n- No dynamic behavior, external inputs, or suspicious patterns.\n- The license and import statements are typical and benign.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Estimated Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                       | No malicious behavior or payloads present.                                   |\n| Obfuscated        | 0                       | Clear, straightforward import statements with no obfuscation.               |\n| Security Risk     | 0                       | No vulnerabilities, secrets, or risky behavior detected.                   |\n\n**Overall, this code is benign and poses no security threat.**",
