  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of straightforward import statements from the 'braket.device_schema' package.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or external inputs are present.\n- The license header is standard and does not suggest malicious intent.\n- The imports are from a reputable SDK related to quantum device schemas, with no signs of obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with benign import statements.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty that the code is safe.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does **not** contain any malware, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code.\n- The logic is purely import statements, which are standard and safe.\n- No data flows, sinks, or sources involving untrusted data are evident.\n- The license and code structure are typical for SDK modules.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable; no changes needed.\n- Since the code is only import statements, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n**My assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\nThis code is a benign, standard module importing schema classes from a reputable SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- The code is safe and should not be flagged for security concerns.",
