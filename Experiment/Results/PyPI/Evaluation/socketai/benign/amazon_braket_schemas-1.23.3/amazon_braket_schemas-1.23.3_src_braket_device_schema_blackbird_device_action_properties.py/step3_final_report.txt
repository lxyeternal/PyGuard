{
  "purpose": "Defines a schema for Blackbird IR device action properties, specifying supported operations and result types with validation constraints.",
  "sources": "Input JSON data parsed via parse_raw method, validation on 'actionType', 'supportedOperations', and 'supportedResultTypes'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only validates data structures without executing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "Input JSON -> parse_raw -> validation of 'actionType' and list constraints -> data stored in class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "The 'supportedResultTypes' list is constrained with max_items=0, disallowing any entries, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Pydantic schema class with validation rules. No dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The only anomaly is the 'max_items=0' constraint on 'supportedResultTypes', which enforces an empty list. This could be a configuration mistake or intentional restriction but does not introduce security vulnerabilities. The code does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. The malware score is correctly 0, and the low security risk score (around 0.1) is justified by the unusual constraint but not a security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured schema definition with no malicious intent or security issues. The only notable aspect is the 'max_items=0' constraint, which likely is a logical or configuration error but does not pose security risks.",
