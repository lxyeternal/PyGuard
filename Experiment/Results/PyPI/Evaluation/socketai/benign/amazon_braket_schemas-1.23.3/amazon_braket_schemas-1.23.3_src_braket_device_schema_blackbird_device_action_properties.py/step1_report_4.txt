  "purpose": "Define schema for Blackbird IR device actions and supported properties.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or data at runtime; the code defines a schema class with type annotations and a regex validation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data at runtime are present; this is a class definition, not executable logic.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink occurs in this static class definition.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a class definition using Pydantic for data validation, with type annotations and a regex constraint for 'actionType'. It includes an example usage in the docstring. There are no input/output operations, external data fetches, or dynamic behaviors. No signs of malicious intent or code that could be exploited maliciously are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard schema definition with proper validation, without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
