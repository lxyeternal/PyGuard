{
  "purpose": "Define a schema for Blackbird IR device action properties including supported operations and result types.",
  "sources": "Imports from pydantic and braket.device_schema modules; class attributes; example JSON input.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data handling or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Parsing JSON input into class instance via parse_raw (implied in the example).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, no suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data model for device action properties, utilizing pydantic validation for schema enforcement. It imports necessary modules, sets constraints on the fields (such as regex validation and maximum items), and includes an example of parsing JSON input. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or obfuscated behavior. The code's purpose is schema validation and does not involve any network, file, or environment manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward schema definition for device actions, with no malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behavior detected.",
