{
  "purpose": "Define schema for properties of OpenQASM devices, including supported operations, result types, and device capabilities.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the class attributes, which are primarily type annotations and default values; no external input parsing or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; the code is purely a schema definition without external data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code does not process external inputs directly.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward class schema definition with no suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a class schema using Pydantic for data validation, defining various properties related to OpenQASM device actions. It includes type annotations, optional fields, default values, and a regex constraint on 'actionType'. No data reading, external input handling, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears to serve as a data structure, with examples provided for clarity. There are no indications of malicious behavior or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard schema definition for device properties and does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is safe and appears to be used for data validation and structure enforcement.",
