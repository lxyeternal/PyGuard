  "purpose": "Define schema for OpenQASM device action properties in a quantum computing framework, enabling validation and structured representation of device capabilities and restrictions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources read; primarily static class attributes and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or external data effects; no data leakage or system modifications present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static schema definition with optional attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs detected. Use of regex in class attribute is standard for validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data schema class using pydantic for validation. It specifies various attributes related to OpenQASM device capabilities. There are no inputs from external sources or outputs that could lead to security issues. No dynamic execution, code injection, or malicious behavior is present. The class relies on static type annotations and optional fields, typical for schema definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard schema definition for device properties with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, well-structured quantum computing SDK or framework, with no indicators of supply chain or security threats.",
