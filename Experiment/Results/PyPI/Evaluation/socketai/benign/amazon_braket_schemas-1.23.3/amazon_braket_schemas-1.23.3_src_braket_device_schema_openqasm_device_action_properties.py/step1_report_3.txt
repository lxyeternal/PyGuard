{
  "purpose": "Defines a schema class for properties related to OpenQASM device actions, including configuration options and supported features.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (pydantic, braket), and class attributes initialized with default values or data parsed from JSON input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system calls present.",
  "flows": "Input JSON data parsed into class attributes, with no external system interaction or data leakage points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns observed. Use of optional list defaults appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a data schema class definition leveraging pydantic for validation. It contains attribute declarations with type hints and default values, including optional fields and regex validation for 'actionType'. The class is designed for configuration validation, with example documentation. No external data flows, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious code constructs, and no hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward schema definition for device properties, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions solely as a data validation model.",
