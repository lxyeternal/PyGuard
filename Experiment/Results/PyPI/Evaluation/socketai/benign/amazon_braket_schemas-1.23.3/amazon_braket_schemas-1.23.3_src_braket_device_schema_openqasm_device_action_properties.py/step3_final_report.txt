{
  "purpose": "Defines a schema for properties of OpenQASM device actions, used for validation and configuration within a quantum SDK.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from JSON or other serialized data to parse into the schema attributes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effects; the code only validates data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the schema parsing process, which validates and stores it without executing or transmitting it elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static pydantic schema class with no external data handling, code execution, or malicious patterns. The regex validation is standard, and default values are appropriate. All reports correctly identify it as benign with no security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident, and the code is safe for supply chain use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured data schema with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
