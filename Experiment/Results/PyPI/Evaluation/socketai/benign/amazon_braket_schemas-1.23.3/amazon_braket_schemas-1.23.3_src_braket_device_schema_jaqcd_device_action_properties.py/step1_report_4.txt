{
  "purpose": "Define schema for JAQCD device action properties, including supported operations, result types, and rewiring support.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; relies on class attributes and external JSON data during parsing.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that handle untrusted data directly; primarily schema validation.",
  "flows": "JSON input data flows through parse_raw into class attributes, but no unsafe data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns. Usage of regex for validation is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data schema using Pydantic with type constraints and regex validation for 'actionType'. It includes example usage. No external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code behavior. The code appears to serve as a data model for validation and serialization/deserialization purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward schema definition for device properties with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and well-structured for its intended purpose.",
