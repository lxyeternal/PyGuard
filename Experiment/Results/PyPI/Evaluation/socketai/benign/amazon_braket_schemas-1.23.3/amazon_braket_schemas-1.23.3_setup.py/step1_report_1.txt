{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package for distribution, specifying metadata, dependencies, and package structure.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, reads the version from a source file (_version.py).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data outputs or effects.",
  "flows": "Reads version information from a file, uses setuptools to configure package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with no suspicious code patterns or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard setuptools functions for package setup. It reads a README file for long description, and extracts version info from a specific source file, likely a version declaration. The setup() call includes typical package metadata, dependencies, and extras. No external input is used in a way that could lead to code injection. No suspicious or unusual behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate setup script for a Python package. No malicious intent or malicious code elements are detected.",
