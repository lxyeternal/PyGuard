  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.\n- The code reads static files for description and version info, then calls `setup()` with standard parameters.\n- No external input, untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The version extraction method, while somewhat fragile, is not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness:** The code performs typical package setup tasks without any issues.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; all reports agree on this.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None identified.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The only minor point is that the version extraction from `_version.py` relies on the last line, which could be fragile if the file format changes. However, this is not malicious, just a potential maintenance concern.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correct.\n- **Risk score:** 0 or 0.5. All reports give 0 or 1; given the absence of any issues, 0 is appropriate. A score of 1 would suggest high risk, which is unjustified here.\n\n### Justification:\n- Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws are detected, the risk score should remain at **0**.\n- The malware score is correctly 0, reflecting no malicious intent.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- The only potential concern is the fragile version extraction, but it does not impact security.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all findings are based on code analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or security issues. The scores are appropriate, and no changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0            | No malicious code or behavior detected                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            | No obfuscation or hidden code patterns                     |\n| Security Risk    | 0            | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified          |\n\n**This code is safe and legitimate.**",
