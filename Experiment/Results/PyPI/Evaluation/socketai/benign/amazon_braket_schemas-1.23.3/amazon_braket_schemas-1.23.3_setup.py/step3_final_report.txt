{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads README.md for description and extracts version info from a source file, then calls setuptools.setup() with metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; reads '_version.py' for version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or external outputs; static file reads only.",
  "flows": "Reads static files; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setup code. Version extraction relies on last line, which could be fragile but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It reads static files for description and version, then calls setup() with standard parameters. There are no dynamic or untrusted inputs, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The version extraction method is somewhat fragile but not malicious. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Python package setup script with no malicious or security issues. The scores are justified, and no modifications are necessary.",
