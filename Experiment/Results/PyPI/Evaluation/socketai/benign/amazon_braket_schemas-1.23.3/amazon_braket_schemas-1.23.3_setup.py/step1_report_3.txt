{
  "purpose": "This code sets up the packaging configuration for the 'amazon-braket-schemas' Python library, defining dependencies, metadata, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, reads version info from 'src/braket/_schemas/_version.py'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or execution points that process external input or data; setup configuration is static.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file, then passes static arguments to 'setup()' to package the library.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behaviors. The version extraction from a file appears straightforward but could be fragile if the file format changes.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' functions, reads static files for documentation and version info, then calls 'setup()' with static parameters. The dependencies listed are standard, and the code appears to be a typical setup script. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets or credentials. The only potential issue is the fragile version extraction method, which relies on the last line of a specific file, but this is not malicious. Overall, the script is standard package setup code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious behavior detected. It performs static file reads and package configuration, with no suspicious or harmful actions.",
