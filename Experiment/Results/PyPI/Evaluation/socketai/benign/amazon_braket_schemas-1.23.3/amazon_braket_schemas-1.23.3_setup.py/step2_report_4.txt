  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose: Standard setup for a Python package.  \n- Findings: Reads README.md, extracts version from _version.py, no suspicious code.  \n- Malware score: 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n- Confidence: 1 — very high.  \n- Obfuscated: 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- Security risk: 0 — no evident security issues.  \n**Assessment:** Completely aligns with the code. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Purpose: Standard package setup.  \n- Findings: Reads README.md and version file, no suspicious patterns.  \n- Malware score: 0 — no malware detected.  \n- Confidence: 1.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.  \n- Security risk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct; the code is typical setup code.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Findings: Reads files, no malicious code, just a note about fragile version extraction.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Confidence: 1.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.  \n- Security risk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate; no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Findings: Standard setup, no suspicious activity.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Confidence: 1.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.  \n- Security risk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Correct; typical setup script.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Purpose: Same as above.  \n- Findings: Reads files, no suspicious patterns, dependencies are standard.  \n- Malware score: 0.  \n- Confidence: 1.  \n- Obfuscated: 0.  \n- Security risk: 0.  \n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports consistently conclude that the code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected or implied.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — standard setup, no security issues.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent with the code.**",
