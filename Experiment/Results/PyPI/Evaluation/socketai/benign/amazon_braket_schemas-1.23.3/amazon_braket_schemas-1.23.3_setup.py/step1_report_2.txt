{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the amazon-braket-schemas Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long_description; reading the version from src/braket/_schemas/_version.py; static metadata assignments in setup()",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written or sent over the network",
  "flows": "Data read from files (README.md, _version.py) used in setup metadata; no flow from untrusted sources to critical operations",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. All operations are standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup activities: reading a README for description, extracting version info from a source file, and calling setuptools.setup() with metadata and dependencies. No code executes untrusted input or performs suspicious actions. The dependencies listed are typical for testing, linting, and documentation, with no indication of malicious intent. No external network connections, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security flaws based on the provided content.",
