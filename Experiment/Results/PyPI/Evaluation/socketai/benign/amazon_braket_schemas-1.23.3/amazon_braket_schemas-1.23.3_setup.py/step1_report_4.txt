{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package called 'amazon-braket-schemas', configuring its metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, reads version info from 'src/braket/_schemas/_version.py'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; standard setup script.",
  "flows": "Reads version info -> uses it in setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; no hardcoded credentials, no unusual code behavior, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious URLs or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading files for description and version, defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It does not include any code that executes untrusted input, makes network connections, or manipulates data in a suspicious manner. All dependencies and files appear to be standard and benign. No obfuscation or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, well-structured, and safe for use.",
