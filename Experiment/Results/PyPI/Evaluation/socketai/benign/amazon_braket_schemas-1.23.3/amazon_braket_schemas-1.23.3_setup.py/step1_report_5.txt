{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the amazon-braket-schemas Python package, including dependencies, metadata, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading the long description from README.md; reading version information from src/braket/_schemas/_version.py.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is directly written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reading files for version and description, then passing data to setup(), with dependencies specified for installation and testing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The version extraction relies on parsing the last line of a version file, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python library. It reads the long description from a Markdown file and extracts the version from a specific Python file. Dependencies are specified clearly. No code injection, dynamic execution, or suspicious network activity. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical Python package setup procedures. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal, benign setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
