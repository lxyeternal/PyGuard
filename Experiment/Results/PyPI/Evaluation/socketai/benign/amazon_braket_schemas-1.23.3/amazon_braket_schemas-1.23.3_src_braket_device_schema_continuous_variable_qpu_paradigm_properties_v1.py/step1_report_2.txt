{
  "purpose": "Define schema for continuous variable quantum processing unit properties in a structured manner",
  "sources": "Input JSON data via parse_raw_schema method, data fields in the class (attributes)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; data is used internally for validation/parsing, no untrusted data processing or output specified",
  "flows": "Input JSON data flows into class parsing method, populating attributes",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; standard schema definition, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code imports schema validation tools and defines a data class with attributes that describe quantum device properties. It includes an example JSON for schema validation. No external data is processed at runtime beyond schema parsing. The class only models data; it does not execute external commands, network calls, or handle sensitive information. The code appears to be a standard schema definition with proper usage of Pydantic and no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical data schema class definition with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any network communication, data leakage, or execute any code at runtime beyond data validation.",
