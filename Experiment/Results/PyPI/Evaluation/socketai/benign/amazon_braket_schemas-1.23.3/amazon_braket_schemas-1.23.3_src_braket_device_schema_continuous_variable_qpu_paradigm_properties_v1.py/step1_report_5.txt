{
  "purpose": "Define schema for continuous variable quantum processing unit properties using Pydantic models",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are explicitly read; the class defines data structure schema only",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs; no untrusted data handling or network interactions present",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON input to schema parsing, with no external data manipulations or transfers",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code, no malicious functions",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines a data schema with Pydantic models, including documentation and example usage. It imports only standard libraries and no network, file, or external input/output operations. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic is present. The class structure and annotations are standard and intended solely for data validation and serialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward schema definition for quantum device properties, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
