  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently state that the code is a schema definition using Pydantic for quantum device properties.\n- No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The example JSON and class attributes are standard for data validation purposes.\n- The code appears purely structural and documentation-oriented.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The security risk score is 0, as no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are identified.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and consistent.\n\n**Assessment of scores:**\n- Given the analysis, the scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate.\n- The confidence score of 1 is justified, as all reports agree and the code is straightforward.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- Malware score: **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- Obfuscated score: **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- Risk score: **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**Final remarks:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured schema class for data validation.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided reports and analysis.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
