  "purpose": "Define a data schema class for continuous variable quantum device properties using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute definitions, and example usage in docstring.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; class only defines data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Pydantic class for data validation, defines a schema class with clearly named attributes representing device properties, and includes a comprehensive docstring with example usage. No external data sources or sinks are involved, nor are there any dynamic code execution or obfuscation features. The code appears to be straightforward schema definition for data validation and serialization, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard schema definition for device properties with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. It is a benign, well-structured data model used for validation and documentation.",
