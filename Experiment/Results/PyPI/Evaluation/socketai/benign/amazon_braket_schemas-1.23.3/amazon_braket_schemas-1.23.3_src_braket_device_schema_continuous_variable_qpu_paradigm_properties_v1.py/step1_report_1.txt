{
  "purpose": "Define properties for continuous variable quantum processing units (QPU) with schema validation.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; schema parsing and class attributes are statically defined.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; data is stored in class attributes.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; schema parsing occurs on static JSON input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard schema class definition with descriptive docstring.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data schema using Pydantic for validation and structured data representation of quantum device properties. It imports necessary modules, defines a class with attributes and example usage, and sets a constant header. No dynamic code execution, input/output handling, or network interactions are present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic are observed. The schema appears purely structural and documentation-oriented.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard schema definition for quantum device properties with no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It is a typical implementation for data validation and serialization, with no indications of supply chain or malware concerns.",
