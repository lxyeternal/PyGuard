  "purpose": "Defines a Pydantic schema class for continuous variable quantum device properties, including attributes like native gates, modes, layout, and gate parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads input JSON data for schema validation via parse_raw_schema method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; primarily used for data validation and serialization.",
  "flows": "Input JSON data -> parse_raw_schema -> class attributes and validation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; static schema definition with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward schema class using Pydantic, with a detailed docstring and example JSON. It contains no dynamic code, network calls, or hardcoded secrets. The class-level constant _PROGRAM_HEADER is a static schema header. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The schema attributes are standard for describing quantum device properties. The example JSON has a minor formatting issue (missing comma), but this is only in documentation, not in executable code. The overall structure is safe, static, and documentation-oriented. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard schema definition for quantum device properties with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The analysis confirms it is safe and purely structural, suitable for data validation purposes.",
