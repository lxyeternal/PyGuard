{
  "purpose": "Define a data schema class for continuous variable quantum processing unit (QPU) properties",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries, class attributes, and class-level constants",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; class attributes are used for data storage only",
  "flows": "Data flows from input JSON to class instance via parsing; no untrusted data flows to external systems",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports schema validation libraries and defines a class with schema attributes for quantum device properties. It includes detailed docstrings with example JSON data for parsing. There are no code injection, network operations, or data leaks present. The class acts solely as a schema container, with no dynamic execution or external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard schema definition intended for data validation and parsing. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
