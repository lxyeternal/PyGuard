{
  "purpose": "Defines enumerations and data models for device actions in Amazon Braket's quantum computing framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from enum, typing, and pydantic modules; no external input reading; no user input or environment variable reads.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON input into the pydantic model for validation; no external data flows or network communications present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The code is standard for data modeling and validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum for device action types and a pydantic model for device action properties. It imports well-known modules without dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. The comments are descriptive, and the code structure follows standard practices. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward data modeling module with no malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks identified. It simply defines data structures for use within a larger system.",
