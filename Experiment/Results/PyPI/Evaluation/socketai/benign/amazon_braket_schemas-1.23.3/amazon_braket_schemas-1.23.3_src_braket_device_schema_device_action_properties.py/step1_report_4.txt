  "purpose": "Define enums and data models for device actions in a quantum computing SDK, specifically for Amazon Braket.",
  "sources": "Imports from enum, typing, and pydantic; class and attribute definitions; docstrings.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is being processed or output in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines static classes and types.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of an Enum class for action types and a Pydantic BaseModel for device properties. It includes descriptive docstrings and type annotations. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or network operations are present. The code appears to be standard SDK or API model definitions intended for data validation and serialization. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard data model and enum definitions with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
