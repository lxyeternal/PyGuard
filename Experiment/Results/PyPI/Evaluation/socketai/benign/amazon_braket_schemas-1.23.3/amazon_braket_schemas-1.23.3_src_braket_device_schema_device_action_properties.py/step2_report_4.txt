  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward data model defining an Enum and a Pydantic model.\n   - No dynamic code execution, external input processing, or network activity.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as benign and standard for data validation within an SDK.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The `confidence` score is 1, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - All reports agree that the risk is negligible; hence, scores of 0 are appropriate.\n   - No need to elevate the risk score.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 across all reports is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They base their conclusions on static code analysis, which is appropriate here.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the detailed analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, well-structured data model with no malicious or security-compromising features.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:** The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately. No adjustments needed.",
