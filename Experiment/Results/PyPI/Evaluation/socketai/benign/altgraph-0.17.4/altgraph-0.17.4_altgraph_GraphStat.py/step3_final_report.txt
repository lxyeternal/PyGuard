  "sources": "graph.inc_degree, graph.out_degree, iteration over graph nodes",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs",
  "flows": "Node iteration -> degree retrieval -> binning -> histogram result",
  "anomalies": "Use of _EPS for numerical stability, which is standard; no suspicious code or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward statistical analysis of graph degrees, with no external system calls, network activity, or malicious patterns. The use of _EPS is a common practice for numerical stability. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports align with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for graph degree analysis. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified and should be adjusted to 0. The malware score remains 0, obfuscation score 0, and overall security risk 0.",
