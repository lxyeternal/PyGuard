{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to compute degree distribution statistics of a graph object, including binning data for visualization.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the graph object (graph.inc_degree, graph.out_degree, iterating over graph nodes), and input values for _binning from provided data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data directly; no data writes or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from graph node degree retrieval into local variables, then into the _binning function which processes the values into histogram bins.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears straightforward, intended for statistical analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to compute degree distributions from a graph object, with flexible binning options. The _binning function calculates histogram bins, avoiding outliers with try-except. No code injection, network activity, or system manipulation present. No obfuscation or hidden behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard graph analysis utility with no malicious intent. It performs data processing related to graph statistics without any suspicious behavior.",
