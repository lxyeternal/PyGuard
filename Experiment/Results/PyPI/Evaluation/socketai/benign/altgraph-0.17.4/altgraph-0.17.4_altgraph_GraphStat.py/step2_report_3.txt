  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is straightforward, with no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior. It correctly identifies the functions' purpose and flow.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n  These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the standard nature of the code, use of `_EPS`, and absence of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.  \n  Slightly less than 1, but still reasonable considering the code's benign nature.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, consistent with previous reports, noting no suspicious behavior or external interactions.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.  \n  Appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly different, assigning a `securityRisk=0.1`. The reasoning states no external operations or malicious code, and the only notable variable `_EPS` is benign.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.0.  \n  Given the code's benign nature, a security risk of 0.1 seems unwarranted. The code does not perform any risky operations.\n\n- **Justification:** Since no vulnerabilities, external data handling, or malicious activity are present, setting `securityRisk=0.1` appears unjustified. It should be 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to others, straightforward, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.  \n  Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Reports 1-3 and 5 assign 0, which is correct. Report 4 assigns 0.1, which seems unjustified.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust Report 4's `securityRisk` score from 0.1 to 0** to reflect the actual risk level accurately.\n\n### Overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThe code is a standard graph utility with no malicious or risky behavior. The only minor point is the unnecessary use of `_EPS`, which is standard in numerical calculations and does not introduce security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:**  \nThe reports are generally accurate. The only correction needed is for Report 4's `securityRisk` score, which should be lowered to 0.",
