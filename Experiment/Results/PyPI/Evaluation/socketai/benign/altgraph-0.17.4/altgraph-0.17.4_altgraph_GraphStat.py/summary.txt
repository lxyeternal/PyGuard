  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for graph degree analysis. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified and should be adjusted to 0. The malware score remains 0, obfuscation score 0, and overall security risk 0."
