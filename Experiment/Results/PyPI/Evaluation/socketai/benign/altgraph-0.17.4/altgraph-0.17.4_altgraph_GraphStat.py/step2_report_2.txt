  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the provided scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is straightforward: it computes degree distributions from a graph object, bins data, and returns histogram-like results.\n- The functions use standard Python constructs, with no external system calls, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The only notable variable is `_EPS`, used for numerical stability when determining min/max values, which is common in statistical code.\n- The code does not handle untrusted data directly; it operates on data retrieved from the graph object and input parameters.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly describes the functions' intent.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Finds no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no issues detected.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & sources:** Correctly states the data flow.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; no issues.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- Similar to above, with consistent reasoning.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- Slightly lower confidence (1.0 to 0.1 in securityRisk), but the reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The small securityRisk score seems overly cautious, but since there's no external data handling, it can be justified as minimal.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, with high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** all 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** all very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, justified by the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions.\n- **Confidence:** high, as the analysis aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- The only minor point is the use of `_EPS` for numerical stability, which is standard and harmless.\n- No evidence of vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious code.\n- The code is a typical utility for graph analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation observed)  \n**Risk score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**Additional notes:**  \nThe security risk score of 0.1 in report 4 seems slightly cautious, but given the context, it's acceptable. Overall, the code is benign and well-understood.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code being a standard, safe graph utility. No changes to scores are necessary. The overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the code's straightforward nature and the absence of any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
