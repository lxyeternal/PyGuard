{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to compute degree distribution and binning for graph statistics.",
  "sources": "Reads data from graph nodes via graph.inc_degree and graph.out_degree; reads input data for binning from the values parameter.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, no network or file I/O, no execution of external commands.",
  "flows": "Input from graph nodes flows into degree list, then into _binning, which processes values without executing external code or unsafe operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No unusual or malicious code behavior observed. The use of _EPS for floating point stability is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code calculates degree distributions and bins data points with standard arithmetic operations. It uses straightforward loops and conditionals, with no dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or cryptic patterns. No evidence of malicious intent or security issues is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate graph analysis functions with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It is well-structured, and the operations are typical for statistical processing of graph data.",
