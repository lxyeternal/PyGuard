{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to compute graph degree distribution statistics and binning data for analysis.",
  "sources": "graph object properties (graph.inc_degree, graph.out_degree), input data for binning (values), limits, bin_num, and mode parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data outputs or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (graph, limits, bin_num, mode) flow into functions; data flows into get_deg functions; values flow into _binning, which processes and returns results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of try-except around index calculation is safe but standard. No insecure data handling or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines graph analysis functions with standard calculations. The degree_dist function retrieves node degrees via graph methods and bins the data. The _binning function calculates bin centers and counts data points, handling limits and outliers gracefully. No external data, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are involved. The code appears to be legitimate statistical processing with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code provides legitimate graph statistical functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard data processing without any suspicious activities or malware indicators.",
