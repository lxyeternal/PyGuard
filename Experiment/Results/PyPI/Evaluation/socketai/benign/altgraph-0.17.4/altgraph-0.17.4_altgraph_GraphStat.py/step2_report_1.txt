  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the reports' claims, and then synthesize an overall security assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- The code provides functions to compute degree distributions of a graph, with optional binning.\n- It retrieves node degrees via `graph.inc_degree` or `graph.out_degree`.\n- The `_binning` function bins numerical data into histogram bins, handling outliers with a try-except.\n- No external system calls, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard graph stats, no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, standard degree calculation and binning.\n- **Analysis:** No external calls, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, standard functions.\n- **Analysis:** No external data, no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same, degree analysis and binning.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior, benign use of `_EPS`.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low, possibly considering the use of `_EPS` as a minor concern, but standard in numerical calculations)\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** The code is benign. The slight security risk score seems overcautious but not unreasonable given the `_EPS` usage. Still, `_EPS` is standard for numerical stability.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same purpose, standard calculations.\n- **Analysis:** No external data, no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Consistency:\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious behaviors.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the code analysis.\n- The security risk scores are very low or zero, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final evaluation:\n- The code is a straightforward utility for graph analysis.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The only minor concern is the use of `_EPS`, which is standard for numerical stability and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n| Score Type       | Reasoning                                                                                 |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**     | 0.0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.                                           |\n| **Obfuscated**  | 0.0 — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.                                   |\n| **Risk**        | 0.1 — Very low, primarily due to the use of `_EPS` for numerical stability, which is benign. |\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign graph utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, and I would not recommend any significant changes.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware score: **0**  \n- Obfuscated score: **0**  \n- Risk score: **0.1**  \n\nThis assessment confirms the code's safety and benign nature.",
