{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to compute degree distribution statistics for a graph, including binning data for analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from 'graph' object (graph nodes and their degrees), and input 'values' list for binning.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data output to external systems or network connections.",
  "flows": "Graph nodes -> degree calculation -> binning data -> return results; no external data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code performs standard statistical binning and degree analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to analyze graph node degrees and bin data for visualization or statistical purposes. It utilizes basic Python operations, such as list comprehensions and arithmetic. The only notable variable is '_EPS', used to handle floating point edge cases, which is benign. No external network or file operations, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data handling are present. The code appears to be a straightforward statistical utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for graph degree analysis and data binning without any malicious intent or malicious code. It does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration.",
