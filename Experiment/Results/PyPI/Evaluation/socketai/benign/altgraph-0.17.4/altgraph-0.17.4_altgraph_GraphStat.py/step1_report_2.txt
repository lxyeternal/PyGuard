  "purpose": "Provides functions to compute graph degree distribution statistics and binning data for analysis.",
  "sources": "graph object attributes (inc_degree, out_degree), min/max functions on 'values' list",
  "sinks": "None explicitly found; no data transmission, external system calls, or sensitive data leaks",
  "flows": "Input graph data flows into degree calculation functions; data flows into '_binning' for processing",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Use of _EPS for numerical stability is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for computing degree distributions of a graph, with binning logic. It reads data from graph object methods (inc_degree, out_degree). It processes numerical data for plotting. No external network calls, no code injection, or data leaks identified. The '_EPS' variable is used for numerical stability, typical in statistical calculations. No suspicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard statistical utility for graph analysis without any malicious intent or security risks.",
