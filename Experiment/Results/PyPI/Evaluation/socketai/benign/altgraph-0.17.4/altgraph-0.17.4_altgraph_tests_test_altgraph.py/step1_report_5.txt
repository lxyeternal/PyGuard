{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the Graph class from the altgraph library, verifying graph operations and algorithms.",
  "sources": "Reads from hardcoded list of edges to build graph; no external data sources or user input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow paths leading to external systems, network, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code operates internally on in-memory graph data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code uses standard unittest framework for testing.",
  "analysis": "The script defines unit tests for a graph data structure, including node and edge counts, BFS traversal, hop calculation, and shortest path determination. All data used is statically defined within the code. There are no indications of external data inputs, network communication, or malicious intent. The code appears to be standard testing code for validating graph algorithms, with no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward unit test suite for graph operations with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It performs internal tests using static data and does not interact with external systems or sensitive data.",
