{
  "purpose": "A unit test suite for the 'altgraph' library, verifying graph operations such as node/edge counts, BFS traversal, hops, and shortest path calculations.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded list of edges within the test setup.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the hardcoded edges into the graph construction, then through the test assertions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a graph from static data, performs standard graph algorithm tests, and contains no external inputs or network activity. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The structure and logic are typical for a unit test suite, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test suite for a graph library, with no malicious or security concerns. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
