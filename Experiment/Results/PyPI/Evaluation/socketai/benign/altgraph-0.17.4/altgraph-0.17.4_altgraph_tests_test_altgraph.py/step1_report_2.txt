  "purpose": "Unit testing for the altgraph Graph and GraphAlgo classes to verify graph operations and algorithms.",
  "sources": "Reading data from hardcoded edge list during setup, importing modules os, sys, unittest, and altgraph.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external data outputs identified.",
  "flows": "Input is from hardcoded edges during setup; no external data flows to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. The code appears straightforward and standard for unit tests.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a specific graph library, defines test cases that create a graph from a predefined edge list, and performs typical graph algorithm tests. There are no signs of data exfiltration, malicious logic, or obfuscated code. No external network calls or unsafe data handling are present. The code serves purely as a test suite for the graph library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit testing script for graph algorithms, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It functions solely for validation purposes.",
