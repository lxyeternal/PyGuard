{
  "purpose": "The code defines an ObjectGraph class for managing a graph of objects with unique identifiers, providing methods to manipulate and traverse the graph.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of untrusted input; primarily uses internal data structures and object attributes.",
  "sinks": "Methods that modify the graph such as add_node, add_edge, hide_node, hide_edge, and update_edge_data. No direct data leaks or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "Internal method calls manipulate the graph structure without external data flows or untrusted inputs being processed into critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The debug messaging functions print debug info based on debug level, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a graph of objects with identifiers, enabling addition, removal, referencing, and filtering of nodes and edges. No code injection, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code relies on an external Graph class, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior in the methods shown. Debug functions are standard and do not pose security risks. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation for managing object graphs with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly performs data structure manipulations, and there are no indications of malware or malicious behaviors.",
