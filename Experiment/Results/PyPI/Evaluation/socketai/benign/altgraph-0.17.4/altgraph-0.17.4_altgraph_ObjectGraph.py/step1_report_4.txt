{
  "purpose": "Define and manage a graph of objects with identifiers, providing methods for node and edge manipulation, filtering, and debugging.",
  "sources": "Input sources include method parameters such as nodes, edges, and filter lists; also attribute access for node identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Methods that modify the graph structure (add_node, add_edge, hide_node, hide_edge, update_edge_data) act as sinks; no external data outputs or network operations observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through identification methods to graph modification functions; no suspicious source-to-sink data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. No evidence of malicious code such as network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages an object graph structure, with functions for adding, removing, and referencing nodes and edges. It includes debugging print statements controlled by a debug level. All operations are confined within the graph data structure, with no external or hidden actions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. No obfuscated code, data leaks, or suspicious external interactions are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard graph management utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not exhibit malware behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage features. It is a straightforward implementation for handling object graphs with debugging capabilities.",
