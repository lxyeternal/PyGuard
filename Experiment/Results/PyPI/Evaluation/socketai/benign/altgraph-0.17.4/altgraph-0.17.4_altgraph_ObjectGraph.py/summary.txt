  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard graph utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, though caution should be exercised if external inputs are untrusted, as they could be used to manipulate the graph structure maliciously. Overall, the code's security posture is very low risk."
