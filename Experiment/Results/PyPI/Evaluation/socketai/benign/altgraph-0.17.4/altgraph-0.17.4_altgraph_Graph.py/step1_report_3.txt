{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Graph class for representing and manipulating directed graphs, including methods for adding/hiding/restoring nodes and edges, traversal algorithms, and graph properties.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from method parameters such as edges, nodes, start/end nodes, and conditions for traversals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are explicitly present that process untrusted data for harmful effects; however, data is stored and retrieved from internal dictionaries and lists, with no apparent direct data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into internal data structures; traversal methods generate sequences based on internal state; no external data flows are evident that could lead to data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code uses standard Python constructs and data structures. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. No signs of malicious intent such as network activity, data theft, or harmful system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a directed graph with methods for node/edge management, traversal, and analysis. It employs standard Python data structures and algorithms, with no indication of malicious payloads. The functions for hiding/restoring nodes or edges do not perform any malicious actions beyond internal data management. No external network or system modifications are present. The code appears to serve as a utility for graph processing without any hidden or malicious functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard graph data structure implementation with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe to use from a supply chain security perspective.",
