  "purpose": "Implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and a priority dictionary data structure for graph analysis.",
  "sources": "Graph object methods such as out_nbrs(), edge_by_node(), and edge_data() that provide node neighbors, edge identifiers, and edge weights.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network communication; data flows are confined within the algorithm's internal data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from graph methods (sources) through the algorithm's computations to the final shortest path outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard graph algorithms with clear documentation and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. It relies on external graph data sources and internal data structures, with no external communication or file operations. Exception handling is straightforward, and the code uses well-known algorithms and data structures. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. It appears safe and suitable for supply chain use.",
