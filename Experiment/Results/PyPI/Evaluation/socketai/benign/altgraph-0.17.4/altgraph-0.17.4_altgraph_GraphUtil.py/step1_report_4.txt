  "purpose": "Utility functions for generating and filtering graphs in the altgraph library, including random and scale-free graph generation, and a filtering utility based on DFS traversal.",
  "sources": "Random choices in generate_random_graph and generate_scale_free_graph, reading node and edge data, and node attributes in filter_stack.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leak points are present; the code primarily constructs and traverses graphs without external data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Generation functions read parameters and internal state, select nodes/edges randomly, and build graphs; filter_stack performs DFS, reading node data and edges, and outputs filtered node sets and orphans.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. Usage of random.choice for graph construction is standard in stochastic graph generation. No obfuscated or malicious code segments detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides graph utility functions for random and scale-free graph creation, with parameter checks and defensive conditions against self-loops and multi-edges. The random selection processes are standard for such algorithms. The filter_stack function performs a DFS traversal, applying user-provided filters to node data, and tracks nodes and 'orphans' based on filter results. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external data exfiltration, or covert operations. The overall structure and logic are consistent with typical graph algorithms, with no suspicious side-effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for graph generation and filtering, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard operations for graph algorithms with no hidden or harmful behaviors detected.",
