  "purpose": "Utility functions for graph generation and filtering, primarily for creating random or scale-free graphs and filtering nodes based on data.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions (node_num, edge_num, steps, growth_num, filters), random.choice() for selecting nodes or edges.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could cause data leaks or security issues; functions mainly manipulate in-memory graph structures.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> function logic (graph construction, node/edge addition) -> return graph objects.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard and does not include suspicious data handling or obfuscated constructs. Use of random.choice is benign here.",
  "analysis": "The code provides graph utility functions: generate_random_graph creates graphs with specified nodes and edges; generate_scale_free_graph creates scale-free networks based on preferential attachment; filter_stack performs DFS-based filtering on graph nodes based on provided filters. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious network activity. All data handling involves only local variables and method calls on the graph objects. The functions do not process or transmit untrusted input beyond normal parameter use, nor do they execute any external commands or handle sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate utility code for graph generation and filtering. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. It operates solely on in-memory graph data structures with no external communication or data leakage points.",
