  "purpose": "A class providing a graphviz (dot language) representation for graph visualization with customization options.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, internal data structures, external filenames, style attributes.",
  "sinks": "External commands invoked via os.system() with concatenated command strings.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into internal structures, then into command strings executed by os.system().",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() with unvalidated, concatenated command strings without sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs graph representations and calls external graphviz tools via os.system(). No obfuscated or malicious code is present. The main security concern is the potential for command injection if filenames or parameters are controlled by an attacker, due to lack of input sanitization. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration is detected. The code is straightforward and intended for visualization purposes. The risk stems from unsafe command execution practices, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for graph visualization, but it relies on os.system() with concatenated inputs, which can be exploited if inputs are manipulated. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary security concern is command injection risk. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.4) are appropriate given the pattern of external command invocation without sanitization.",
