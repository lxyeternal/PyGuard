  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for graph visualization, but it relies on os.system() with concatenated inputs, which can be exploited if inputs are manipulated. No malware or obfuscation is present. The primary security concern is command injection risk. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.4) are appropriate given the pattern of external command invocation without sanitization."
