  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation with Sphinx for the 'altgraph' project.",
  "sources": "Reading files like 'setup.cfg' in get_version(), reading environment variables, and accessing the filesystem (os.path, open()).",
  "sinks": "Reading files (open()), manipulating sys.path, setting configuration variables, and importing modules.",
  "flows": "get_version() reads 'setup.cfg' to extract version information; sys.path modification affects module search paths; no untrusted data flows into security-critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be standard Sphinx configuration with no suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up documentation build parameters, reads version info from a configuration file, and modifies sys.path for module resolution. All file operations are straightforward and pertain to configuration management. No network connections, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The only file read occurs in get_version(), which safely parses a local 'setup.cfg'. No untrusted input sources or sinks that could lead to security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs file reading, path modification, and configuration setup typical for documentation projects. There are no signs of malware or security vulnerabilities.",
