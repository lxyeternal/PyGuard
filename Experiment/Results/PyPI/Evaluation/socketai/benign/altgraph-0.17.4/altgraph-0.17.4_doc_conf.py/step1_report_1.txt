{
  "purpose": "This file is a configuration script for building documentation using Sphinx for the altgraph project.",
  "sources": "Reads system environment variables, filesystem (setup.cfg), and imports standard Python modules.",
  "sinks": "None detected that would process untrusted data or execute code with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reads from filesystem (get_version function) and sets up configuration parameters; no flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution detected. The get_version function reads a local file 'setup.cfg' for version info, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up Sphinx documentation configuration, involving importing modules, defining a function to retrieve version info from a local file, and configuring output options. It does not perform any network operations, evaluate untrusted inputs, or execute code based on external data. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script for Sphinx documentation with no malicious intent, no suspicious behaviors, and no security risks identified.",
