{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Python library for graph data structures and algorithms, providing functionalities for graph manipulation, visualization, and analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'altgraph' package version information via 'pkg_resources.require'. No other data input sources such as user input, network, or environment variables are used.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'pkg_resources.require' to obtain package version, which is a safe, read-only operation; no other sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The only data flow is from the package metadata source into the __version__ variable; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and well-structured with clear intent.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports 'pkg_resources' to determine the version of the 'altgraph' package and defines a custom exception class. There are no input prompts, network operations, or system modifications. The code includes extensive comments, licensing, and author info but nothing indicative of malicious intent or covert behavior. The use of 'pkg_resources.require' is standard for version detection, and the rest is class definition and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, open-source graph library module with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It solely manages version info and defines an exception class. There is no suspicious activity or data exfiltration present.",
