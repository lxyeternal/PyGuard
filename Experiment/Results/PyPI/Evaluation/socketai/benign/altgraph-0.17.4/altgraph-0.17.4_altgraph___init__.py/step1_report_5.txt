{
  "purpose": "Provides a Python library for graph representation, algorithms, visualization, and utilities, including installation instructions and usage examples.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata via 'pkg_resources.require' and imports the 'pkg_resources' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted input or data; no code execution, network, or data leakage functions observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows related to untrusted data or external system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of 'pkg_resources.require' to retrieve package version info is typical; no suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of documentation, package import, version retrieval, and a simple custom exception class. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The only dynamic code execution is limited to obtaining package version info, which is standard practice. The code structure and format are straightforward and typical of Python library modules.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign Python library module for graph operations with no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be legitimate and safe.",
