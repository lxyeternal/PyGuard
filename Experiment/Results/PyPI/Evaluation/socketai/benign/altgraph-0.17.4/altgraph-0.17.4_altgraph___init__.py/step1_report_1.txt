{
  "purpose": "The code provides documentation and setup instructions for the 'altgraph' Python library, including example usage and module descriptions.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and uses 'pkg_resources.require' to determine package version.",
  "sinks": "The only external data access is via 'pkg_resources.require', which queries package metadata. No untrusted input, network, or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the version information is obtained from installed package metadata. No malicious data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated segments. The code consists mainly of comments, documentation, and a simple class definition.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily contains module documentation, usage examples, license information, and a minimal class definition. It imports 'pkg_resources' solely to retrieve package version info. No input/output processing, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious behavior are evident. The code does not perform any network communication, file manipulation, or credential handling. The only potentially notable aspect is the use of 'pkg_resources.require' to programmatically obtain version info, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears solely to provide documentation, setup instructions, and a simple custom exception class. No malicious behavior or security risks are present. It is safe for use.",
