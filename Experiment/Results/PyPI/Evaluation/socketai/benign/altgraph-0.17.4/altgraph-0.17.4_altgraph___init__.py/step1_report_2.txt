{
  "purpose": "This code provides documentation and setup instructions for the altgraph Python library, including a brief example of usage and module descriptions.",
  "sources": "The only code source is the import statement: import pkg_resources, which accesses package metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; the code mainly handles metadata and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only standard import, version retrieval, class definition, and documentation; no anomalies or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily consists of documentation comments, an import of a standard library (pkg_resources), and a simple class definition for GraphError. No user input handling, external data processing, or code execution occurs. The import of pkg_resources is used to retrieve package version info, which is a common practice. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code are detected. The overall structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or main module, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign component of a Python package that handles version info and defines a custom error class. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
