{
  "purpose": "The code provides package version info retrieval, documentation, and a minimal exception class, serving as part of a Python package's core module.",
  "sources": "The only source is the import of 'pkg_resources' used to retrieve package version info via 'pkg_resources.require'.",
  "sinks": "No data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks; version info is read-only and used internally.",
  "flows": "Source is 'pkg_resources.require' reading package metadata; no external data or untrusted input flows into other parts of the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of documentation, a simple class definition, and a version retrieval statement. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The use of 'pkg_resources.require' is a common, safe practice for version detection. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 reflects the potential for file creation during visualization functions, but this is standard and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily serving as documentation and version info retrieval. There is no malicious activity or security concern. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the security risk is negligible.",
