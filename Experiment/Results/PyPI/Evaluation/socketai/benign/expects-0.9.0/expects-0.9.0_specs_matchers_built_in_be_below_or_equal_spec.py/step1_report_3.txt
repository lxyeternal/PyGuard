{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'be_below_or_equal' expectation function in a testing framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads test input values such as 1, 4, and 5 directly within the test cases.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present; the code is purely for testing purposes.",
  "flows": "Input values are compared against expected thresholds within test expectations; no untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated logic, or malicious behavior detected. The code consists of standard testing constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing frameworks, defines multiple test cases with expectations, including negations, and verifies expected failures. It does not perform any network, file, or sensitive data operations. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are evident. All functions are standard assertions for unit testing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for a specific expectation function. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and typical of testing code.",
