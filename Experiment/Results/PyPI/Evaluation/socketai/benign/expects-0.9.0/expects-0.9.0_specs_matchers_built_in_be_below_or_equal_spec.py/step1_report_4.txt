{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of test cases using the 'expects' library to verify the behavior of the 'be_below_or_equal' matcher.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'expects' and 'expects.testing', including test case definitions and failure expectations.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or cause data leaks. No external network or file system interactions.",
  "flows": "The code tests compare input values to expected thresholds and handle expected failures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a set of test cases for a comparison matcher, with no data input sources beyond the test values. There are no external data sources, environment variable reads, or malicious code constructs. The structure is straightforward and adheres to standard testing practices. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of unit tests for a comparison function, with no indications of malicious activity or security risks.",
