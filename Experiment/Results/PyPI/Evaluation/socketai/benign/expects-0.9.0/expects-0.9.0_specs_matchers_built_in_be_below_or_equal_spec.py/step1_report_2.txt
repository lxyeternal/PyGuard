  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'be_below_or_equal' expectation in a testing framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads test case definitions and expectation assertions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks present in this code.",
  "flows": "Input data (test values) flows through expectation checks; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code appears to be standard test definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing libraries and defines multiple test cases to verify the behavior of a custom matcher 'be_below_or_equal'. It tests both passing and failing scenarios, including negations. No external data sources, user input, or network interactions are present. The code structure is typical of unit test scripts, with no unusual language features or obfuscation. It strictly tests logical conditions related to numerical comparisons.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
