{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test suite for a custom matcher 'be_below_or_equal', used to verify numerical comparisons.",
  "sources": "The code imports testing frameworks and defines test cases; no external data sources or inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data leaks, network communications, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows are limited to local test assertions without any data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are detected. The code uses standard testing constructs and a custom matcher.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing libraries, defines multiple test cases with expected outcomes, including negated conditions. All operations are standard assertions within a test framework, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. No external inputs or outputs, and no suspicious code flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test suite for a numerical matcher function, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
