{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of test cases for a custom matcher 'be_below_or_equal' using the 'expects' testing framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from test case values like 1, 4, and 5 within the 'expect' function calls.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or where data could leak or cause harm. No external network, file, or system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input values are compared against expected thresholds within the testing framework. No flow to external systems or untrusted sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code strictly consists of test cases for a comparison matcher.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing functions, defines a set of tests for the 'be_below_or_equal' matcher, and verifies its behavior with different input scenarios. No suspicious logic, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident. The code solely functions as unit tests without any external side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test script for a comparison matcher and contains no malicious intent or security risks.",
