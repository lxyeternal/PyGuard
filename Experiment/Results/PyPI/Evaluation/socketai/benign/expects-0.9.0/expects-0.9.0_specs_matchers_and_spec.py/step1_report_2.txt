{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of test cases using the 'expects' testing framework to verify matcher behaviors.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'expects' and 'expects.testing' modules, which provide testing functions and failure handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks, command execution, or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules to defining test scenarios, with no data input or external communication shown.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected. The code is straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports testing modules, defines test cases using 'describe' and 'it' blocks, and expects certain matcher behaviors. It uses 'expect' assertions to verify matchers such as 'be_true', 'be_above', 'equal', and 'be_an'. The failure blocks indicate expected test failures. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious constructs are present. The code appears to be standard test definitions for a testing framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical set of test cases verifying matcher logic using the 'expects' testing framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and solely intended for testing purposes.",
