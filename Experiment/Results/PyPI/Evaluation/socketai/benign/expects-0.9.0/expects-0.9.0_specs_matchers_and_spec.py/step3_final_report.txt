{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying the behavior of matchers using the 'expects' framework, including combined logical 'and' operations and failure cases.",
  "sources": "The code reads input values directly from literals within expect() calls.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sources or external data sinks; no network or file I/O present.",
  "flows": "Input literals are evaluated and passed directly to matcher functions; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are detected; the code is straightforward test logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard test suite using the 'expects' framework to verify matcher combinations and failure messages. It involves no external data, network activity, or system modifications. The matchers are simple and well-understood, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code's purpose is purely to test matcher behavior, and it does not contain any suspicious patterns or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard test code with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all correctly assigned as 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code and the absence of suspicious features.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
