{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite using the 'expects' library to validate certain conditions and matchers.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; static test code with internal function calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable access observed.",
  "flows": "N/A — the code runs self-contained test assertions with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs straightforward testing without obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'expects' testing library and defines several test cases within 'describe' and 'it' blocks. It verifies matching conditions such as 'be_true', 'be_above', 'equal', and 'be_an'. The tests include expected failures with descriptive messages, indicating typical testing practices. No input/output, network operations, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be a standard test script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite designed to validate matcher behaviors in the 'expects' testing library. It contains no malicious or suspicious activity, and no security risks are apparent.",
