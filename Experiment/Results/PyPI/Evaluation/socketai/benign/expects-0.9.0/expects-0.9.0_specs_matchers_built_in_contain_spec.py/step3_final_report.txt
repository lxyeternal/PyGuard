{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying the behavior of the 'contain' matcher in the 'expects' testing framework, covering various data types and scenarios.",
  "sources": "In-memory data structures such as lists, strings, dict keys, and iterators; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "Assertions on local variables; no external sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Assertions flow from predefined data sources to matcher functions; no external or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests for containment assertions, using static, predefined data. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The assertions are standard and confined within the test framework. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The code's purpose is to validate functionality, not to perform any system modifications or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard test code with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is 0.1 to reflect minimal inherent risk associated with test code. No further action is necessary.",
