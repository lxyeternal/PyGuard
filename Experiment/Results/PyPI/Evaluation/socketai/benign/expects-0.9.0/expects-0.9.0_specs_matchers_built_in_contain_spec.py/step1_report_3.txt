{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'contain' matcher in the 'expects' testing framework, verifying containment assertions on various data types.",
  "sources": "Reading from predefined lists, strings, iterators, dictionaries, and sets; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform external actions; primarily assertion checks on in-memory objects.",
  "flows": "Test inputs flow through assertions to validation logic within the 'expect' framework, with no data leaving the environment or reaching external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code strictly implements standard test assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of structured unit tests for a containment matcher, testing various data structures and scenarios, including positive and negative cases. There are no signs of malicious code, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The code does not include any obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors. All operations are standard assertions within a testing framework, with no network, file, or environment manipulations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of unit tests for a testing framework's containment assertions. It contains no malicious intent, no security risks, and no suspicious anomalies. It is safe and purely for testing purposes.",
