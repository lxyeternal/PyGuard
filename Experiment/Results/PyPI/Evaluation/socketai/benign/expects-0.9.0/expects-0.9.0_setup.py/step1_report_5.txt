  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'expects' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.rst file for long_description; gathers package info via find_packages()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external interactions; no code execution or data handling beyond file reading",
  "flows": "Reads file content (README.rst) and passes static parameters to setup() function",
  "anomalies": "Uses open() without context manager, which is not best practice but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library. It reads a README file to set the long description and defines package metadata and classifiers. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The only notable point is the use of open() without a context manager, which is not an immediate security concern but is a coding best practice issue. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script used for packaging the 'expects' library. It does not contain malicious code or behavior and poses no security threat.",
