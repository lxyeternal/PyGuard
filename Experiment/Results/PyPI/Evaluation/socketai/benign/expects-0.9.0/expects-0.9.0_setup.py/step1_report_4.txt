{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package named 'expects' for distribution, including reading the long description from a README file.",
  "sources": "Reading the file 'README.rst' to obtain the long description.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no sinks that handle untrusted input or data beyond reading a static file.",
  "flows": "The only flow involves reading the static README.rst file into the long_description variable, then passing it into the setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard setup.py structure with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools for package configuration, reads a README file for the package description, and calls setup() with metadata, including package discovery. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, and no network activity. All code appears to be boilerplate for Python package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs standard package configuration tasks without any suspicious or harmful code.",
