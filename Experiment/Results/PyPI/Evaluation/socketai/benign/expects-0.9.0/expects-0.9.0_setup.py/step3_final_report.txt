  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python library, reading README and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file using open() without error handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Reading static file -> setup() call; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context manager; no exception handling; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging Python modules. It reads a static README file without validation or sanitization, and calls setup() with package metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or untrusted data handling. The use of open() without a context manager is a minor best practice issue but not security-related. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware scores of 0 and very low security risk scores (~0.1), which are justified given the simplicity and static nature of the script. No anomalies or signs of obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent. The minor coding style issue (lack of context manager) does not impact security. Overall, the package is safe for use.",
