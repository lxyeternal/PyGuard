  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'expects', used for packaging and distributing the library.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long_description, and package metadata such as name, version, description, url, author, author_email, license, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code does not send data, execute untrusted input, or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Use of open('README.rst') without context management or error handling, which could lead to file access issues, but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard setuptools functions to define package metadata and configuration. It reads the README file to populate long_description. No dynamic code execution, network access, or data processing occurs. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present. The code is a typical setup.py configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It performs expected package configuration tasks.",
