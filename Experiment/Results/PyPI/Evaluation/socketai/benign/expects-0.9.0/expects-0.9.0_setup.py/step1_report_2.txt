  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'expects' Python library, including metadata and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long_description; no other data input sources are present.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data used or passed to system calls or functions that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code performs standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, reads the README file for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata including name, version, description, URL, author details, license, packages, and classifiers. The code is straightforward, adhering to common packaging conventions, with no signs of malicious code or obfuscation. No input validation or external data processing beyond reading a static file is performed. All code appears standard for a Python package setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The package appears safe to use.",
