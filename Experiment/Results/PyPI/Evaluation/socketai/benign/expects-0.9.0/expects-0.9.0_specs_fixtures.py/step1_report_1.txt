  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or external calls detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class variables are static and do not process input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'Foo' with two class attributes 'bar' and 'baz'. There are no functions, input handling, or external interactions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues are present. The code appears to be a simple class definition, likely part of a larger program.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply defines a class with static variables.",
