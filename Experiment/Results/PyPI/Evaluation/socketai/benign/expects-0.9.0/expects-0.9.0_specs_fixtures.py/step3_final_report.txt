{
  "purpose": "The code defines a simple Python class with two static class variables, serving as a minimal data container or placeholder.",
  "sources": "Class definition and class variables; no input, output, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no external calls or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static class variables are not influenced by external input.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of functions, dynamic code, or obfuscation; no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class with static variables, with no functions, input/output, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious or suspicious features. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent and justified given the code's simplicity. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
