  "purpose": "The code appears to be a comment line specifying the encoding used in the Python file.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a single encoding declaration comment with no executable content or logic. There are no suspicious or unusual patterns, secrets, or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a file encoding comment line. There are no functions, variables, input/output operations, or external interactions. Since it lacks any executable or data-handling elements, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. The code is a standard encoding declaration often used at the beginning of Python files to specify UTF-8 encoding.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign and is simply a standard encoding declaration. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
