{
  "purpose": "The code snippet is a minimal Python encoding declaration comment, intended to specify the file's character encoding.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it consists solely of a comment line.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as no executable code or data processing exists.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the snippet contains only a comment with no runtime data or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "The comment line is malformed in some reports ('-*- ... -*-'), but since it is just a comment, this is a minor formatting issue with no security impact.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, non-executable comment specifying UTF-8 encoding. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The syntax issues noted are minor and do not affect security. The malware score is appropriately zero, as there is no malicious intent. The confidence in benignity is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign encoding declaration comments with no malicious or obfuscated content. The risk, malware, and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0, and the confidence is high. No further action is necessary.",
