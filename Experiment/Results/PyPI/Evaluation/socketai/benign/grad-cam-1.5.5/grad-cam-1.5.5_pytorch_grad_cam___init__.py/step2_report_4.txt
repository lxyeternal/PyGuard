  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Only import statements from a reputable open-source visualization library. No suspicious patterns, no dynamic code, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Fully benign. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar import statements, with a note that data might originate from untrusted sources, but the code itself only imports modules.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Slight concern about potential untrusted data sources, but the code snippet itself remains benign. The small securityRisk score reflects this cautious approach.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, only import statements from a well-known interpretability library, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Benign, standard imports.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—benign import statements from a recognized package.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar benign import statements, with a minor securityRisk score of 0.1, likely due to cautious interpretation.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** No actual malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Synthesis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malware, which is consistent with the code being only import statements.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Zero across all reports; the code is straightforward and clear.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, mainly due to cautious interpretation of potential untrusted data sources, but the code itself does not perform any risky operations.\n\n**Important considerations:**\n- The code is purely static import statements from a reputable open-source library.\n- No dynamic execution, network activity, or data manipulation is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic.\n- The minimal security risk scores are appropriate given the context.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no actual security risk present; only import statements)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a benign set of import statements from a well-known open-source interpretability library. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is evident. The minimal security risk scores are appropriate, and the overall assessment should be:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis reflects a safe, standard setup for model interpretability in a machine learning project.",
