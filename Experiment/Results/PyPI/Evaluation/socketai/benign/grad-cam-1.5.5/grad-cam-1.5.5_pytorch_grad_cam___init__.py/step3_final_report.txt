  "purpose": "Import statements for various visualization and interpretability modules from the 'pytorch_grad_cam' library.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from the 'pytorch_grad_cam' package.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted data handling occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a reputable open-source library used for model interpretability. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling. The import statements are standard and do not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. The security risk is minimal, and the code is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of import statements from a well-known open-source visualization library. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk present. The minimal security risk score (0.1) is acceptable but could be refined to 0 for accuracy. Overall, the code is safe and poses no threat.",
