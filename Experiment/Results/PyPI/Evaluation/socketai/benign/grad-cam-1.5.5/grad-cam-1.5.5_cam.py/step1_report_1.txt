  "purpose": "The script loads an image, computes class activation maps (CAM) using various methods, and generates visualizations along with guided backpropagation results for interpretability.",
  "sources": "Reads image from filesystem (`cv2.imread`), command-line arguments (`argparse`), and potentially imports external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Writes images to output directory (`cv2.imwrite`), no other sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input image is loaded and preprocessed, then passed to CAM algorithms and guided backpropagation models, then results are saved to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual or suspicious code behavior. The code uses standard image processing and visualization techniques. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries for argument parsing, OS interaction, image processing, and deep learning with PyTorch and torchvision. It loads a pre-trained ResNet50 model, applies a selected CAM method for interpretability, and performs guided backpropagation. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or network communication is evident. It writes output images to disk in a specified directory. The use of well-known libraries and straightforward image processing indicates typical behavior for model interpretability. No anomalies, malicious patterns, or suspicious data flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard interpretability tool for deep learning models, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It solely processes images, generates visual explanations, and saves results locally. No malicious or sabotage behavior is present.",
