{
  "purpose": "The script performs image analysis using Grad-CAM methods and Guided Backpropagation to visualize model activations for a given input image.",
  "sources": "Input image path provided via command line argument, environment variables (if any), and command-line parameters (device, method, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Saving images to specified output directory, model loading, and processing functions that write images to disk.",
  "flows": "Input image is read from filesystem, processed, and results are saved back to disk; command-line arguments influence behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors detected; all functions perform standard image processing and visualization tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes argument parsing for image input, device, method selection, and output directory. It loads a pretrained ResNet-50 model, performs Grad-CAM visualization with various methods, and saves the generated images. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or code that could leak data or harm the system are present. Third-party libraries used are standard for image processing and visualization. The command-line interface allows flexible operation but does not facilitate malicious activity. No obfuscated code or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for generating visualization heatmaps using Grad-CAM techniques. It processes an image, produces visualizations, and saves results, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
