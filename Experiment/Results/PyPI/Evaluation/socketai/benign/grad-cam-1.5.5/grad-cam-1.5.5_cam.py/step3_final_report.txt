{
  "purpose": "The code performs visualization of model interpretability using CAM and guided backpropagation techniques on an image input, saving the resulting images locally.",
  "sources": "Reads input image from disk via cv2.imread; uses model outputs and internal activations.",
  "sinks": "Saves generated visualization images to specified output directory on disk.",
  "flows": "Loads image -> preprocesses -> feeds into model -> computes CAM and guided backpropagation -> overlays and processes images -> saves output images.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard implementation for interpretability visualization using common libraries (PyTorch, OpenCV). It does not perform any network communication, dynamic code execution, or contain hidden behaviors. It reads an image, processes it through a pre-trained model, computes CAM and guided backpropagation, and saves the results locally. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign interpretability visualization tool with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard image processing and visualization tasks without any suspicious activity.",
