  "purpose": "Implement a ShapleyCAM class for model interpretability, leveraging gradient and Hessian-Vector products to compute activation map weights.",
  "sources": "Input tensors from model activations and gradients, gradient computations via torch.autograd.grad.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; computations are internal, involving tensor operations and gradient calculations.",
  "flows": "Gradients and activations flow from input through backward computations to weight calculations; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Operations are standard for interpretability research.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard interpretability method using gradient and Hessian-vector products, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors. It relies solely on PyTorch autograd functions and tensor transformations. No network activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The operations are typical for research in explainability, and the code is clear and readable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a Shapley-value-based CAM method. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) justified by the nature of gradient computations but no actual malicious activity.",
