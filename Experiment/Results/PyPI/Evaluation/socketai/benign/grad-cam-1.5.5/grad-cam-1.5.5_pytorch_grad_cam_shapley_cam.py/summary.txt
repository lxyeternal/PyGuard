  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a Shapley-value-based CAM method. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1) justified by the nature of gradient computations but no actual malicious activity."
