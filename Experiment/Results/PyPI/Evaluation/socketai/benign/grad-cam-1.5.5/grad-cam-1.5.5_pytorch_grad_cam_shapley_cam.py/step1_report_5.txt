  "purpose": "Define a class ShapleyCAM for visual explanation of neural network models using a Shapley value perspective, specifically for computing CAM weights based on gradients and Hessian-vector products.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (typing, pytorch_grad_cam, torch, numpy), uses model input parameters, and accesses model-related attributes and gradients during get_cam_weights method.",
  "sinks": "Uses torch.autograd.grad for gradient computation, converts tensors to numpy arrays, and performs calculations involving model gradients and activations.",
  "flows": "Input tensor and model activations/gradients flow through gradient computations (hvp), reshape transforms, and then to numpy conversion and averaging for weight calculation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No unusual data leaks, malicious network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears standard for model interpretability.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for interpretability purposes, utilizing gradients, Hessian-vector products, and reshape transforms. It relies on torch.autograd for gradient calculations and numpy for processing. No suspicious or malicious operations are evident; the code's purpose aligns with model explanation. All tensor operations are standard, and no network or system-level calls or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of a model interpretability technique based on CAM and Shapley values. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code performs gradient and tensor computations for visualization purposes only.",
