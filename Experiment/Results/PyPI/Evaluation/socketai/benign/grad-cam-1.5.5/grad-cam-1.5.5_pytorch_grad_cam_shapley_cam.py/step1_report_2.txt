{
  "purpose": "Implementation of a custom CAM (Class Activation Mapping) technique called ShapleyCAM for interpretability of neural network models, using gradient and Hessian-Vector products.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (typing, torch, numpy), and the BaseCAM class and ModelTargets from the pytorch_grad_cam package.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no network calls, file operations, or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "No external or untrusted data flows identified; data flows within the model computations and gradient calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs present. The code performs legitimate model interpretability calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of BaseCAM for a custom interpretability method. It overrides the get_cam_weights function to compute weights based on gradients and Hessian-vector products, which is a mathematical operation used in interpretability research. All operations involve standard tensor operations, gradient computations, and numpy conversions, without any suspicious network or system interactions. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of a model interpretability technique, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It strictly performs gradient-based calculations for explainability purposes.",
