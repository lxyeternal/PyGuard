{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for implementing Ablation CAM visualization techniques on deep learning models, specifically for interpretability of model decisions in vision tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports external libraries such as cv2, numpy, torch, tqdm, and a specific CAM base class; reads data via model inference and batch processing.",
  "sinks": "Uses model inference outputs for calculations; does not directly write to files, network, or external systems; no data leaks or sensitive information exposure detected.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are processed through model inference, then modified via ablation layers; weights are computed based on model outputs and stored for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "None of the code performs unusual operations; no hardcoded secrets or secrets management; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a standard interpretability technique (Ablation CAM) with class-based modular design. It replaces model layers temporarily for ablation, calculates weights, and restores original layers. Usage of tqdm for progress indication is typical. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is present. The code is consistent with standard practices and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a visualization technique for model interpretability. It contains no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It mainly manipulates model layers and performs numerical calculations without any suspicious operations.",
