  "purpose": "Implementation of AblationCAM for model interpretability, manipulating model layers to assess feature importance.",
  "sources": "Model layers, input tensors, activation outputs, and target categories.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "flows": "Input tensors are processed through the model; layers are temporarily replaced with ablation variants; outputs are used to compute CAM weights.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a large constant (1e5) for ablation, which is standard in interpretability but unusual outside this context.",
  "analysis": "The code manipulates model layers for interpretability, replacing layers with ablation variants and restoring them afterward. It uses a large negative constant to deactivate channels, a common technique in interpretability. No malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior is present. The layer replacement and batch processing are standard practices. The large constant does not pose a security risk but could cause side effects if misused. Overall, the code is benign and intended solely for visualization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate interpretability tool implementing AblationCAM. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The use of large constants is standard in this context. The scores are malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: approximately 0.1–0.2, reflecting minimal risk due to interpretability techniques.",
