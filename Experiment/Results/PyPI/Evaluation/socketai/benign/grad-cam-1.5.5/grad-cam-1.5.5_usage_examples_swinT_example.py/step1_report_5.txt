{
  "purpose": "The script is designed for generating class activation maps (CAM) on images using various CAM methods with a SwinTransformer model.",
  "sources": "Reads image file specified by '--image-path' argument and command-line arguments for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Uses the image data to generate and save a CAM image; no data leaks or untrusted data flows are apparent.",
  "flows": "Reads image from disk, processes it, and outputs an image file with CAM visualization. No external data flow to untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. All dependencies are standard machine learning libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code loads image data from a specified path, preprocesses it, applies a model, and generates a visualization using well-known CAM techniques. Usage of external libraries (cv2, numpy, torch, timm, pytorch_grad_cam) is legitimate for model interpretability. No network communication, no data exfiltration, and no suspicious logic are present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate implementation of CAM visualization for a SwinTransformer model. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
