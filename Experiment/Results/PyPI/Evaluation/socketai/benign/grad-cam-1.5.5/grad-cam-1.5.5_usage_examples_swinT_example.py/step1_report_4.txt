{
  "purpose": "This script performs visualization of model attention maps (CAMs) on images using various methods with a Swin Transformer model for interpretability.",
  "sources": "Input image path from command-line argument; model creation and weights loading; user-supplied arguments for method and device.",
  "sinks": "Generated CAM images saved to disk; no data transmitted externally; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input image is read from disk, processed, and passed into CAM generation functions; output is saved locally. No untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. Usage of standard libraries, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script uses open-source libraries (argparse, cv2, numpy, torch, timm, pytorch_grad_cam) for model interpretability visualization. All inputs are from user-specified image path and command-line arguments, with no external data fetching or communication. The code executes standard processing steps to load a model, process images, generate CAMs, and save results. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors were identified. The code appears to be intended solely for model interpretability tasks, utilizing well-known libraries and methods.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate model visualization tasks without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard implementation for explainability using CAM methods on a vision transformer model, with no indicators of malware or malicious intent.",
