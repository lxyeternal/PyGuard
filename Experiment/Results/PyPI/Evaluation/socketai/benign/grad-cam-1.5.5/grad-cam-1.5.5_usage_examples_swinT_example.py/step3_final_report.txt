{
  "purpose": "The code performs interpretability visualization using CAM methods on a Swin Transformer model, generating heatmaps for model explanations.",
  "sources": "Reads image file from disk specified by --image-path; loads model and input image data.",
  "sinks": "Saves the generated CAM visualization image locally; no external network communication or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Image file input -> model inference -> CAM computation -> visualization output file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The script loads an image, preprocesses it, applies various CAM methods on a pretrained Swin Transformer model, and saves the resulting heatmap image. It uses reputable libraries (timm, pytorch_grad_cam, cv2, numpy, torch). No network activity, external data transfer, or malicious code is present. The code is straightforward, with clear structure and no obfuscation. The minimal security concern relates to processing untrusted images, but this is typical for visualization scripts and does not constitute a vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for interpretability visualization, with no malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports is justified as a minimal concern over untrusted input but does not indicate actual malicious intent or vulnerability.",
