{
  "purpose": "The script generates Class Activation Maps (CAM) for images using various visualization methods on a Swin Transformer model.",
  "sources": "Reads input image file specified by --image-path argument, command-line arguments for method selection and CUDA usage, and model weights from the timm library.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; outputs a CAM image saved locally as a JPEG file.",
  "flows": "Input image is loaded and preprocessed; model is loaded and possibly moved to GPU; CAM methods are applied; resulting heatmap is overlaid on the image and saved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code primarily performs image processing and visualization without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard libraries for argument parsing, image processing, and deep learning model inference. It loads a pretrained Swin Transformer from the timm library, applies various CAM methods for visualization, and saves the output image locally. There are no code injection points, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms present. The code appears to be a legitimate visualization tool for interpretability of a computer vision model. No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for generating CAM visualizations using a pretrained model. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a benign visualization script intended for model interpretability.",
