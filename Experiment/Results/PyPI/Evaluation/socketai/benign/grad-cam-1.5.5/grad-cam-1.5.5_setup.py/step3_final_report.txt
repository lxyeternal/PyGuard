  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows; static file reads do not lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Static file reads during setup; no dynamic or external data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script utilizing 'setuptools'. It reads static files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with fixed metadata. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or obfuscated code. The code adheres to standard packaging practices and does not process untrusted input beyond static file reads. All signals indicate benign behavior. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The confidence level is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and justified. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
