{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'grad-cam' with metadata, dependencies, and package configuration for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies; retrieves package data through setuptools functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data; no network connections, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code are present.",
  "flows": "Data read from files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') flows into package configuration without processing untrusted input; no malicious data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed. The code is straightforward and typical of a setup.py script.",
  "analysis": "The code reads static files to gather description and dependencies, then configures package setup parameters with standard setuptools functions. No input validation issues, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns detected. The code's purpose is to prepare a package for distribution, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard Python package configuration with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any network operations, data collection, or code execution beyond standard setup procedures.",
