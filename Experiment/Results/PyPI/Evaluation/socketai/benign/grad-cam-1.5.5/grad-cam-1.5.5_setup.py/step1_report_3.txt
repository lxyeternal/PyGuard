{
  "purpose": "Set up and configure a Python package named 'grad-cam' for distribution, including reading dependencies and long description from files.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies; static package setup configuration.",
  "targets": "No untrusted input handling; no data is being processed from external sources at runtime that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration, no data flow from untrusted sources to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup procedures: reading files for description and requirements, and calling setuptools.setup() with static parameters. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or untrusted data handling is present. No indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or data leaks. All file reads are straightforward and do not process external input during execution beyond initial file reading.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard package initialization tasks without any suspicious operations.",
