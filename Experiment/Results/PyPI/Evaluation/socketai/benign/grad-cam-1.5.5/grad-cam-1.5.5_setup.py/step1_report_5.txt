{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'grad-cam' by reading metadata and dependencies from external files and configuring package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description and 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute untrusted data or cause harm are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') into the setup configuration, which then proceeds with package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code appears to perform standard package setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward package setup operations using setuptools. It reads files for description and requirements, then configures the package metadata, dependencies, and package inclusion. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data handling from untrusted sources is present. The process appears standard for Python packaging and contains no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads files and configures the package build process.",
