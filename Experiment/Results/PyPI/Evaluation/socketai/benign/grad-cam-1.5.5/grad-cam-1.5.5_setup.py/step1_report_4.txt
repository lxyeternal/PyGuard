{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'grad-cam', used to configure and install the package along with its dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md' for long description and 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; the script only reads files and calls setuptools.setup() with static and sourced data.",
  "flows": "Input data from files flows into the package setup process; no untrusted data flows into sensitive or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: reading documentation and requirements files, configuring package metadata, and invoking setuptools.setup(). All operations are typical for a package setup. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code adheres to best practices, and all external inputs are from local files. No obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply prepares the package for distribution.",
