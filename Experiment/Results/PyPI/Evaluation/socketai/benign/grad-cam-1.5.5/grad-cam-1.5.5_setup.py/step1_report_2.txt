{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'grad-cam', used for package distribution, specifying dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description and 'requirements.txt' for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows into security-critical functions or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') are read and used only for package metadata and dependencies, with no processing that could lead to malicious behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations using setuptools, reading files for description and dependencies, and configuring package metadata. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. It adheres to common practices for Python packaging and shows no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
