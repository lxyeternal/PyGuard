  "purpose": "Implementation of Grad-CAM++ for visual explanations of neural network decisions, specifically computing class activation weights.",
  "sources": "Input tensors, activations, and gradients during backpropagation within the get_cam_weights method.",
  "sinks": "Local computation only; no external data transmission or network activity.",
  "flows": "Source data (gradients, activations) flow through numpy calculations to produce weights used for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements the Grad-CAM++ algorithm as per the referenced paper, using numpy for array operations. It calculates the weights based on the gradients and activations, applying the formula with proper safeguards like epsilon to prevent division errors. The code is straightforward, with no external communication, obfuscation, or malicious logic. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk mostly 0) are consistent with the code's content. The slight securityRisk of 0.1 in one report appears overly cautious, given the benign nature of the implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of Grad-CAM++, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. It performs local mathematical computations for interpretability purposes and aligns with the referenced academic work.",
