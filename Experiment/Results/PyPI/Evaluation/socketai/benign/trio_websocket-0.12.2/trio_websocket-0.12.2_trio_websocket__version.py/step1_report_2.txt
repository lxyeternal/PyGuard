  "purpose": "The code assigns a version string to the variable __version__.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No output, data leak, or external interaction points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code is a simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no suspicious or unusual patterns; no secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines a version string variable. It does not perform any data processing, input/output, or external interactions. The content is straightforward and typical for package version declaration. There are no anomalies or signs of malicious activity. The code fragment alone indicates a standard version assignment, with no indicators of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of a version variable assignment. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and shows no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
