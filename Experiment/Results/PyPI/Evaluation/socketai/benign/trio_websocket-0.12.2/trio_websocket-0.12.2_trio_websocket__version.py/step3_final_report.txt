  "purpose": "Assign a version string to __version__ indicating the package version.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only assigns a string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows exist; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code is a simple assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal assignment of a version string to __version__, with no inputs, outputs, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string assignment with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is justified. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
