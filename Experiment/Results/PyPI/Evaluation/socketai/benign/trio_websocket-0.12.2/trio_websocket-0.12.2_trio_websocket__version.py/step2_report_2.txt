  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of the reported issues in the code:**\n   - All reports describe a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - The original code snippet confirms this: `__version__ = '0.12.2'`.\n   - There are no additional code constructs, inputs, outputs, or behaviors described.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that the code is a straightforward version assignment.\n   - No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - The code is benign; no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present.\n   - Therefore, higher risk scores are unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` as 0, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid assumptions; they correctly state that the code is a standard version declaration.\n   - No unwarranted claims are made.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and with the code content.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a minimal, standard version assignment with no malicious or suspicious characteristics.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\nAll reports are accurate, and the code is benign. The scoring aligns well with the content. No changes are necessary.",
