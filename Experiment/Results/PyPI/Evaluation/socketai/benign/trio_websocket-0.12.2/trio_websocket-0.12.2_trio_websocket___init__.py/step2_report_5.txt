  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements, re-exporting classes/functions from internal modules.\n- No data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution is involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The use of `# pylint: disable=useless-import-alias` appears to be a stylistic choice to suppress warnings, not an indicator of malicious intent.\n- The modules imported (`._impl` and `._version`) are internal, but their mere import does not imply malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code contains only import statements with aliasing (which are all identical to the original names).\n- No code execution, data flow, or external input handling is present.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious patterns are apparent.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The use of aliasing where the alias is identical to the original name is unnecessary; however, this is more of a stylistic or linting suppression issue, not a security concern.\n- Disabling pylint warnings for \"useless-import-alias\" may suggest the code is suppressing warnings about redundant code, but this does not impact security.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware:** All reports correctly assign `0`. No malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign `0`. No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk:** All reports assign `0` or very close to it, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- Since there's no evidence of malicious intent, no dynamic code, no external data handling, and no obfuscation, increasing scores would be unjustified.\n- The only reason to consider a non-zero security risk score would be if internal modules are compromised, but there's no evidence of that here.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent with each other, correctly assessing the benign nature.\n- The confidence levels are high (1 or 0.9), reflecting certainty about the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (consistent with reports)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (consistent with reports)  \n**Risk score:** 0 (no security risk evident)\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\nGiven the above, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a standard module re-export pattern with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n**Therefore, I assign:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is benign, safe, and typical for a package's `__init__.py` or module export file.",
