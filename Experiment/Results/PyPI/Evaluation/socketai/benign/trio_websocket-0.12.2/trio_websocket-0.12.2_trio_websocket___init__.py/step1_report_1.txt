{
  "purpose": "Re-exports of various classes and functions related to WebSocket connections and version info from internal modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules '._impl' and '._version', which likely contain the core implementation and version information.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; code only imports and re-exports functions and classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no runtime data handling or user input processing is visible.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import style with aliasing (though all aliases are identical to original names), and the disabling of pylint warnings for useless imports.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements that re-export symbols from internal modules. The aliasing used is superficial, and there are no operations, data handling, or function calls. No hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The disabling of pylint warnings suggests an attempt to suppress warnings about the imports, but this does not indicate malicious intent.\n\nThere are no signs of malware, backdoors, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The structure is typical for a package's __init__.py or a module re-export pattern, which is common and safe.\n\nGiven the lack of any data processing, external network operations, or potentially malicious code, this code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward re-export module for WebSocket-related classes and functions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply organizes imports for easier external use.",
