  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements from internal modules (`._impl` and `._version`) used to re-export classes and functions related to WebSocket handling.\n- No report indicates any data flow from untrusted sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code snippets are static, straightforward, and typical for module initialization or interface setup.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are noted.\n- The use of `# pylint: disable=useless-import-alias` appears to be a stylistic choice to suppress warnings about aliasing, not malicious.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- All reports assign a confidence of 1 (or close, 0.9 in one case), indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n- Malware scores are consistently 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Security risks are minimal, with some reports noting very low scores (0.1), likely due to the suppression comment or the internal nature of the imports.\n\n**Logical consistency and scoring:**\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0 or very low) are appropriate given the code's nature.\n- No report suggests any malicious intent, backdoors, or vulnerabilities based solely on these import statements.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound: the code is a benign re-export module, common in Python packages.\n\n**Potential concerns:**\n- The only slight anomaly is the `# pylint: disable=useless-import-alias`, which might suggest some superficial aliasing, but since all aliases are identical to the original names, it’s harmless.\n- No evidence supports claims of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code is a standard module re-export pattern, safe and typical.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Justification:**\n- The code is purely import/export statements, with no runtime data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns.\n- The internal modules are likely part of the package’s core implementation, not malicious components.\n- The suppression of pylint warnings does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThis code is a benign, standard module setup for re-exporting WebSocket-related classes and functions. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
