  "purpose": "Re-exporting WebSocket-related classes and functions from internal modules for package interface.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_impl and _version).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static imports do not process untrusted input or data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'pylint: disable=useless-import-alias' despite aliasing being redundant; no malicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements re-exporting classes and functions related to WebSocket handling and version info. There is no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing. The aliasing is redundant but harmless, and the pylint suppression is stylistic. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is typical for a package's __init__.py or interface module, with benign structure and intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign module re-export pattern with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0 and security risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
