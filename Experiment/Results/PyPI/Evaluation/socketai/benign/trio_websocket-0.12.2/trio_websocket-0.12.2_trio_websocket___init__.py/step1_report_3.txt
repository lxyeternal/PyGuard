{
  "purpose": "This code imports various classes and functions related to WebSocket connections and server handling from internal modules for use in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._impl and ._version.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked; the code only imports functions and classes.",
  "flows": "No data flows are established in this snippet; it only performs static imports without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The import statements are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements that organize and access components from internal modules. It does not include any dynamic execution, data handling, or network operations. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious activity, or security risks. The use of internal module imports is common in Python packages and does not inherently suggest malicious intent. Since no actual code execution or data processing occurs here, the likelihood of malicious behavior or security issues is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import block used for organizing access to internal components of a package. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a benign setup for a WebSocket-related module.",
