{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports various classes and functions related to WebSocket handling, connection management, and version information from internal implementation files.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (._impl and ._version), which are likely internal files of the package.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code solely performs import operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes and functions related to WebSocket communication and versioning from internal modules. These are standard import statements with explicit aliasing disabled. No data handling, network activity, or malicious patterns are observable. The code serves as a module interface for other components to utilize WebSocket functionalities. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement module for WebSocket-related classes and functions. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks.",
