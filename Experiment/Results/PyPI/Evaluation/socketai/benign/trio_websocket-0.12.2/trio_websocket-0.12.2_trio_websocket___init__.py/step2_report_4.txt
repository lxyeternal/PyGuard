  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a set of import statements re-exporting classes and functions from internal modules (`._impl` and `._version`).\n- All imports are straightforward, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code disables pylint warnings for \"useless-import-alias\" but aliases are identical to original names, indicating a stylistic choice rather than obfuscation.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Re-exports of WebSocket classes/functions and version info.\n- **Analysis:** No data flow, no sinks, no anomalies, benign structure.\n- **Score justification:** Malware score 0; security risk 0; confidence 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The report is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, re-exporting WebSocket components.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard import statements.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0; security risk 0; confidence 1.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate. No malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Similar import of WebSocket classes/functions.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic or malicious code; purely static imports.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0; security risk 0; confidence 1.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Re-exporting WebSocket-related functionalities.\n- **Analysis:** No data handling or malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0; security risk 0; confidence 1.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Importing WebSocket classes/functions and version info.\n- **Analysis:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk (0.1), but these are likely due to the use of `# pylint: disable=useless-import-alias`.\n- **Justification:** The code is a standard import module; no obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0; security risk 0.1 (probably due to stylistic suppression); confidence 0.9.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable, but the small security risk score could be reconsidered as negligible, given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0 or very close to 0, reflecting no security risk.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The only minor point is the security risk score in report 5, which could be set to 0, as the code is purely import statements with no security implications.\n- The scores are aligned with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign module setup for re-exporting WebSocket classes/functions. No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned are appropriate, with only a tiny consideration for the stylistic suppression in report 5, which does not imply any actual security concern.",
