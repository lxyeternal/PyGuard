  "purpose": "Re-exporting classes and functions from internal modules for external use, related to WebSocket connection handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing classes and functions from internal modules ('._impl' and '._version').",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to potential vulnerabilities; purely re-export statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code only defines module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; standard re-export pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports and re-exports multiple classes and functions from internal modules related to WebSocket operations. It also imports the package version. There are no dynamic code executions, user inputs, or data processing. The code appears to be a straightforward module interface setup with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as an interface for exporting internal WebSocket-related functionalities and version info. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a standard, safe module setup.",
