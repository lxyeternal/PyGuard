{
  "purpose": "This script sets up the packaging configuration for the 'trio-websocket' Python library, including metadata, dependencies, and versioning information.",
  "sources": "Reading the version from a file ('_version.py'), reading the README for long description, and defining setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and description, then uses this data to configure package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; the code is standard for a Python package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports setup functions, reads version info and README content, and configures package metadata and dependencies. It does not execute untrusted code, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data insecurely. The use of 'exec' to read the version is a common pattern in setup scripts, and the source files involved are local. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely reads local files and configures package installation parameters.",
