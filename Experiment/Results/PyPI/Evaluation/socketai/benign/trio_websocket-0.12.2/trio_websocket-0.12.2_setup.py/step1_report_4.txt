{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'trio-websocket' Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from 'trio_websocket/_version.py', reading README.md for long description, importing modules 'setuptools' and 'pathlib'.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data is written or used in a vulnerable manner.",
  "flows": "Version info read from file -> stored in 'version' dict; README content -> 'long_description'; package setup configured with metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic observed. No dynamic code execution beyond straightforward file reading and 'exec' for version info.",
  "analysis": "The script loads version information via 'exec', which could be a concern if the '_version.py' file contains malicious code. However, this is a common pattern in setup scripts and does not indicate malicious intent by itself. The rest of the script sets package metadata and dependencies, with no suspicious operations or data leaks. No code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. All dependencies are standard for package setup. The code follows typical Python packaging conventions and does not perform any network or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup configuration for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor concern is the use of 'exec' to load version info, which should be safe if the '_version.py' file is trusted. Overall, the script is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
