{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'trio-websocket', used to package and distribute the library.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from 'trio_websocket/_version.py', reads 'README.md' for long description, and gathers package dependencies and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no network or external data leaks initiated by this script.",
  "flows": "Reads version info and description files, then passes validated metadata and dependencies to 'setup()' for package creation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The script performs standard package setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The script loads version info dynamically from a local file, reads the project README, and configures package metadata for distribution. All operations are typical for Python package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code execution. No external network activity or data exfiltration is evident. The code is straightforward, modular, and free from anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It securely reads local files, sets up package metadata, and does not contain any malicious or suspicious code.",
