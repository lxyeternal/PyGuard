  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python project 'trio-websocket', defining metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'trio_websocket/_version.py' via exec(), reads README.md for description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration; no dynamic code execution beyond local files.",
  "flows": "exec() reads local version file; no external data flows or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to load version info, which could be risky if the version file is compromised, but common in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with typical patterns. It reads version info via exec(), which is common but assumes the version file is trusted. No suspicious code, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with this benign analysis. The main concern is the exec() pattern, but in a controlled environment, this is acceptable. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python setup configuration with no malicious activity or security issues. The use of exec() is typical and not inherently malicious if the version file is trusted. Overall, the code is safe, and the scores are appropriate.",
