  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided setup script and the associated reports:\n\n1. **Code Verification & Functionality**:\n   - The code reads the package version from `trio_websocket/_version.py` via `exec()`. This is a common pattern, assuming `_version.py` contains only a version string assignment, e.g., `__version__ = '1.0.0'`.\n   - It reads the `README.md` for the long description.\n   - It calls `setup()` with standard parameters: metadata, dependencies, classifiers, etc.\n   - No untrusted input handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution beyond the `exec()` of a local version file.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n2. **Analysis of Reports**:\n   - All reports agree that the script is a standard setup configuration.\n   - The primary concern is the use of `exec()` to load version info, which is typical but can be risky if `_version.py` is maliciously modified. However, this is a well-established pattern in setup scripts, assuming the local file is trusted.\n   - No signs of malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation.\n   - The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security risk: Very low (mostly 0.1 to 0.2)\n\n3. **Score Justification**:\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate; no malicious code or behavior detected.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0 is justified; code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the script.\n   - The confidence levels are high, given the standard nature of the script.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns & Recommendations**:\n   - The only minor point is the use of `exec()` for version loading. If `_version.py` is compromised, it could execute malicious code. However, this is a common pattern and, in a controlled environment, acceptable.\n   - No evidence suggests any malicious intent or behavior.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0.1 (reflecting the minimal concern about `exec()` usage, but generally safe)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe setup script is a typical, benign Python packaging script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The high confidence scores from the reports are justified. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is safe.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further action required.",
