  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the 'trio-websocket' Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'trio_websocket/_version.py' and description from 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reads version and description files, then passes data into setup(). No untrusted data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and reads version info via exec() from a local file, which is common for dynamic versioning. It loads README content for long description. The setup() function is used with typical parameters for package distribution. No suspicious code, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. All code appears to serve the purpose of package setup without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
