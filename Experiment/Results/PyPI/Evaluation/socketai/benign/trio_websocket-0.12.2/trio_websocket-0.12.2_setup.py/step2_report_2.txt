  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, their reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected across all reports.\n- The only minor concern is the use of `exec()` to load version info, which is common but can be risky if the version file is maliciously altered. However, in a controlled package environment, this is generally acceptable.\n- No external network activity, untrusted input handling, or data leaks are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code reads the version from `trio_websocket/_version.py` via `exec()`. If `_version.py` is compromised, malicious code could execute. But this is a standard pattern in setup scripts, assuming the source is trusted.\n- No other issues are present.\n\n### Flaws, errors, or mistakes:\n- The reports do not identify any logical errors or flaws.\n- The use of `exec()` is a potential security concern if the version file is untrusted, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- `securityRisk` scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.1–0.2), which seems appropriate given the context.\n- `obfuscated` is 0 in all cases, which is correct.\n- The `risk` scores are mostly around 0.2–0.3, reflecting minimal concern.\n\n**Are these scores reasonable?**\n- Yes. Given the code's nature, the scores are consistent and justified.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- The only reason to consider raising the risk score would be if the `_version.py` file is untrusted or compromised. But since the report states that the version is read from a local file, and no malicious activity is detected, a higher score isn't warranted.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Zero in all reports, which is correct. No malicious activity detected.\n\n### Potential assumptions:\n- The reports assume the version file is safe. This is reasonable, but in a more paranoid scenario, verifying the contents or avoiding `exec()` could be recommended.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2–0.3 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, due to `exec()` pattern, but standard practice)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. The only minor concern is the use of `exec()` for version loading, which is a common pattern but should be trusted.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed to the scores. The code is safe under normal assumptions.",
