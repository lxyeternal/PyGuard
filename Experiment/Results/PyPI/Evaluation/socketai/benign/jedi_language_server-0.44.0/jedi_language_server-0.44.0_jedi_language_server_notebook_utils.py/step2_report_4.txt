  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reported purpose, and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- Implements utility functions for handling notebook documents, coordinate mapping between notebook cells and a concatenated source, and integration with a language server.\n- Uses data structures like dictionaries, position/range conversions, and text edits.\n- No external network or file operations.\n- Focused on data transformations, position mapping, and server support.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### 1. **Purpose & Sources**\n- All reports correctly identify the purpose: utility functions for notebook document handling, coordinate mapping, and language server support.\n- Sources involve standard APIs, data structures, and workspace interactions, with no anomalies.\n\n#### 2. **Sinks & Flows**\n- The functions mainly transform data (positions, ranges, text edits) and pass them back into the language server or workspace.\n- No evidence of data being sent to external systems, network, or file systems.\n- The data flow is strictly within in-memory structures, with no dangerous operations.\n\n#### 3. **Anomalies & Analysis**\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns.\n- Usage of `attrs.evolve` is standard for immutable data updates.\n- The code does not perform code execution, dynamic imports, or any suspicious behavior.\n- The code appears to be standard, well-structured, and safe.\n\n#### 4. **Conclusion & Confidence**\n- All reports agree: the code is benign, safe, and intended for notebook and language server support.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), which aligns with the code's straightforward nature.\n\n---\n\n### Malware, Obfuscated, and Security Risk Scores:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. No malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, matching the code's clarity.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk due to data transformations, but no real security concern.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to the nature of data handling, but no real risk)\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the code's content.\n- No changes needed; the assessments are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a legitimate, well-structured utility module for notebook coordinate management within a language server context. It contains no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the minimal security risk is justified by its data transformation role.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code analysis.",
