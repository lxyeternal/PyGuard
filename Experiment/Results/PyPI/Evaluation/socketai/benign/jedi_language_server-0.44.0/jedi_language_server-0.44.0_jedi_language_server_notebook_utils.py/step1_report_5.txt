  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling notebook documents, including coordinate mapping, document editing, and server wrapping.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class initializations, and function parameters reading data such as notebook URI, cell URI, positions, and text edits.",
  "sinks": "Potential conversion functions that produce text edits, range conversions, and document source concatenation. No external data sinks like network or file system writes are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (URIs, positions, ranges) flow through mapping functions to convert between notebook and cell coordinates, and then back to document edits or locations.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears standard and primarily handles coordinate conversions and data transformations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are detected. The functions utilize safe data structures and checks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured set of utilities for notebook document handling, coordinate mapping, and server wrapping. It performs conversions and data grouping securely, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious logic. No external network activity, file system modifications, or sensitive data leaks are present. Functions include safe handling of optional values and proper type casting. Overall, the code seems benign and focused on functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utilities for notebook coordinate mapping and server handling with no indications of malicious intent. It does not contain any backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The primary purpose is to support notebook document management securely.",
