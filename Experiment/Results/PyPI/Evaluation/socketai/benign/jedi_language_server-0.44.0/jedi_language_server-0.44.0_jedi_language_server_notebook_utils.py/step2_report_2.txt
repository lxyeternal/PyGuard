  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions and classes for handling notebook documents, coordinate mapping, and language server integration.\n- No network operations, file manipulations, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The functions primarily perform data transformations, position/range conversions, and document edits within in-memory structures.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- The code relies on standard libraries, third-party packages, and established APIs.\n- The overall design aligns with typical notebook and language server utility modules.\n\n---\n\n### **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n\n- All reports assign a malware score of **0**, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated score is **0** in all reports, consistent with clear, readable code without obfuscation.\n\n### **Security Risk Scores:**\n\n- All reports assign a low security risk score (~0.1), justified by the fact that the code handles data transformations and does not perform external operations or handle sensitive data insecurely.\n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of Each Report:**\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for notebooks, coordinate mapping, and language server integration.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code; purely data handling.\n- **Score Justification:** No malicious behavior; low risk.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, utility functions for position/range mapping.\n- **Findings:** Straightforward implementation; no anomalies.\n- **Score Justification:** Safe, standard code.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility functions for notebook coordinate mapping.\n- **Findings:** Clear, standard implementation; no suspicious patterns.\n- **Score Justification:** No malicious behavior.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Notebook document handling and language server support.\n- **Findings:** Safe data transformations; no obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- **Score Justification:** Benign utility code.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Coordinate mapping and server wrapping utilities.\n- **Findings:** Standard, safe code; no malicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** No indicators of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment and Final Scores:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports — consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the low potential for security issues, a score of **0.1 to 0.2** seems appropriate, aligning with the reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Justification & Recommendations:**\n\n- The code is purely utility functions for notebook coordinate management within a language server context.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The low security risk score is justified by the absence of external operations or sensitive data mishandling.\n- The malware score remains at 0, as no malicious activity is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimate |\n|------------------|----------------|\n| Malware          | 0              |\n| Obfuscated       | 0              |\n| Security Risk    | 0.1 - 0.2      |\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is safe, standard, and intended for legitimate notebook and language server support purposes.",
