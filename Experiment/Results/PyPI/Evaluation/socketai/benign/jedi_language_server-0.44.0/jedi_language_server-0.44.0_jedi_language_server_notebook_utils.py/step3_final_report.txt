  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling notebook documents, coordinate mapping, and language server integration.",
  "sources": "In-memory data structures, position/range conversions, workspace and document APIs.",
  "sinks": "Data transformations within local structures; no external communication or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Coordinate conversions and document edits processed within functions; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network/file operations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility classes and functions for mapping notebook cell positions to a concatenated source, handling document edits, and integrating with a language server. It performs data transformations and coordinate conversions using standard libraries and APIs. No malicious patterns, external communications, or obfuscation are present. The logic is straightforward, well-structured, and purpose-driven for notebook support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, safe, and intended for legitimate notebook and language server support. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.",
