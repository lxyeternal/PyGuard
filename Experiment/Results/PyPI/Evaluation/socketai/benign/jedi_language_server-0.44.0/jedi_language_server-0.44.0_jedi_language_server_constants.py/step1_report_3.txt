  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data movement",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single constant assignment defining 'MAX_CONCURRENT_DEBOUNCE_CALLS' with a value of 10. It includes a descriptive comment explaining its purpose. There are no data inputs, outputs, or suspicious constructs present. The code appears to be a simple configuration constant with no potential for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward constant definition intended for configuration purposes. There are no signs of malicious intent, security issues, or obfuscation. It is safe and typical of configuration files.",
