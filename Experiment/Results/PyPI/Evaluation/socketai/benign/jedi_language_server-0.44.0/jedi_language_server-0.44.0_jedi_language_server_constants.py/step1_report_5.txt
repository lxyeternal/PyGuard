  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a constant integer value with a descriptive comment. No dynamic code execution, external data reading, or suspicious behavior observed. The constant appears to be used for controlling concurrency limits in a debounce decorator, which is a typical pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, straightforward, and appears to serve a configuration purpose without any malicious intent or security risks.",
