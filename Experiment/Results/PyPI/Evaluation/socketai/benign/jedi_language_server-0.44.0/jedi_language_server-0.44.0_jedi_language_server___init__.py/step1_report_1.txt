  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'jedi-language-server' package.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version function call, reading __version__ variable",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "Calling version() to assign package version to __version__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard usage of importlib.metadata for version retrieval",
  "analysis": "The code imports the version function from importlib.metadata to dynamically get the version of the package named 'jedi-language-server'. It then assigns this value to the __version__ variable. This is a common and safe pattern for obtaining package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activities such as data exfiltration or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, standard for package version retrieval, and contains no malicious intent or security issues.",
