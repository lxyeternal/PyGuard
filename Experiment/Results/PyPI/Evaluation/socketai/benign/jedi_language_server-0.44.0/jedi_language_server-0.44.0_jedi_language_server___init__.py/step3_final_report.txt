  "purpose": "Retrieve the package version information for 'jedi-language-server' using standard library functions.",
  "sources": "The function call to 'version(\"jedi-language-server\")' from 'importlib.metadata' retrieves package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or data sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output data beyond internal assignment.",
  "flows": "The source 'version(\"jedi-language-server\")' flows directly into the assignment of '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are detected; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'version' from 'importlib.metadata' and assigns the package's version string to '__version__'. All reports agree that this is a standard, benign pattern with no malicious intent. There are no data flows involving untrusted sources, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behaviors. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for retrieving package version info. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present. The current scores are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
