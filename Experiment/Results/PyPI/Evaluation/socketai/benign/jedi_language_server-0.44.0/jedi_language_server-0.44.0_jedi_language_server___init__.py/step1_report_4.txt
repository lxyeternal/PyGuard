{
  "purpose": "To retrieve and set the version of the 'jedi-language-server' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version using importlib.metadata.version() for 'jedi-language-server'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data; the code only assigns a version string to __version__.",
  "flows": "The source (importlib.metadata.version) provides version info that is assigned to __version__; no further data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no unusual or suspicious constructs. It simply retrieves package metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the version function from importlib.metadata to programmatically get the version of the 'jedi-language-server' package. It then assigns this version to the __version__ variable. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The purpose is to programmatically set the package's version identifier. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for setting a package version variable using package metadata. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks.",
