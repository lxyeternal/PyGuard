  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code's purpose is to retrieve and assign the package version.\n- The code uses `importlib.metadata.version()` to get the version string, which is a standard and safe approach.\n- No reports identify any anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- No data sinks, user input, or network operations are involved.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** All reports confirm that the code is straightforward, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected or suggested.\n- **Obfuscation:** None present.\n- **Security risks:** None identified.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in the reports. They all correctly interpret the code as a benign version retrieval pattern.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n\n### Critical analysis:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; all assessments are based on the code's actual behavior.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or lead to security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the provided code and reports, I concur that:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**This code is a standard, safe implementation for retrieving package version information.**\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- If I were to suggest any minor adjustments, it would be to note explicitly that this pattern is common and recommended for such purposes, but no changes are necessary here.\n- No further action is required since the code is benign.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, non-malicious, and free of obfuscation.\n- The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
