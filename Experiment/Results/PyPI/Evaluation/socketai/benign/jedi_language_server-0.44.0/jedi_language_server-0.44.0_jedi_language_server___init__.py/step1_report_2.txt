{
  "purpose": "The code aims to define the version of the 'jedi-language-server' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version information using importlib.metadata.version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing the version function to retrieving the version string of the package.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'version' function from importlib.metadata to programmatically obtain the package's version number. It then assigns this version to the __version__ variable. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not perform any operations beyond retrieving package metadata. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code. The simplicity and clarity of the code suggest it is a standard practice for version management in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for defining a package's version and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
