{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to convert Jedi refactoring objects into Language Server Protocol (LSP) text edits and renames, facilitating code refactoring and editing features in IDEs or editors.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from Jedi Refactoring objects, the original Python source code, and workspace text documents. It also accesses changed file data from Jedi ChangedFile objects.",
  "sinks": "The code generates LSP TextEdit, TextDocumentEdit, and RenameFile objects that could potentially modify files or rename resources based on refactoring data.",
  "flows": "Sources (refactoring data and original code) flow into functions like lsp_text_edits to generate text edits, which are then packaged into LSP objects for applying changes or renaming files.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain obfuscated elements or unusual dynamic execution. It uses standard libraries and conventional data structures without any hidden or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily transforms refactoring data into LSP-compatible formats. It validates Python syntax before applying text edits, reducing risk of malicious injections. No use of insecure functions, hardcoded credentials, or network operations is present. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured utility module. It does not perform any external network communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications beyond generating text edits and renames based on safe inputs. The functions rely on standard libraries and external API calls, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe, utility-oriented module designed to facilitate code refactoring and editing within an IDE or editor environment. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. Its security risk level is very low.",
