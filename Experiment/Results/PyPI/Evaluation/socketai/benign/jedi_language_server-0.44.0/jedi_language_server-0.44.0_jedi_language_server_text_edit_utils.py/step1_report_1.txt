  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting Jedi refactoring objects into Language Server Protocol (LSP) text edits and file operations, primarily for use in Python code editing tools.",
  "sources": "Reads include: 'refactoring.get_renames()', 'refactoring.get_changed_files()', 'changed_file.get_new_code()', and 'notebook_utils.notebook_coordinate_mapper()'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include: creation of 'RenameFile', 'TextDocumentEdit', and 'TextEdit' objects that could modify files or text documents.",
  "flows": "Source: Jedi refactoring methods or code source strings -> Processing functions (get_opcodes, lsp_text_edits) -> Output: LSP file and text edit objects, potentially affecting multiple files or code segments.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code relies on standard libraries and well-known APIs, with no unusual or obfuscated constructs. No evident malicious behavior or privacy violations.",
  "analysis": "The code converts Jedi refactoring objects into LSP-compatible text edits and file operations. It performs syntax validation, line/character position mappings, and processes diffs for code modifications. It interfaces with the 'notebook_utils' module for notebook handling, but no external data exfiltration, network activity, or system manipulation is evident. The use of standard libraries (ast, difflib, bisect) and known APIs suggests normal functionality without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for code editing tools, with no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. It performs standard operations for refactoring and text editing without involving external or suspicious actions.",
