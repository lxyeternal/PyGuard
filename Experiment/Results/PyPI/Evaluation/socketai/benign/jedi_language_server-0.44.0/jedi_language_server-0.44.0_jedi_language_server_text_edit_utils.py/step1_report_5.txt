  "purpose": "Utility functions to convert Jedi refactoring objects into TextEdit and related LSP structures for Python code editing.",
  "sources": "Input code strings, Jedi refactoring objects, workspace and document data, and file path URIs.",
  "sinks": "Generating text edits, renaming files, creating/deleting files, and obtaining positions within code.",
  "flows": "Input code and refactoring data -> parse and validate code -> generate opcodes -> convert to text edits or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Use of standard libraries and LSP/jedi utilities appears typical.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily facilitates translation of Jedi refactoring objects into LSP-compatible text edits and file operations. It includes syntactic validation with ast.parse, position calculations via bisect, and diff-based opcode generation. No external or network activity, no obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors are present. All functions and classes are standard for code editing and refactoring workflows. The code is well-structured, uses standard libraries, and does not perform any malicious actions. No suspicious data handling or security concerns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a safe utility layer for code refactoring and text editing within a Python language server environment. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
