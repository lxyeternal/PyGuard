{
  "purpose": "Utility functions to facilitate interaction between Jedi and Language Server Protocol (LSP), including code analysis, completion, and diagnostics.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (functools, inspect, sys, threading, ast), third-party modules (docstring_to_markdown, jedi, lsprotocol, pygls), and internal modules/constants.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink points include functions that generate diagnostics, resolve completions, and handle code snippets, but they do not contain suspicious untrusted data handling or external data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as code text, positions, and Jedi Name objects flow through functions that generate LSP diagnostics, symbols, and completions. Data like docstrings, signatures, and ranges are transformed into LSP-compatible formats.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. The code uses threading and async-like patterns safely. No evidence of system info leaks, network communication, or code injection. Exception handling is broad but appropriate for robustness, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for integrating Jedi static analysis with the LSP. It includes safe handling of position translation, diagnostic generation, completion sorting, and docstring conversion. There are no signs of obfuscated logic, malicious payloads, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code relies on standard Python threading, synchronization primitives, and Jedi's API, all within typical usage patterns. The functions mainly perform data transformation and formatting without unsafe operations or external network calls.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module designed for code analysis and editor support, with no indication of malicious behavior or sabotage. Its structure, functions, and data flows are consistent with safe development practices.",
