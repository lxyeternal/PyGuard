{
  "purpose": "Utility functions to interface between Jedi and the Language Server Protocol (LSP), including code navigation, completion, diagnostics, and documentation formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports standard libraries, Jedi API, typing modules, and project-specific constants and types. Reads source code from TextDocument instances.",
  "sinks": "Uses compile() to parse source code for syntax validation; processes data from Jedi (e.g., names, signatures, diagnostics); formats documentation and completion items for LSP responses.",
  "flows": "Reads source code via TextDocument -> processes with Jedi API functions (e.g., script(), get_signatures()) -> generates LSP responses (e.g., Range, Location, Diagnostic, CompletionItem) -> possibly uses cached completions for resolve.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external network calls detected. The only network-related activity is setting Jedi debug function (which only prints to stderr). No data leakage or exfiltration routines found. The code primarily deals with data formatting and Jedi API interactions, which are inherently safe.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly handles source code analysis and formatting for language server purposes. It includes a debounce mechanism, Jedi settings configuration, source-to-LSP conversions, and documentation formatting. All external interactions are limited to standard library, Jedi, and LSP types. No malicious logic such as network exfiltration, system manipulation, or backdoors is present. The only potentially risky operation is compile() within lsp_python_diagnostic, which is used for syntax validation; however, this is a standard practice and not malicious. The code does not execute untrusted code or perform any suspicious system operations. It appears to be a benign utility module designed for safe language tooling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a utility module for language server features, primarily handling data transformations and interactions with Jedi. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident. It employs safe practices and standard APIs for code analysis and formatting.",
