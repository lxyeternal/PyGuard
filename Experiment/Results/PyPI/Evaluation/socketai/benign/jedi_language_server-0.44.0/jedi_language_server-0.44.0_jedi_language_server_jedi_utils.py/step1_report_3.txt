  "purpose": "Utilities for working with Jedi, including conversions between Jedi types and LSP, debouncing, caching, and documentation formatting.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries (functools, inspect, sys, threading), third-party modules (jedi, lsprotocol, docstring_to_markdown), and constants/local modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the debug function print to sys.stderr, the use of compile for syntax checking, and various data transformations that involve untrusted data being inserted into LSP data structures.",
  "flows": "Input data from user or files flows into functions such as set_jedi_settings, script, lsp_range, lsp_location, and various formatting functions; these may involve parsing and converting data. Data flows from these functions into the creation of LSP diagnostics, locations, and completion items. There are no evident data exfiltration or command execution flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No backdoors or unusual code patterns are apparent. Usage of compile with user data could, in theory, be exploited for DoS via complex code, but it is a standard pattern for syntax validation. No dynamic code execution, eval, or exec present. The debug print function writes to stderr, but it is clearly marked as debugging and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly focused on converting data between Jedi and LSP representations, managing caches, and formatting documentation strings. The presence of a compile call for syntax checking is a common pattern. The debug function is simple and only outputs to stderr. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present. Data flows are typical for an LSP server extension. There are no signals of malicious intent, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration paths. The code is well-structured, and all data transformations are safe within the context of a server extension. No suspicious external connections or system commands are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured utility module for a Python language server extension, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It does not contain any malware or suspicious activity. Its security risk is minimal and within acceptable bounds for this type of application.",
