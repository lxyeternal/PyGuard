  "purpose": "Utility functions for Jedi and LSP interaction, including data transformations, syntax validation, and diagnostics.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from source code strings, Jedi API calls, and file paths; no external untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "Uses compile() for syntax validation; debug printing to stderr; no network or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Source code strings flow into compile() for syntax checking; Jedi API data flows into formatting and diagnostics functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of compile() for syntax validation is standard; no suspicious code injection or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of utility functions for language server features, with safe threading, standard exception handling, and no malicious logic. The compile() calls are for syntax validation, a common pattern in language tooling. No external network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated code are present. The debug print is harmless. Overall, the code is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured utility module for Jedi-LSP integration, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.",
