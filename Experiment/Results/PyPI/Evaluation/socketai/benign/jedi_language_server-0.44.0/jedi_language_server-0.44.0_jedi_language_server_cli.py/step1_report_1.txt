  "purpose": "Command line interface for the Jedi Language Server, allowing configuration of server mode and logging.",
  "sources": "Reads command line arguments and environment variables related to server configuration and logging.",
  "sinks": "Uses parsed arguments to start server processes (TCP, WebSocket, or stdio) via SERVER methods.",
  "flows": "Command line arguments -> configuration parameters -> SERVER.start_* methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard CLI pattern; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script processes user input via argparse, sets up logging, and initiates server modes based on user options. It performs input validation (e.g., mutually exclusive --tcp and --ws). All operations are confined to server startup procedures with no external data fetching or system modification. No hardcoded credentials or secret tokens are present. The code mainly handles configuration and starting server components. The server start methods are external; their behavior is not visible here, but assuming standard practices, no malicious behavior is implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI for starting a language server with configurable options. No signs of malicious or maliciously crafted code are present. It does not handle untrusted data beyond command line arguments, and all input validation appears normal. The script is safe for execution in a typical environment.",
