{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for the Jedi Language Server, enabling users to run it over stdio, TCP, or WebSocket protocols.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv` via argparse), user input for host and port options, and optional log file path.",
  "sinks": "Uses `logging.basicConfig` to output logs to either a file or stderr; starts server processes (`SERVER.start_tcp`, `SERVER.start_ws`, `SERVER.start_io`) which may handle network input.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments influence server startup method and logging configuration; server initiation functions handle network connections based on user options.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution; no obfuscated or suspicious language features. Logging configuration is standard.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a CLI for a language server with options for version info, network protocols, host/port configuration, and logging. Arguments are parsed securely; no user input is directly evaluated or executed as code. Server start functions are invoked based on flags, but their implementation is external and not part of this code. No suspicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI setup for a language server with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles user input appropriately and does not include harmful code or backdoors.",
