  "purpose": "CLI wrapper for starting a Jedi language server with configurable protocols and logging.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for version, protocol selection (--tcp, --ws), host, port, log file, verbosity; external server start methods.",
  "sinks": "External server start methods potentially initiating network connections; no direct untrusted data handling within this code.",
  "flows": "CLI args parsed -> validation (mutual exclusion) -> logging setup -> server start call based on args.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution. Proper validation of mutually exclusive options.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI interface that configures logging and delegates server startup to external methods. It performs validation and handles user input securely. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. External server methods are assumed safe, and no untrusted data is processed directly. The logic is correct, and no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure CLI wrapper with no malicious intent or obfuscation. It correctly manages input validation and logging, and delegates server startup safely. The risk and malware scores are justified as zero, with minimal security risk due to configuration logic only.",
