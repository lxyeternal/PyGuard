  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward CLI for starting a language server with options for stdio, TCP, or WebSocket modes.\n- The code handles argument parsing, validation (e.g., mutually exclusive --tcp and --ws), logging setup, and server startup via external methods (`SERVER.start_tcp`, `SERVER.start_ws`, `SERVER.start_io`).\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code is evident in the provided script.\n- No hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or data leaks are apparent.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic**\n\n- The code appears correct: argument validation is appropriate, and logging configuration is standard.\n- The only minor potential issue is that if `--version` is specified, the program prints version and exits—this is standard behavior.\n- No logical flaws or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: very low (0.1 to 0.2)\n  - Confidence: high (0.9 to 1)\n\nThese seem reasonable given the code's nature.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2; this is appropriate.\n- The code does invoke server start functions which handle network connections, but these are external and assumed safe.\n- Since no malicious behavior, backdoors, or dangerous operations are present, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n\n**Step 5: Malware score justification**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified because:\n  - No malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious network activity is present.\n  - The code only handles CLI argument parsing and delegates server startup to external modules.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- All reports correctly assume that the code is a standard CLI wrapper with no malicious intent.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are unjustified; the code appears safe.\n\n**Step 7: Consistency of scores**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, mainly related to network services, but controlled and external.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured CLI for starting a language server with configurable options. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure behavior is evident. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThese reflect the code's straightforward nature and lack of malicious intent.",
