  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step, considering the security implications, correctness, and consistency of the assessments.\n\n1. **Code Confirmation & Issues**:\n   - The code is a CLI wrapper for starting a language server over different protocols.\n   - It uses standard libraries (`argparse`, `logging`, `sys`) and external modules (`.server`) to initiate server modes.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - Input validation (mutually exclusive `--tcp` and `--ws`) is correctly implemented.\n   - No external data fetching or system modifications are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Reports**:\n   - All reports agree on the code's straightforwardness and lack of malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify that the server start methods are external and assumed safe.\n   - No report mentions any issues with input validation, logging, or configuration handling.\n   - No report suggests potential vulnerabilities such as command injection, insecure defaults, or data leaks.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware: 0\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Security Risk: Very low (mostly 0.1 or 0.2)\n   - These are reasonable given the code's nature.\n   - The code does not process untrusted data beyond CLI args; no network data is handled directly here.\n   - The server start functions are external; assuming they are implemented securely, the risk remains low.\n\n4. **Potential for Higher Risk Scores?**\n   - Since the code only handles configuration and server startup, with no evident malicious behavior, higher scores are unwarranted.\n   - The only concern could be if `SERVER.start_*` methods are insecure, but that is outside this code's scope.\n   - No signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions of vulnerabilities; they focus on code structure and logic.\n   - They do not overstate potential issues, maintaining a conservative and accurate assessment.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.\n   - Malware and obfuscated scores are 0, matching the analysis.\n   - Security risk scores are low, reflecting the safe handling of CLI arguments.\n\n7. **Overall Expert Estimate**:\n   - Malware score: **0** (no malicious activity or payloads)\n   - Obfuscated score: **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n   - Risk score: **0.1 to 0.2** (minimal, mostly configuration and startup logic)\n\n**Final Justification**:\n- The code is a standard CLI wrapper with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- It performs input validation correctly.\n- External server start methods are assumed safe.\n- No vulnerabilities are evident from the code itself.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n- The code is safe, with negligible security risk.\n\n**My Overall Scores**:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to network exposure potential if external server methods are insecure, but not evident here)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's safety and the appropriateness of the provided assessments.",
