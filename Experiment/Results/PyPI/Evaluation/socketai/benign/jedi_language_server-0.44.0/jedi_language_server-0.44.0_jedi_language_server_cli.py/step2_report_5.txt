  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a standard CLI wrapper for starting a language server with options for different protocols.\n   - It performs input validation (e.g., mutually exclusive --tcp and --ws).\n   - It sets up logging based on user input.\n   - It calls external server start methods (`start_tcp`, `start_ws`, `start_io`) with controlled parameters.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution observed.\n   - No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent with the code's straightforward nature.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is primarily configuration and delegation to external server modules.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The assessments about the absence of malicious behavior are justified given the code's simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - Security risk scores are low (0.1 to 0.2), appropriate for a CLI wrapper.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 0.95 or 1), justified by the straightforward analysis.\n\n4. **Potential for Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code does not process untrusted data beyond command-line arguments.\n   - The server start functions are external; assuming they are standard and safe.\n   - No evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n\n5. **Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - The reports assume external server methods are safe, which is reasonable.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or exploits are made; the analysis is cautious and appropriate.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's analysis.\n   - Malware scores of 0 are justified.\n   - Security risks are minimal.\n   - Obfuscated code is not present.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal risk, mainly related to network server startup, which is controlled via parameters.\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a typical CLI wrapper for starting a language server with configurable options. It performs necessary validation, logging setup, and delegates to external server methods presumed to be safe. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the risk is minimal. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified based on the code's content.",
