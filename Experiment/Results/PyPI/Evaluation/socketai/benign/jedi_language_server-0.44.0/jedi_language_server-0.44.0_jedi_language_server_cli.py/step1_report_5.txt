{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface for the Jedi language server, allowing it to be run over different communication protocols such as stdio, TCP, or websockets.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments parsed via argparse (e.g., --version, --tcp, --ws, --host, --port, --log-file, --verbose). Data is read from these arguments and environment configurations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include logging configuration (file or stderr) and server start functions (start_tcp, start_ws, start_io) which initiate network communication based on inputs.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are parsed and validated. Based on flags, the program may output version info, or start network servers (TCP, WebSocket, or stdio). The flows lead from argument parsing to server startup, with configuration influencing network behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are detected. Argument validation appears standard. No malicious behavior or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper for starting a language server with configurable transport protocols. It includes validation for incompatible options (--tcp and --ws) and logs configuration based on user input. No external data is retrieved or transmitted without explicit server functions being invoked. The code mainly handles user input and starts server instances accordingly, with no hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical CLI interface for a language server, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs input validation, logging setup, and server initialization securely. There are no suspicious flows or anomalies found.",
