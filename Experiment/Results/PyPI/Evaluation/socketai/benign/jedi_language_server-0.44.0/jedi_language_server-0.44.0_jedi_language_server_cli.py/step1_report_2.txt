{
  "purpose": "This code provides a command-line interface for the Jedi Language Server, allowing users to run the server over stdio, TCP, or WebSocket protocols with configurable options.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments parsed via argparse (e.g., --version, --tcp, --ws, --host, --port, --log-file, --verbose). No external data sources are read directly from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include logging configuration (file or stderr) and server start methods (start_tcp, start_ws, start_io). These methods could be security risks if they improperly handle network data or configuration, but in this code, they are invoked with controlled parameters.",
  "flows": "User inputs via command-line arguments are processed to determine server configuration. The flow leads from argument parsing to conditional server startup functions. No direct untrusted data flows into code injection or dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The code uses standard libraries and practices for CLI applications. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The script parses command-line options and configures logging accordingly. It prevents conflicting options (both --tcp and --ws). It configures server startup based on user input, with secure parameter passing. The use of argparse and standard logging practices suggests no obfuscation or malicious manipulation. All external interactions are controlled via command-line arguments, and no data leakage or malicious network activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI wrapper for starting a language server with configurable network options. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. It is a standard implementation with proper safeguards.",
