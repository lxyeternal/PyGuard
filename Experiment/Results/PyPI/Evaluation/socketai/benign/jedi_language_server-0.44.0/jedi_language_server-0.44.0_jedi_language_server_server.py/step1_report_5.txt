  "purpose": "Implementation of a Python language server using Jedi for code intelligence features, supporting capabilities like completion, hover, definition, references, diagnostics, and refactoring.",
  "sources": "Reads data from text documents, notebook cells, initialization options, workspace configuration, and client capabilities.",
  "sinks": "Uses Jedi scripts for code analysis, and calls functions that generate code actions, diagnostics, and refactoring changes, as well as publishing diagnostics and workspace edits.",
  "flows": "Input data (text documents, positions, configuration, notebook events) flows into Jedi script methods (e.g., complete, get_signatures, goto, infer). Results are transformed into LSP responses or diagnostics, then sent back to the client via publish_diagnostics, workspace edits, or feature responses.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code heavily relies on third-party libraries (jedi, pygls), but usage appears standard for language server functionality. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or suspicious data leakage detected. Diagnostic and refactoring functions are standard. No unusual or unexpected code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard language server architecture with typical features such as completion, hover, go-to, rename, diagnostics, and code actions, all using Jedi for static analysis. It includes event handling for document and notebook changes, with functions to publish and clear diagnostics. No parts of the code appear to perform malicious actions like data exfiltration, executing external commands, or network activity for malicious purposes. All data flow is confined to code analysis and LSP communication. The only potential concern is the use of Jedi's scripting and refactoring APIs, which are standard but can theoretically be exploited if Jedi contains vulnerabilities. However, within this context, their usage appears normal and safe. The code manages configuration and capabilities carefully, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard implementation of a Python language server utilizing Jedi for code intelligence features. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. The code functions as intended for a language server, with safe data handling and no suspicious network activity or security risks.",
