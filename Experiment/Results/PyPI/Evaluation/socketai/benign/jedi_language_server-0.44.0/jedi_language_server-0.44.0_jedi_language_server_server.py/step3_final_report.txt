{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python language server leveraging Jedi and pygls to provide features like completion, hover, go-to definitions, diagnostics, and refactoring within IDEs or editors.",
  "sources": "Reads initialization options, client capabilities, document contents, and Jedi analysis functions for features like completion, hover, references, and diagnostics.",
  "sinks": "Processes data from user requests into Jedi scripts and returns language features; no external or unsafe data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "User input (e.g., textDocument/hover, completion, definition) flows into Jedi analysis functions, which produce responses such as diagnostics, completions, or references.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected. Usage of standard libraries and patterns consistent with a typical language server.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured implementation of a Python language server based on Jedi and pygls. It registers features for code completion, hover, definitions, renaming, diagnostics, and refactoring. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The data flows are typical for such tools, with no external data exfiltration or backdoors. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.95), and the scores reflect the absence of malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a Python language server with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. It operates within expected parameters, and its security risk is minimal.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
