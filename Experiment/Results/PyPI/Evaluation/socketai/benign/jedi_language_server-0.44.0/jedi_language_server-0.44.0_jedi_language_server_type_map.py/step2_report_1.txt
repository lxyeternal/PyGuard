  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the security implications, potential issues, and consistency with the code.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code consists solely of static dictionaries mapping string identifiers to LSP enum members.\n- The functions perform simple dictionary lookups with default fallbacks.\n- No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The purpose appears to be a utility for mapping types in a language server or IDE context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and potential issues:\n\n**1. Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n**Yes.** All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward static mapping utility with no security issues.\n\n**2. Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning?**  \n**No.** The reports accurately describe the code's purpose, structure, and behavior. They correctly state that the code performs safe dictionary lookups with default fallbacks and no malicious or suspicious patterns.\n\n**3. Are the scores assigned reasonable?**  \n**Yes.** All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**4. Is the risk score justified?**  \n**Yes.** Since the code performs only benign static mappings, the risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**5. Is the malware score appropriate?**  \n**Yes.** No malware behavior is present; the malware score of 0 is correct.\n\n**6. Are there any assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n**No.** The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code.\n\n**7. Is the consistency maintained?**  \n**Yes.** All reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The functions default to returning `CompletionItemKind.Text` and `SymbolKind.Namespace` respectively if the input is unrecognized. These defaults are safe and standard.\n- The code's purpose is purely utility mapping, with no external dependencies or data inputs that could introduce security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risk identified.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is a benign, static utility with no security concerns.\n\n**Therefore, I assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, well-understood, and poses no security threat.",
