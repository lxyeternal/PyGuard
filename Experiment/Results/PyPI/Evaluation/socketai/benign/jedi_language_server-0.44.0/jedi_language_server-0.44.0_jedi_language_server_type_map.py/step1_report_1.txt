{
  "purpose": "Mapping Jedi API types to LSP completion and symbol kinds for code intelligence features.",
  "sources": "None; the code defines static dictionaries and functions without external input.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only returns values based on input parameters without performing any unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Input string parameters ('jedi_type') are used to retrieve values from dictionaries and returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward dictionary lookups with default fallbacks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific types from an external library and defines two dictionaries for mapping string types to LSP enumeration members. It includes two functions that retrieve the corresponding mapping, with default fallbacks to generic LSP types. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials or code injection vectors. The code appears to serve a static utility purpose for type mapping in an IDE or language server context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard static mapping utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs simple lookups and provides default values, which is safe. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
