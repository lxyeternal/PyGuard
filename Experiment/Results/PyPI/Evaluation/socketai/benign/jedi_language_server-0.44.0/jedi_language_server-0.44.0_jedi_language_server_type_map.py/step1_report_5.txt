  "purpose": "Define mappings from Jedi code analysis tool types to LSP (Language Server Protocol) types for code completion and symbol representation.",
  "sources": "Constant dictionaries (_JEDI_COMPLETION_TYPE_MAP, _JEDI_SYMBOL_TYPE_MAP), input parameter jedi_type in functions get_lsp_completion_type and get_lsp_symbol_type.",
  "sinks": "The functions return mapped types; no direct untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameter jedi_type flows into dictionary get method and then returns a mapped LSP type.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is straightforward, with explicit mappings and default return values.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple static mappings between Jedi types and LSP types via dictionaries. The functions always return a default value if the key isn't found, which is a safe fallback. There are no external data inputs, no network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to be a utility for type mapping with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility mapping Jedi analysis types to LSP types, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
