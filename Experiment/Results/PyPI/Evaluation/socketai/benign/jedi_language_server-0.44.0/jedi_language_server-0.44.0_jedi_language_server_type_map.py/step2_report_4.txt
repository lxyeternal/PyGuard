  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic Confirmation**:\n   - The code defines static dictionaries mapping Jedi API string types to LSP enum members for completion and symbol kinds.\n   - The functions `get_lsp_completion_type` and `get_lsp_symbol_type` retrieve the mapped enum based on input strings, defaulting to safe fallback values.\n   - There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or data manipulation—only static lookups.\n   - The code appears to serve as a utility module within a language server or IDE plugin context.\n\n2. **Security & Malware Assessment**:\n   - The code performs simple, static dictionary lookups with default fallbacks.\n   - No external data sources, network operations, or code execution are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code.\n   - No signs of malicious intent, such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n3. **Error, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes**:\n   - The default fallback values (`CompletionItemKind.Text` and `SymbolKind.Namespace`) are reasonable.\n   - The mappings seem appropriate; for example, \"module\" maps to `CompletionItemKind.Module` and `SymbolKind.Module`.\n   - No errors or exceptions are expected unless an invalid `jedi_type` is passed, but defaults handle that gracefully.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0 — No malicious behavior or code patterns.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0 — No security vulnerabilities or risky operations.\n   - The reports uniformly assign these scores as well, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n5. **Potential Claims & Assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly identify this as benign utility code.\n   - No assumptions about malicious behavior are justified given the code.\n\n6. **Consistency & Reasonableness of Scores**:\n   - The uniform scoring across reports (all 0s for malware, obfuscated, and risk) is appropriate.\n   - No reason to adjust these scores based on the provided code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 — The code is purely static, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 — The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score**: 0 — No security vulnerabilities or risky operations are present.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code is a standard utility for type mapping in a language server context.\n- No changes or warnings are necessary.\n- The uniformity of the reports and their conclusions is justified.\n\n**Overall, I agree with the provided assessments.**",
