  "purpose": "Mapping Jedi types to LSP types for code completion and symbol recognition.",
  "sources": "Constant dictionaries (_JEDI_COMPLETION_TYPE_MAP and _JEDI_SYMBOL_TYPE_MAP), function parameters (jedi_type).",
  "sinks": "Return statements that provide mapped LSP types based on input, used by other components for code intelligence features.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'jedi_type' flows into get_lsp_completion_type or get_lsp_symbol_type' functions, then accesses the respective dictionaries, and returns corresponding LSP type objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic behaviors are present. Usage of standard mapping patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides simple mappings between Jedi's type strings and Language Server Protocol (LSP) type enums. It uses predefined dictionaries for lookups and default return values if the input is unrecognized. Functions are straightforward and only perform dictionary lookups, which are safe. There are no external inputs, no code execution, no data leaks, and no suspicious logic. The purpose appears purely for type mapping within a code intelligence context. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for mapping Jedi types to LSP types, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
