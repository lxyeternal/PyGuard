  "purpose": "Mapping Jedi API types to corresponding LSP completion and symbol kinds for language server features.",
  "sources": "Static dictionaries _JEDI_COMPLETION_TYPE_MAP and _JEDI_SYMBOL_TYPE_MAP used within get_lsp_completion_type and get_lsp_symbol_type functions.",
  "sinks": "None; the functions perform simple dictionary lookups with default fallback values, no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "flows": "Input string 'jedi_type' flows into the functions, which retrieve the mapped enum from the dictionaries, defaulting if not found.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static mappings for Jedi types to LSP enums, with functions performing safe lookups and default fallbacks. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The purpose is utility-based, supporting language server features. The code is clear, simple, and free of malicious or suspicious behavior. Default fallback values are appropriate and safe. No vulnerabilities, obfuscation, or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static utility module for type mapping in a language server context. It poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The assigned malware score is 0, security risk score is 0, and obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
