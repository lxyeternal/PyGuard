  "purpose": "Map Jedi types to LSP types for code completion and symbol representation.",
  "sources": "Constants _JEDI_COMPLETION_TYPE_MAP and _JEDI_SYMBOL_TYPE_MAP, input parameter jedi_type in functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements in get_lsp_completion_type and get_lsp_symbol_type functions.",
  "flows": "Input jedi_type → get method on map → return mapped type or default.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two static mappings for Jedi to LSP types, which are used in functions that return corresponding types based on input. The functions default to safe fallback values if the input type isn't found. No data from untrusted sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, static type-mapping implementation with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger codebase for language server functionality and does not introduce security concerns.",
