  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists of static dictionaries and straightforward functions performing dictionary lookups with default fallbacks.\n   - No external inputs, dynamic code execution, or data leaks are present.\n   - The code serves a utility purpose for type mapping within a language server or IDE context.\n   - **Conclusion:** There are no issues or vulnerabilities in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is safe, static, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - They correctly identify the code's purpose and the absence of anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - **Note:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - confidence: 1\n   - These scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - **Suggestion:** No changes needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The code is purely static and utility-based.\n   - No signs of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n   - **Conclusion:** Risk scores should remain at 0.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - No malicious activity detected.\n   - The code does not perform any dynamic operations, network calls, or execute untrusted code.\n   - **Score of 0** is justified.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They acknowledge the static nature and safe purpose of the code.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - All reports are consistent and justified in their scoring.\n   - No discrepancies or unreasonable scores are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (No malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (Code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (No security risks identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign utility module with no security concerns.**",
