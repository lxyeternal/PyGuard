  "purpose": "Utility functions to interact with text documents in a language server environment, specifically for character retrieval and word range detection.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from 'document.lines' and 'document.word_at_position'. Uses 'position' as input for functions.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'document.lines' to access text content; no sinks that process untrusted data in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "Input 'document' and 'position' are used to retrieve characters and word ranges directly from document lines.",
  "anomalies": "The loop in 'current_word_range' has a fixed iteration count (1000) as a safeguard against infinite looping; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code safely reads characters before and after the cursor, and finds the word range at the cursor position. The only notable point is the 'for' loop with a maximum iteration count to prevent infinite loop, which is a standard safety measure. No malicious patterns, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are present. Usage of type hints and straightforward logic suggests routine utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs safe document text manipulations typical in language server implementations.",
