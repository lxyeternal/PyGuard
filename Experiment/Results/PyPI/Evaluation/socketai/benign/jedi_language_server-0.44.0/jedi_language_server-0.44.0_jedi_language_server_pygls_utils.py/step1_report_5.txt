  "purpose": "Utilities to work with pygls, specifically functions to interact with text documents and cursor positions.",
  "sources": "Reads document lines, cursor position, and word at position.",
  "sinks": "None detected; code does not process untrusted data in a way that leads to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Reads data from TextDocument (lines, word at position), processes position info, and returns character or range.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The loop with a maximum of 1000 iterations is a safeguard, not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper functions to retrieve characters before and after the cursor, and the word range under the cursor within a text document. It safely handles index errors by returning defaults or None. The loop in 'current_word_range' is a safeguard to prevent infinite loops, not malicious. No external network access, no code injection, no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions for text document processing within a language server context. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
