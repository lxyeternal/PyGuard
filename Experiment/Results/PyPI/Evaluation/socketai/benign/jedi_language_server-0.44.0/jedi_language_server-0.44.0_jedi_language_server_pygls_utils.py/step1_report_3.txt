  "purpose": "Utility functions to work with pygls for cursor position and word range detection.",
  "sources": "Reads from document.lines, document.word_at_position, and input parameters like position and document.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data leading to data leaks or system effects; mainly reads data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (document, position) flow into functions to retrieve characters and range info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. The code performs straightforward data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper functions for cursor position and word range detection in a text document. It reads character data from document.lines and uses document.word_at_position to determine words. The functions include exception handling for index errors. No external data is fetched, nor is there any network activity, code execution, or manipulation of environment variables. The logic is simple, procedural, and intended solely for document parsing. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for document parsing with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
