  "purpose": "Utility functions for working with the pygls language server protocol implementation, specifically for handling text documents and cursor positions.",
  "sources": "Reading data from 'document.lines' (text content), 'document.word_at_position' (word extraction).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "Reading character data from document.lines; computing word ranges based on document content.",
  "anomalies": "Loop with a hardcoded upper limit of 1000 iterations to prevent infinite looping; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper functions to access characters before and after the cursor and to determine the current word range. All operations are reading from the document object, which presumably contains safe text content. There are no inputs from external untrusted sources, and no data is sent over network or written to disk. The only potentially unusual element is the fixed loop limit, which is a defensive measure, not malicious. There is no code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for text processing within a language server context. It contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and performs safe read operations only.",
