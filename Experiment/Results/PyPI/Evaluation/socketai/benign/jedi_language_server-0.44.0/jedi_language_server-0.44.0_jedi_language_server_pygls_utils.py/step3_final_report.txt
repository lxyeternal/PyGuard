  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling text documents in a pygls language server, including character retrieval and word range detection.",
  "sources": "Reads characters from document.lines at specific positions, uses document.word_at_position() to identify current word.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions only perform read operations without external communication or data modification.",
  "flows": "Input: document lines and position; Output: characters before/after cursor, current word range.",
  "anomalies": "Use of fixed iteration limit (1000) in current_word_range to prevent infinite loops; standard defensive programming.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performs safe read-only operations, and includes a loop safeguard. No malicious code, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The fixed loop limit is a common safety measure, not an attack vector. All reports correctly assess the benign nature, assigning malware and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports' assessments are accurate; scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
