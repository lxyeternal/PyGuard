  "purpose": "Utility functions for working with pygls, specifically for handling text document characters and word ranges.",
  "sources": "Reads from TextDocument properties such as lines and word_at_position.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; functions are read-only and do not perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Input data from TextDocument (lines, word_at_position) flows through functions that process character positions and ranges.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is straightforward and primarily for utility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code provides helper functions to retrieve characters before and after the cursor, and to find the word range under the cursor. It handles potential index errors gracefully and includes a safeguard to prevent infinite loops in the word range detection. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity is evident. The functions do not perform any network operations, file system modifications, or access sensitive information.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for handling text document processing in pygls. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The functions are safe and serve a clear, benign purpose.",
