      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The minor use of 'open()' without a context manager does not constitute a security concern but could be improved for better coding practices. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this dependency is safe."

      "conclusion": "The dependency contains obfuscated code with dynamic execution features, raising suspicion of malicious intent. While no confirmed malicious payloads are detected, the obfuscation and code complexity justify a moderate to high security risk score. The scores are consistent with the observed features, and further dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm malicious behavior."

The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the slight security risk score reflects the inherent risks of subprocess execution, which are mitigated by input escaping. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."

The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero. The overall security posture is safe, with minimal inherent risks typical of external process invocation in testing frameworks."
