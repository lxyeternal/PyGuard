  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured pytest plugin for C++ test integration. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities within its scope. The main concern is external facade implementations, which are outside this review but are assumed safe. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose."
