{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module that imports libraries, defines functions, and possibly performs some operations based on the imported modules.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function arguments, environment variables, or external libraries used within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur at print statements, logging, network calls, or file writes if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to sinks such as network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code patterns, or unusual dynamic code execution observed. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of standard Python imports and function definitions. No evidence of malicious behavior such as system commands, network connections to suspicious domains, or data exfiltration routines. The structure and format indicate a typical open-source package module. Without specific operational details or runtime data, no malicious actions are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on static analysis, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a benign open-source dependency with standard coding practices. No security risks are identified at this point.",
