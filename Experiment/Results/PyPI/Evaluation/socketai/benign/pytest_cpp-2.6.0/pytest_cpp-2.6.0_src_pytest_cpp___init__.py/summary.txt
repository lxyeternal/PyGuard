  "conclusion": "The dependency contains obfuscated code with dynamic execution features, raising suspicion of malicious intent. While no confirmed malicious payloads are detected, the obfuscation and code complexity justify a moderate to high security risk score. The scores are consistent with the observed features, and further dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm malicious behavior."
