  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test harness component for BoostTest, with no malicious or obfuscated features. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to zero. The overall security posture is safe, with minimal inherent risks typical of external process invocation in testing frameworks."
