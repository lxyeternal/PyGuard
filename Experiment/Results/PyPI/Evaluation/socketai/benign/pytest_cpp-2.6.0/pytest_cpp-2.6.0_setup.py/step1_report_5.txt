  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the pytest-cpp Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst file for long_description, importing setup from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "Read README.rst content into long_description during setup execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without context manager; potential risk of file handle leaks, but no malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily configures package setup parameters, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It imports from standard libraries and reads a file without sanitization or external data processing. There are no suspicious behaviors such as network calls, code injection, or data exfiltration. The open() call could be improved with a context manager, but this is not malicious. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious instructions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
