{
  "purpose": "Configure and set up a Python package named 'pytest-cpp' for distribution, specifying metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Import statement for setuptools, setup() function call, reading README.rst file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no user input handling, no network or file writing involving untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; setup parameters are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the standard setuptools library and calls setup() with various static arguments to configure package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. It reads the long_description from a README.rst file, which is typical for Python package setup. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or other suspicious behaviors are present. The package configuration appears standard and benign, aimed at preparing a pytest plugin with C++ integration support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script without malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The script is safe for use.",
