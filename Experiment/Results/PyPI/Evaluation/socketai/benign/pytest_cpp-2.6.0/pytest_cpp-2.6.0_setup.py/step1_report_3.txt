  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package 'pytest-cpp' to facilitate C++ testing via pytest.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Reading the README file during setup to include as long_description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of open() without try-except or context manager; no other suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with package metadata. It reads 'README.rst' to populate 'long_description' but does not perform any dynamic code execution or handle untrusted input. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are present. No obfuscated code or malicious patterns are detected. The code appears standard for packaging a Python project, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package without malicious behavior. The only potential concern is reading a file without context management, which is benign in this context. Overall, there are no security issues or malicious activities detected.",
