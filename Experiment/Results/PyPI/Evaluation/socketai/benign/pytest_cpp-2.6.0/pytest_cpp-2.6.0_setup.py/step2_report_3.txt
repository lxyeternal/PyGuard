  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is a standard setup script with no malicious activity.\n- No suspicious data flows, sinks, or anomalies.\n- Confidence: 1, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.\n- **Assessment:** Completely benign. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, confirms standard packaging code.\n- No suspicious behavior or data handling.\n- Confidence: 1, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.\n- **Assessment:** Safe, standard code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Notes the use of `open()` without a context manager but considers it benign.\n- No malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but no malware or security risk.\n- **Assessment:** Still benign; the open() usage is a minor concern but not malicious.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to previous reports; no suspicious activity.\n- Confirms standard setup with no external data flows.\n- Confidence: 1, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0.\n- **Assessment:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Again, standard setup code with no malicious activity.\n- Notes the open() call without context manager but considers it non-malicious.\n- Confidence: 1, malware: 0.\n- **Assessment:** Safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** No.\n- **Suspicious behaviors:** None detected.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Security risks:** None identified.\n\n### Final Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (consistent across all reports)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** Given the benign nature, a score of 0.0 is appropriate, as there's no indication of security issues.\n\n### Justification:\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward, standard setup script.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or code injection.\n- The only minor concern is the `open()` without a context manager, which is a coding style issue, not a security risk.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus across all reports.",
