{
  "purpose": "This setup script is used to configure the packaging and distribution of the 'pytest-cpp' Python package, integrating C++ testing support with pytest.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.rst file for long_description; imports setuptools for package setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Reads the README file during setup; no data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs identified. Uses standard setup patterns and file reading.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup' with various package metadata parameters. It reads the 'README.rst' for long_description, which is typical in setup scripts. No external input processing, dynamic code execution, or network operations are present. All data is static or file-based configuration, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script for packaging. No malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation detected. The script performs typical package configuration tasks without external untrusted data processing.",
