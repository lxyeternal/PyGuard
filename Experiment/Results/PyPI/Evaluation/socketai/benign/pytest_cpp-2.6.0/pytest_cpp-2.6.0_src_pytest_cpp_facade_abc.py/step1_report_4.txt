{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for interfacing with C++ test frameworks, including methods for identifying test suites, listing tests, and running individual tests.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, abc module, typing module, and pytest_cpp.error.CppTestFailure.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no untrusted data sinks such as network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (executable, test_id, test_args, harness) are used within class methods to perform actions but are not processed in a way that leads to security risks or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no dynamic code execution. The code strictly defines an interface with no implementation details.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an abstract class with method signatures for testing frameworks. It imports standard modules and a specific error class. No data is read from untrusted sources or written to external locations. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The design is purely declarative, defining expected behaviors for subclasses.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a well-structured, non-malicious interface definition for C++ test framework interaction. It contains no signs of malware, security issues, or obfuscation. It appears safe and benign.",
