{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for test framework integration with methods to identify test suites, list tests, and run tests.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, abc, typing, and pytest_cpp.error; class method and instance method definitions",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data output or external system interaction present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; methods are abstract and meant to be implemented by subclasses",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; the code is standard for abstract class definition, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class with class and instance methods, serving as an interface for testing frameworks. It imports standard libraries and a specific error class from pytest_cpp. The methods are abstract, with descriptive docstrings, but contain no executable code or logic. No external data input handling, network calls, or file operations are present. The structure is clean and typical for interface definitions, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign abstract class interface for test framework integration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain security issues, or security risks. It simply sets up method signatures for subclasses to implement.",
