  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Findings**: Confirms the code is a straightforward abstract class with no executable logic, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - **Malware score**: 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Risk score**: 0 — no security risk identified.\n   - **Comments**: The reasoning is sound; the code is benign.\n\n2. **Report 2**:\n   - **Findings**: Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the code's role as an interface with no malicious patterns.\n   - **Malware score**: 0 — consistent.\n   - **Risk score**: 0 — no security issues.\n   - **Comments**: Well-justified; no concerns.\n\n3. **Report 3**:\n   - **Findings**: Again, confirms the code is an abstract interface with no executable or malicious behavior.\n   - **Malware score**: 0.\n   - **Risk score**: 0.\n   - **Comments**: Correct assessment.\n\n4. **Report 4**:\n   - **Findings**: Same conclusion; no suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n   - **Malware score**: 0.\n   - **Risk score**: 0.\n   - **Comments**: Appropriate.\n\n5. **Report 5**:\n   - **Findings**: Consistent with previous; purely an interface definition with no security concerns.\n   - **Malware score**: 0.\n   - **Risk score**: 0.\n   - **Comments**: Valid.\n\n**Overall assessment**:\n- The code in question is a standard abstract class used for defining an interface for C++ test frameworks.\n- No executable code, no data flows, no external calls, no obfuscation, and no signs of malicious activity.\n- The malware scores are correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low (0), given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final recommendation**:\n- The current scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes needed based on the provided analysis.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score**: 0 — no security risk present.\n\nThis code appears to be a safe, standard interface definition with no security concerns.",
