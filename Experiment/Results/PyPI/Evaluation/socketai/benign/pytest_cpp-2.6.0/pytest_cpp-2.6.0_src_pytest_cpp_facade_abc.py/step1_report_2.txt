{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for interacting with test frameworks, including methods for identifying test suites, listing tests, and running tests.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, abc, typing, and pytest_cpp.error; class and method definitions; docstrings.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks for untrusted data or external calls with user input; no network, file, or subprocess operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to vulnerable outputs; methods are abstract and meant for subclass implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be a standard abstract base class with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations for type hints, defines an abstract class 'AbstractFacade' with class and instance abstract methods related to test execution. All methods are purely interface definitions with no implementation, logic, or data processing. There are no hardcoded secrets, external calls, or complex control flows. The import from 'pytest_cpp.error' suggests integration with a C++ testing framework, but no malicious behavior or risky operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward abstract class defining an interface for test framework interaction. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a legitimate, safe component intended for extension.",
