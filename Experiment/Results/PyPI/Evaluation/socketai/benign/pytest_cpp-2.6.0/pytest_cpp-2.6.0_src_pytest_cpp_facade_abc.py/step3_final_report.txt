{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for C++ test framework integration, specifying methods for test detection, listing, and execution.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for executable paths, test IDs, and optional arguments; import of CppTestFailure class for test failure representation.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data handling or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "Method parameters flow into abstract method definitions; no runtime data flow or external calls occur within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward abstract class with no executable logic, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pure interface with no implementation or data processing. It imports standard modules and a specific exception class but does not perform any operations. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign, structural nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe interface definition for test framework integration. It contains no executable logic, external interactions, or malicious patterns. The assigned security scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
