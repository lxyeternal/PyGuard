{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class for interfacing with C++ test frameworks, providing methods to identify test suites, list tests, and run individual tests.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading beyond method parameters which are typical for function calls).",
  "sinks": "None (no data sinks or external outputs or data exfiltration points are present).",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines abstract methods with no implementation, so no data flows are established.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code is straightforward and typical for an abstract class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class using Python's ABC module, with abstract methods intended to be overridden in subclasses. It imports modules and a specific exception class but does not execute or instantiate any code. There are no dynamic code execution, network access, or data manipulation in this snippet. The methods are well-documented and do not perform any operations themselves. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard abstract class declaration intended for defining an interface to C++ test frameworks. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, or security concerns. Based solely on this code, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
