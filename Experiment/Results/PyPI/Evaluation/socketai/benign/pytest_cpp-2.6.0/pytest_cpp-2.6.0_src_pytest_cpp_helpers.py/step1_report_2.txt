  "purpose": "Constructs a command line list by combining harness, executable, and optional arguments.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'harness', 'executable', and 'arg' sequences.",
  "sinks": "Return value, which is a list of command components; potential misuse if misused in subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the return statement, concatenating sequences to form a command list.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, and no dynamic execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The function simply combines provided sequences into a single list representing a command line. It uses unpacking to merge sequences, which is standard. There are no input validation checks, but given the purpose, this is not inherently suspicious. No code injection, external network, or system modifications are present. The code appears to be a straightforward utility function to prepare command-line arguments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for assembling command line arguments, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
