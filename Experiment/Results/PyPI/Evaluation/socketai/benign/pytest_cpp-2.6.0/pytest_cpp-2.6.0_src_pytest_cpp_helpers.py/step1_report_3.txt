  "purpose": "Constructs a command line argument list by combining harness, executable, and optional arguments.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'harness' (sequence of strings), 'executable' (string), 'arg' (optional sequence of strings).",
  "sinks": "Return statement creating a list of strings; no direct sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the list construction, returning a combined list of command components.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The function performs straightforward list concatenation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that takes sequences of strings and an executable name, then returns a combined list. It uses unpacking to merge the sequences. There are no external data reads, no dynamic execution, or network activity. The function is simple and appears to serve a utility purpose of preparing command-line arguments. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function for command-line argument assembly. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
