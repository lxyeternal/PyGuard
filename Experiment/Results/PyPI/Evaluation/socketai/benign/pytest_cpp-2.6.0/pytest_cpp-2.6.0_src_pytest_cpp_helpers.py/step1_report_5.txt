  "purpose": "Constructs a command line list by combining a harness, executable, and optional arguments.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: harness (Sequence[str]), executable (str), arg (Sequence[str], default empty).",
  "sinks": "The returned list could be used as a command to execute, but no direct sink is present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are combined into a list; potential execution could occur later if this list is passed to subprocess or similar functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the function performs straightforward list concatenation without any suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The function takes three parameters, with defaults, and returns a combined list representing command line arguments. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, backdoors, or hidden operations. It merely concatenates provided sequences and strings. The code is clean, simple, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function for command line construction. It does not contain malware or security risks.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
