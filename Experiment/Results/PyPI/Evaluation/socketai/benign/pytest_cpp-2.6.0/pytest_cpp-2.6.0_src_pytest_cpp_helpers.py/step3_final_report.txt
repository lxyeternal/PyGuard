  "purpose": "Utility function to assemble command-line argument list by concatenating sequences and strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'harness' (sequence of strings), 'executable' (string), 'arg' (sequence of strings).",
  "sinks": "The output list is used as command-line arguments; potential misuse if downstream code executes these arguments without validation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are combined into a list; downstream processes may execute or utilize this list, risking command injection if inputs are untrusted.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward concatenation without obfuscation, secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility that concatenates provided sequences and strings into a list for command execution. It does not perform validation, sanitization, or execution itself. The function's safety is high; the main concern is downstream usage with untrusted inputs, which could lead to command injection if not properly handled. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are appropriate given the context. The overall risk is minimal and primarily depends on external usage. The code is benign and structurally sound.",
  "conclusion": "The function is a benign utility for constructing command-line argument lists. It contains no malware or obfuscation. The potential security risk is external and depends on how the output is used, not on the code itself. The scores and assessments in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
