{
  "purpose": "The code provides classes and functions to represent, format, and display C++ test failures, including retrieving code context around failure lines from files.",
  "sources": "File I/O in get_code_context_around_line function, specifically reading lines from a file.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is sent over the network, executed dynamically, or written to sensitive locations beyond reading local files for context.",
  "flows": "File reading in get_code_context_around_line flows from filename input to reading lines for context display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code uses standard libraries and typical file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines exception classes, data structures, and display logic for test failures in C++. It reads file content to provide context around failure lines, which is a standard operation. No untrusted data sources, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The file reading is straightforward, with no evident risks. The code does not contain malicious or suspicious behavior, and the only external interaction is local file reading for displaying error context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for formatting and displaying test failures with file context, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The file I/O is limited to local reads for error reporting purposes. No vulnerabilities or malicious activities are detected.",
