  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation for reporting C++ test failures with source context. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The only minor security concern is reading files based on untrusted filenames, which is typical for debugging utilities. The scores are justified and appropriate given the code's behavior."
