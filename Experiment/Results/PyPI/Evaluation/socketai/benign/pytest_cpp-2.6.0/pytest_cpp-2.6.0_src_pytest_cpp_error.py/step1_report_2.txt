{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for representing, formatting, and displaying C++ test failure information in pytest, including retrieving code context from files.",
  "sources": "File system access in get_code_context_around_line (reads files based on filename), no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or untrusted data handling that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "File reading in get_code_context_around_line flows from filename input to reading file lines for context display.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors. All operations are straightforward file I/O and formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code is focused on formatting and displaying test failure details, with file reading operations to extract code snippets for context. It imports modules for exception handling, typing, and string processing, but uses standard, safe functions. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution outside of normal file reading is present. The code appears to be a part of a test reporting tool with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It performs safe file I/O and formatting for test failure reports. No malicious signals or anomalies are detected.",
