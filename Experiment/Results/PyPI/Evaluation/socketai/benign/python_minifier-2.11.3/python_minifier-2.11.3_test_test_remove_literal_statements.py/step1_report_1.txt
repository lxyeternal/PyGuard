{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions to remove literal statements from Python source code using AST manipulation and includes test cases to verify the functionality of literal removal.",
  "sources": "The code reads source code strings in the functions 'remove_literals' and the test cases, primarily through the 'source' variables and the 'ast.parse' calls.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or harmful effects. No external data output or network communication is present.",
  "flows": "The source data flows into AST parsing functions, then through AST transformation classes (like RemoveLiteralStatements), but no untrusted data reaches any dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are observed. The code performs standard AST parsing, transformation, and testing routines. No obfuscated or malicious code structures detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules for AST manipulation and performs operations to remove literals from source code. It defines a function to parse source, modify the AST to remove literals, and then compare the transformed AST to expected outcomes via test functions. The test cases check the removal of numeric and string literals, including a more complex function with docstrings and literals. All functions and operations appear straightforward and typical for code transformation tools. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code solely manipulates ASTs for the purpose of code transformation, with no external communications or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for AST-based literal removal with corresponding tests. There is no indication of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks within this module.",
