{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions to parse Python source code into an AST, annotate it, and remove literal statements (strings, numbers) using the RemoveLiteralStatements class, primarily for code normalization or analysis.",
  "sources": "AST parsing and annotation points, including the initial ast.parse call and the RemoveLiteralStatements transformation.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data, perform network I/O, or write to files.",
  "flows": "Input source code -> AST parsing -> AST annotation -> RemoveLiteralStatements transformation -> output AST with literals removed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AST parsing and transformation to remove literals, with accompanying tests verifying functionality. No external data flows, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The purpose appears to be code cleanup or analysis. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and very low security risk scores. The only minor discrepancy is in the last report's security risk score of 0.1, which is slightly overcautious given the benign code; it should be 0. for consistency. Confidence in these conclusions is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, straightforward AST-based utility for removing literals from Python code. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. All reports are accurate; the minor security risk score in the last report can be lowered to 0 for consistency.",
