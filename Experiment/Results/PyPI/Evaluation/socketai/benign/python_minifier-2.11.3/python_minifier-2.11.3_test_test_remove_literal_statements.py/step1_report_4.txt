{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions to parse and process Python source code by removing literal statements and strings, primarily for code analysis or transformation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads Python source code as input parameter in remove_literals(source).",
  "sinks": "Uses AST parsing and transformation functions that manipulate the AST structure; no direct sinks for untrusted data or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "Source (source code string) -> AST parsing -> AST transformations (add_parent, add_namespace, bind_names, resolve_names, RemoveLiteralStatements) -> Output AST.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs detected. No dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns observed. The code is straightforward and utilizes known libraries for AST transformations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules for AST manipulation and code transformation, then defines functions to parse source code, annotate, and remove literal statements using RemoveLiteralStatements. The test functions evaluate removal of literals from sample code snippets. The overall structure and library usage are standard for code transformation. No suspicious behavior, such as network calls, data leaks, or obfuscation, is evident. The focus is on safe code analysis, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for processing Python code to remove literals. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It strictly performs AST-based transformations with no external data flows or malicious operations.",
