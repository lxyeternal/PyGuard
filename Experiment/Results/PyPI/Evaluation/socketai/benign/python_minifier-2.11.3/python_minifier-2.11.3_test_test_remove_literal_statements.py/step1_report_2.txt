{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions to parse Python source code, annotate its AST, and remove literal statements, primarily for code normalization or cleanup.",
  "sources": "The source code is taken as input in the 'remove_literals' function; the 'source' parameter in test functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any sinks that send data externally or perform malicious actions. No data leaks or untrusted data flows are apparent.",
  "flows": "The flow involves parsing source code into AST, annotating it, and removing literal statements; no external or untrusted data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code performs straightforward AST manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific modules for AST processing and defines functions for removing literal statements from source code. The functions utilize AST parsing and annotation, then apply a removal transformation. The test functions check the removal of numeric and string literals and a more complex code snippet. All operations are standard AST processing, with no signs of malicious activity or suspicious code patterns. No external network, file I/O, or sensitive data handling is present. The code appears to be a utility for code sanitization or transformation, likely intended for code analysis or modification workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for AST-based literal removal with no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It operates solely on code structure without external interactions.",
