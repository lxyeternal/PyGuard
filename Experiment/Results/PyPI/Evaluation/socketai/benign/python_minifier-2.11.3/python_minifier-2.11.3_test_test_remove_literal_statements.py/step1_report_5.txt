{
  "purpose": "This code defines functions to parse Python source code, annotate the AST, and remove literal statements (such as strings and numbers) from the AST. It also includes test functions that verify the removal of literals in various cases.",
  "sources": "The code reads input source code strings in the test functions and the remove_literals function, which parses the source code into an AST.",
  "sinks": "The code processes the AST and outputs modified ASTs after removing literals. It does not appear to write data or perform external communications.",
  "flows": "Source input source code -> parse into AST -> annotate AST -> remove literals -> output modified AST",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The functions perform straightforward AST processing. No obfuscated code, network activity, or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports various AST manipulation modules, applies a series of transformations to parse and annotate the AST, then removes literals from the AST nodes using RemoveLiteralStatements(). The test cases verify that string and numeric literals are correctly removed, leaving code with only code statements and function definitions. The code appears to serve a code cleanup or obfuscation task, with no evidence of malicious behavior or external side-effects. All processing is confined to AST transformations, with no data exfiltration, network activity, or harmful code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for processing and cleaning Python code by removing literals. It does not exhibit any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a safe code transformation utility.",
