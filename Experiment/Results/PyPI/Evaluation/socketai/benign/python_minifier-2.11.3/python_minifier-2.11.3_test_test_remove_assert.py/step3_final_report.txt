  "purpose": "A utility to remove 'assert' statements from Python source code using AST transformations.",
  "sources": "Input source code strings, including assertions, classes, functions, and control structures.",
  "sinks": "Modified AST nodes where assertions are removed or replaced, affecting code structure.",
  "flows": "Source code is parsed into AST, assertions are identified as sinks, and transformed accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "Assertions replaced with '0' or removed; no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard AST parsing and transformation to remove assertions. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Test cases confirm correctness. The transformation could impact program logic but does not introduce security risks. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility for assertion removal with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The slight risk score accounts for potential impact on program logic but does not indicate security threats.",
