  "purpose": "This code defines functions and test cases to remove assert statements from Python source code using AST transformations.",
  "sources": "Reading source code via the 'source' string parameter in the 'remove_asserts' function and the test cases.",
  "sinks": "AST transformations and modifications, but no direct data leakage or malicious data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Source (source code string) -> AST parsing -> AST transformations (add_parent, add_namespace, bind_names, resolve_names) -> RemoveAsserts() transformation -> output AST.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors detected. The code performs standard AST modifications. No obfuscated code or hidden malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules related to AST manipulation and assertion removal. It defines a function 'remove_asserts' that processes source code through multiple AST transformation steps before removing assert statements. Several test functions verify the correctness of the 'remove_asserts' function with different code snippets, including classes, functions, conditionals, and assertions. All operations are consistent with source code sanitization or transformation, with no evidence of malicious intent. The code appears to be for code cleaning or analysis purposes, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for removing assertions from Python code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code snippet. It is a standard code transformation utility with no embedded malware.",
