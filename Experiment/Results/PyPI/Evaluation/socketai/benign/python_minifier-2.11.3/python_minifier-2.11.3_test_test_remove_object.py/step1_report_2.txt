{
  "purpose": "The code defines test functions for a Python AST transformation class RemoveObject, which removes 'object' base class in Python 3 class definitions for compatibility or simplification.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded source code strings defining Python classes and system version info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "The code processes AST objects; no sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "AST parsing of source code strings -> applying RemoveObject transformation -> comparing with expected ASTs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs standard testing procedures with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines test functions that manipulate Python class definitions to test the RemoveObject transformation. It conditionally skips tests based on Python version to ensure compatibility. The code compares the transformed ASTs to expected ASTs for correctness. The overall structure is typical for unit tests, with no signs of malicious code or malicious behavior. No input/output data beyond test code strings or system info are handled, and there are no suspicious data flows or malicious sinks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of unit tests for a code transformation class, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply processes and compares ASTs of Python class definitions, which is a standard testing practice.",
