{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for the RemoveObject AST transformer, verifying its behavior across Python versions by parsing source snippets, applying transformations, and comparing ASTs.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded source code strings within test functions, AST parsing, and transformation calls.",
  "sinks": "None; internal AST processing without external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Source code strings are parsed into ASTs, transformed by RemoveObject, and compared; no untrusted data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, well-structured test code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AST transformations and comparisons, with version-specific test skips. It does not handle external input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with its benign, testing nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, clear, and intended solely for testing AST transformations. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. All reports correctly assess the code as benign, with no security concerns.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
