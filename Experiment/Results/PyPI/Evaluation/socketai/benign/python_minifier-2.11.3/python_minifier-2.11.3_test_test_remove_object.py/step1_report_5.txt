{
  "purpose": "This code contains test functions for a Python AST transformation that removes 'object' from class base lists where applicable.",
  "sources": "Input source code strings within the test functions, specifically the 'source' variables holding class definitions.",
  "sinks": "AST parsing and transformation functions, such as ast.parse() and RemoveObject(), which process the source code.",
  "flows": "Source code strings are parsed into ASTs, transformed by RemoveObject(), and then compared to expected ASTs; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code relies on standard AST manipulation and testing frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python modules (ast, sys) and a testing framework (pytest). It defines test functions that verify the behavior of the RemoveObject transformation. The tests check for removal of 'object' in class definitions on Python 3, and ensure no removal occurs on Python 2. The source code snippets are static and used solely for testing purposes. The code uses standard AST parsing and comparison methods, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of test cases for a safe AST transformation utility. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be well-structured testing code targeting a specific transformation functionality.",
