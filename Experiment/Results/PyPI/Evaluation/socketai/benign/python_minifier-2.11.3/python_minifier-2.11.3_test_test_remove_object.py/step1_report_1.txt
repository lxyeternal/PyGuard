{
  "purpose": "The code contains tests for the RemoveObject AST transformer to verify its behavior on class definitions across Python 2 and 3.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (ast, sys, pytest, python_minifier modules) and defines test functions that process Python source code strings.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling evident; the code performs AST transformations and comparisons within a test framework.",
  "flows": "The code reads source code strings, parses them into ASTs, applies transformations, and compares ASTs for expected behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected. The code is straightforward test code for AST manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines test functions to verify the RemoveObject AST transformer. It skips tests based on Python version, processes source code snippets representing class definitions, and compares transformed ASTs to expected ASTs. The code relies on standard libraries and a custom AST comparison tool. No external data handling, no malicious logic, or suspicious behaviors are present. The use of sys.version_info for version-specific tests is standard. The code’s purpose is solely to validate AST transformations in a controlled testing environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard test code for an AST transformer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs safe parsing and comparison of Python code snippets within a testing framework. There are no indicators of supply chain attacks or malware.",
