  "purpose": "Static test functions for a namespace analysis tool, verifying namespace resolution in various Python constructs (functions, classes, comprehensions, etc.) primarily for Python 2.",
  "sources": "Code snippets embedded as strings within test functions, used as input for namespace assertions.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network, or system modifications; internal assertions only.",
  "flows": "Static code snippets analyzed for namespace structure; no data flow beyond internal static analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns; standard use of version checks and static assertions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of static, well-structured test cases for a namespace analysis utility. It does not perform any external I/O, network communication, or system modifications. The code snippets are static strings used solely for analysis. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk near zero) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The code's purpose is validation of namespace resolution, not execution or data manipulation, further supporting the conclusion of no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static test suite for namespace analysis with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
