  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code and considering the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a set of test functions for AST manipulation related to import statements and namespace analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous sinks or data flows are present; only static source code parsing and AST transformations.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious or malicious code behaviors. The code is focused on testing, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment is accurate. The code is benign, with a high confidence level.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No changes needed. Malware score remains **0**; risk score remains **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code is a test suite for AST-based import handling and namespace management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or dangerous data sinks. The code only manipulates ASTs and prints results.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious patterns or malicious code. The focus is on code transformation validation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion is appropriate, with a very high confidence level.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No changes needed. Malware score **0**; risk score **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; test functions for import and namespace AST transformations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data processing beyond static AST manipulation.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No signs of malicious behavior; purely static analysis code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No changes needed. Malware **0**; risk **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Recognizes the code as a test suite for import and namespace analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data sinks or execution of untrusted code.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No suspicious activity detected; the code is static and for testing.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate assessment.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No changes needed. Malware **0**; risk **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes that the code parses source code, manipulates imports, and inspects namespace structures.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or dangerous data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Logic:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent; purely static AST processing.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid and accurate.\n\n**Score Adjustment:** No changes needed. Malware **0**; risk **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is solely for static AST analysis and testing.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any malicious or risky behavior, the risk score should remain at **0**.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n| 0          | 0            | 0      |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code is a benign, well-structured test suite for Python AST import and namespace manipulation. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present. The scores should remain at zero across all categories.",
