{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of test functions for analyzing and transforming Python Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) related to import statements and namespace management, primarily for static code analysis or refactoring validation.",
  "sources": "Static source code snippets within test functions; external modules for AST manipulation (helpers, python_minifier components).",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; all operations are confined to parsing, transforming, and comparing ASTs in memory.",
  "flows": "Parsing source code -> AST transformations (add_parent, add_namespace, combine_imports, bind_names, resolve_names) -> printing namespace structure or comparing ASTs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static AST parsing and manipulation for testing import and namespace handling. It does not perform any network, file, or system modifications. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The external modules used are assumed safe based on context. The logic is straightforward and focused on code structure validation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, well-structured test suite for AST-based import and namespace analysis. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The scores should be malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
