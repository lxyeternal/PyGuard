  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging the python_minifier project, defining metadata, package data, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, static import statements, package configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and follows typical packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script that reads a README file and configures package metadata, data files, classifiers, and entry points. It does not perform any dynamic code execution, network activity, or handle untrusted input. No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code's static, well-structured nature confirms its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action is necessary.",
