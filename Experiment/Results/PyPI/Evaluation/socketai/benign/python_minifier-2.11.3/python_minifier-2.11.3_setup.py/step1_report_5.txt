  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for the 'python_minifier' package, used to distribute and install the package.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup parameters are static or derived from file read.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setup() configuration -> package installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads a markdown file for long description and configures package metadata and entry points. Uses standard setuptools functions. No dynamic or malicious code execution, no network activity, no handling of untrusted inputs. The code structure and imports are typical for a setup script. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no indications of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this code. It only performs package configuration and file reading.",
