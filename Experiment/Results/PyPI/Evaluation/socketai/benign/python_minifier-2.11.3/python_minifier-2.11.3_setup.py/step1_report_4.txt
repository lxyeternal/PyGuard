{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'python_minifier', used to package and distribute the source code and related data.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; importing setup and find_packages from setuptools; reading package metadata from code variables.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly sends untrusted data, executes system commands, or processes external input in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "The script reads a local README file to populate long description metadata; it uses predefined package data and configuration without dynamic or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. All code appears to be standard package setup procedures without hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up package metadata and configuration using static code and data read from a file. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or sensitive data handling is present. The only file I/O is reading a README file, which is typical. The setup parameters and data do not contain any suspicious or malicious content. The code adheres to standard Python packaging practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python module. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It performs typical package configuration tasks without handling untrusted data or executing arbitrary code.",
