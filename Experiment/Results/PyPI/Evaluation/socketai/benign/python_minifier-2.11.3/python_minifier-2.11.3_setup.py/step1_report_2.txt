{
  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distributing the 'python_minifier' Python project.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, importing modules, and package discovery via find_packages.",
  "sinks": "None present; no handling of untrusted data or sensitive information occurs in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup script does not process external input dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code adheres to standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, reads a local README.md file for long description, and uses setuptools to define package metadata and configuration. It specifies package locations, data files, Python version requirements, and entry points. All operations are standard for Python package setup, with no code execution, data handling, or dynamic input processing that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical setup tasks without any suspicious behavior.",
