  "purpose": "Setup script for the python_minifier package, defining package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md file for long description; reads package source code via find_packages.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no runtime data handling or external communication within this script.",
  "flows": "N/A, primarily static configuration and file reading with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py for a Python package. It reads the README file to include a long description, specifies package details, dependencies, classifiers, and entry points for CLI. No user input handling, no network activity, no code execution beyond static imports and file reads. The code appears to follow standard package setup conventions without suspicious modifications or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely defines package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
