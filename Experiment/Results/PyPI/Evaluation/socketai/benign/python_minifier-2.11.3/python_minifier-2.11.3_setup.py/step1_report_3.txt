{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package named 'python_minifier', used to package and distribute the minifier tool.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description; uses setuptools to gather package information and data files.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks involved; no untrusted data handling or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "Reads the README.md file at the start; flows are limited to package metadata and file reading for setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. The code appears to be standard package setup code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules for file handling and package setup. It constructs the path to README.md and reads its content, which is typical for setup scripts. The setup() function configures package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and entry points. All code follows standard practices for Python package distribution. No suspicious or malicious code, such as network access, code execution, or credential handling, is present. The code solely defines package configuration and installation parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions to prepare the package for distribution without any embedded malicious code.",
