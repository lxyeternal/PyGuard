{
  "purpose": "The code defines test functions to verify the behavior of the python_minifier library on static code snippets involving nonlocal and import statements, executing original and minified code to ensure correctness.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded string snippets within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "The exec() function executes the code snippets, which could be a potential sink if input were untrusted, but here it is controlled.",
  "flows": "Source (hardcoded code snippets) flows into exec(), which executes the code; the minify function processes the code before execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward and contains no obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static test snippets executed via exec() before and after minification, with assertions verifying behavior. No external input or untrusted data is involved. The code does not contain malicious payloads, obfuscation, or backdoors. The use of exec() is standard in testing environments but should be avoided with untrusted input. Overall, the code is benign, and the risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a controlled test suite for the python_minifier library, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The use of exec() on static code snippets poses negligible risk in this context. Scores are consistent with this assessment.",
