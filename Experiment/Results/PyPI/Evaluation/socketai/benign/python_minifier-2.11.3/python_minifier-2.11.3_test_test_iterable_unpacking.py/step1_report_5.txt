{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a test suite for Python code minification, using the python_minifier library to compare original and minified ASTs.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries (ast, sys) and testing framework (pytest), and functions from python_minifier",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute code dynamically",
  "flows": "Input source code is parsed into an AST, then minified and compared to the original AST",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code uses standard practices for testing AST manipulation, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and defines a test function that skips based on Python version, then constructs source code strings, parses them into ASTs, minifies the code, and compares ASTs. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The use of ast and pytest is typical for testing code transformations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite for verifying the correctness of Python code minification. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
