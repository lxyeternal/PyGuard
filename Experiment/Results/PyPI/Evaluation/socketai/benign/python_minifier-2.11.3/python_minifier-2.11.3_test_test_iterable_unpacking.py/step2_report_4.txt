  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a straightforward test script for a Python minifier, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it accurately describes the code as a benign test suite with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, the analysis aligns with the code being a standard test for code minification, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; the code is a benign test script.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; a typical test for AST manipulation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify the code as a benign test script for a Python minifier.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** None detected; the code performs static analysis and testing only.\n- **Scores consistency:** All assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are reasonable and justified.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely for testing the correctness of a minification tool, with no external data handling, code execution, or malicious payloads.\n- The logic and flow are straightforward, and the code relies solely on standard and third-party libraries designed for testing.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here; the code is safe and well-understood.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the code's benign nature.
