{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a test script for the python_minifier package, specifically testing the unparse functionality and AST comparison for Python version compatibility.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (ast, sys), and third-party libraries (pytest, python_minifier). No external input reading or data input points are present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output, network activity, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The code only manipulates static source code strings and AST objects internally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code performs standard testing and version-based conditionals without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for AST manipulation and testing, then defines a test function that conditionally constructs source code strings based on Python version. It parses the code into ASTs, minifies the code, and compares the original and minified ASTs. All operations are related to code transformation validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, external data handling, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test script for a Python minification tool, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It solely performs static code analysis and testing functions.",
