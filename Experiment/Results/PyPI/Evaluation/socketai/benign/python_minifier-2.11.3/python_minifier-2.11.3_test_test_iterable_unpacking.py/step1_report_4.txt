{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for a Python minifier, verifying that it correctly handles return statements with unpacking across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (ast, sys), third-party libraries (pytest, python_minifier). The source code strings are defined within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not send untrusted data to any external system, nor does it execute or evaluate code from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "The code reads Python source code strings, parses them into ASTs, un-parses them back to code, and compares the ASTs to ensure correctness.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected. The test logic is straightforward and self-contained.",
  "analysis": "The script performs version checks and constructs Python source code strings accordingly, then parses and compares ASTs to validate minification. It relies solely on standard and third-party libraries designed for testing and code parsing. There are no indications of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be a standard test suite for a code minifier, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test script for a Python code minifier. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The use of standard libraries and straightforward logic supports this conclusion.",
