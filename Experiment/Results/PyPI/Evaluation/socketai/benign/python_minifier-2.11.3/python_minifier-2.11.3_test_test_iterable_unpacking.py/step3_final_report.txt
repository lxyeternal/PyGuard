  "purpose": "Test script for validating the correctness of the python_minifier's unparse function across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded source code strings within the test functions, used for parsing and minification.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or outputs; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Static source code strings are parsed into ASTs, minified, and compared; no dynamic data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign test suite that verifies code minification consistency across Python versions. It uses standard libraries and third-party testing tools, with no external data, network activity, or code execution from untrusted sources. The purpose is purely static analysis and AST comparison, with no malicious or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, security risk score of 0, and obfuscation score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
