{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration options and logging classes for managing HTTP/2 connection behavior in a network stack.",
  "sources": "Input sources include constructor parameters and property setters such as 'header_encoding' and boolean configuration options.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the 'logger' attribute which can output logs, but it defaults to a dummy logger. No direct data leakage or malicious sink evident.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters flow from constructor and property setters into the internal attributes; logger methods can output information but are non-intrusive.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or behavior detected. The logger classes are simple, and configuration options are standard. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes configuration management for an HTTP/2 stack with validation to prevent incorrect types, particularly for boolean options and header encoding. Logging classes are straightforward, with dummy and output variants, and no code execution based on untrusted data. The header_encoding setter enforces constraints, but does not perform any unsafe operations. Overall, the code is clean, well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard configuration module for HTTP/2 connections with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It primarily handles configuration validation and logging without external data leaks or malicious code. The overall security risk is minimal.",
