  "purpose": "Configuration management and logging utilities for HTTP/2 stack, providing options for feature toggles and logging behaviors.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters, class attribute accessors, validation functions, and logging method calls.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; validation enforces correct types, and logging outputs are standard.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and attribute setters flow into internal state; validation prevents invalid values; logging methods output to stderr or file.",
  "anomalies": "The header_encoding setter explicitly disallows setting to True, which is a validation constraint, not malicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration options with type validation, simple logging classes (DummyLogger and OutputLogger), and a configuration class (H2Configuration) with parameters controlling header encoding, header validation, normalization, and logging. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. Validation logic is standard, and logging is straightforward. The code is clear, well-structured, and intended for configuration purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration and logging utility for an HTTP/2 stack. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal operational risk rather than security threat.",
