  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; no issues found.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None detected. The code is straightforward configuration management and logging.\n- **Scores:** Malware score = 0, risk score = 0.2 seems reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, just configuration validation and simple logging.\n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; no issues detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware score = 0, risk score = 0.1 appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Standard configuration management, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; no issues detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware score = 0, risk score = 0.1 appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Purely configuration and validation logic.\n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; no issues detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware score = 0, risk score = 0.0 appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Simple configuration and logging, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code matches the description; no issues detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware score = 0, risk score = 0.1 appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Standard validation and logging, no malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** All are low (0.0 to 0.2), aligning with the code's functionality.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (average low risk for configuration code)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured configuration and logging utility for an HTTP/2 stack. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and should remain as-is.",
