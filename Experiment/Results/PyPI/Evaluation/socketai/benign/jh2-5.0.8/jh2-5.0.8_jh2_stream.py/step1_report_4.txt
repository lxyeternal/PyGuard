{
  "purpose": "Implementation of an HTTP/2 stream handling, including state management, frame processing, and header encoding/decoding.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules, processing of headers, frames, and stream events; functions for header normalization and validation; class methods processing frame input, headers, data, window updates, and stream resets.",
  "sinks": "Processing headers and frames that may originate from untrusted peers; handling incoming data and headers; methods that process incoming frames and headers; functions that encode headers for transmission.",
  "flows": "Incoming headers/data → process_input() → state transition functions → event generation; outgoing frames (headers, data, push promises, resets) based on state and input; header encoding/decoding flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activities; header validation and normalization are standard; no obfuscation or hidden code; error handling consistent; no dynamic code execution found.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a state machine for HTTP/2 stream management, including various frame types and stream states. It carefully processes headers, data, push promises, and window updates, ensuring proper flow control and validation. Header encoding/decoding uses external libraries with fallbacks, and no malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network connections, or system modification are present. The import statements are limited to local modules, and there are no indications of hidden or malicious code. The handling of errors and exceptions aligns with standard protocol processing. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate, protocol-compliant implementation with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard HTTP/2 stream implementation focusing on state management, frame handling, and header processing. It contains no suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code is well-structured, adheres to protocol specifications, and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious activity.",
