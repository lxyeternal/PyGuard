  "purpose": "Implementation of an HTTP/2 stream, handling frame processing, state management, and flow control.",
  "sources": "Imports modules for errors, events, exceptions, frame types, utilities, and a possibly optional Encoder from a hazmat module.",
  "sinks": "Frame sending methods (e.g., send_headers, push_stream_in_band, send_data, reset_stream, acknowledge_received_data), processing received frames (e.g., receive_headers, receive_data, receive_window_update, receive_alt_svc).",
  "flows": "Input to state machine via process_input() in various methods; data received or sent flows through frame creation, headers processing, and flow control management; events generated and passed along.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious strings; no obfuscated code; use of dynamic attribute assignment is minimal; optional import of Encoder appears benign. No unusual or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a comprehensive implementation of an HTTP/2 stream, managing states, frames, headers, flow control, and error handling. The state machine logic strictly follows RFC 7540. It performs standard operations without any hidden or suspicious behaviors. No network connections, data exfiltration, or system harm code are present. The optional import of Encoder from _hazmat is standard for cryptographic or compression purposes, not malicious. There are no hardcoded secrets or control-flow anomalies. Overall, the code is a typical, detailed implementation of HTTP/2 stream logic with no evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, standard implementation of an HTTP/2 stream, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles protocol state, frame processing, and flow control securely and correctly. No security risks are evident within this module.",
