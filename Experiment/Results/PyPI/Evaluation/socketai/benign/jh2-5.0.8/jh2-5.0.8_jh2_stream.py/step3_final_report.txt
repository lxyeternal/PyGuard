{
  "purpose": "Implementation of an HTTP/2 stream with frame handling, state management, and header processing, adhering to RFC 7540 standards.",
  "sources": "Header decoding functions, frame processing routines, state transition inputs, optional cryptographic module import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks indicating malicious activity; standard header and frame processing.",
  "flows": "Headers received or sent flow through header validation and decoding functions; frame processing flows through state machine transitions based on input events.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; header decoding and optional import are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a comprehensive HTTP/2 stream state machine, handling frame processing, header validation, flow control, and error management. It follows RFC 7540 protocols without obfuscation or malicious patterns. The optional import of '_hazmat.Encoder' is benign, used for header compression. No network leaks, backdoors, or covert channels are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's functionality and security posture.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, RFC 7540-compliant HTTP/2 stream implementation with no malicious or obfuscated elements. It maintains low security risk and is safe for use.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
