  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential vulnerabilities, and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** The reviewer concludes that the code is a standard, protocol-compliant implementation of an HTTP/2 stream, with no malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, and confidence is high (0.9).\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code implements a state machine, header processing, frame handling, and error management aligned with RFC 7540. No suspicious logic, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:** The only minor point is the `_decode_headers` function, which decodes headers without explicit sanitization, but this is typical in header decoding routines and not malicious.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate; the overall security risk is low (~0.2), aligning with the report.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the reviewer finds the implementation standard, with no signs of malicious activity. Malware score is 0, confidence high (0.9).\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code manages frame processing, state transitions, header validation, and flow control correctly, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:** The optional import of `Encoder` from `_hazmat` is standard for compression or cryptography, not malicious.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware score 0 is justified; no malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** Again, the reviewer sees a proper, RFC 7540-compliant implementation, with no malicious activity. Malware score 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code handles untrusted data carefully, with header validation and state management, no obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:** No hidden network activity or backdoors; the code's focus is strictly on protocol compliance.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** The implementation appears standard, with no signs of malicious behavior. Malware score 0, confidence 0.95.\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code manages frame processing, headers, flow control, and errors per RFC 7540, with no suspicious logic.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:** No obfuscation or malicious code; the use of external modules is standard.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware score 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment Summary:** The reviewer concludes the code is a typical, secure implementation with no malicious activity. Malware score 0, confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code's structure, header processing, state management, and frame handling are consistent with RFC 7540, with no suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Potential Concerns:** The optional import of `_hazmat.Encoder` is standard and not malicious.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code contains no evidence of malicious behavior—no network leaks, backdoors, obfuscated code, or hidden commands.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports rate 0, which is consistent. The code is clear, structured, and adheres to standards.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but generally low (~0.1-0.2), which is reasonable given the protocol compliance and lack of suspicious activity.\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no malicious intent or activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — minor potential concerns are mitigated by protocol adherence and code clarity.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a well-structured, RFC 7540-compliant HTTP/2 stream implementation. It handles frame processing, header validation, and state transitions securely, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \nNo adjustments needed; the current scores accurately reflect the code's security posture.",
