{
  "purpose": "The code implements an HTTP/2 stream handling mechanism, including state management, frame processing, and header handling for an HTTP/2 connection.",
  "sources": "Inputs come from received frames (headers, data, window updates, push promises, etc.), headers and frame data are read from network streams, and internal state changes are triggered by method calls and frame receptions.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data, such as headers and frame payloads, can influence state transitions, trigger events, or modify flow control windows. Frame data can potentially be used to cause buffer overflows or injection if not properly validated, but header validation functions are invoked.",
  "flows": "Headers or data received (sources) are processed by state machine methods which may trigger events and modify internal state, including flow control windows. Sending headers, push promises, or data frames is governed by state checks and frame construction functions, with header encoding and validation ensuring integrity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present. The code performs header validation, state transitions, and frame management in line with RFC 7540. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution is evident. Exception handling and state management are straightforward and follow RFC specifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is a low-level HTTP/2 stream implementation focusing on frame processing and state management. It strictly follows RFC 7540 with appropriate validation and state transitions. No suspicious network connections, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors are detected. Header encoding, window management, and error handling are implemented securely. The only potential concern is the handling of headers and frame data, but validation functions are used. Overall, it appears to be a standard, security-conscious implementation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an HTTP/2 stream state machine with proper validation, error handling, and adherence to RFC 7540. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or sabotage are identified. The likelihood of malicious intent is very low.",
