  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements an HTTP/2 stream with frame handling, state management, and header processing. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The report emphasizes compliance with RFC 7540 and standard practices.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (low)\n\n- **Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code is a standard, protocol-compliant implementation with no signs of malicious behavior. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirming standard implementation with no malicious activity. Notes the optional import of an Encoder from a _hazmat module, which is typical for cryptographic or compression purposes.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (very low)\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. The optional import is benign, and the code's logic is standard. The risk score aligns well.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on input sources and potential influence of untrusted data on state transitions. Concludes that the code follows RFC 7540 and contains no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough. No signs of malicious activity, and the low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Emphasizes header processing, frame handling, and strict RFC 7540 adherence. Finds no suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is solid. The code appears to be a legitimate implementation with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the management of stream states, frames, and flow control, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the code is standard and secure.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Presence of Malicious Behavior:** None detected. The code is a standard, RFC 7540-compliant HTTP/2 stream implementation.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or hidden logic.\n\n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** The header encoding/decoding functions are standard; no suspicious network activity or backdoors are present.\n\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports assign very low malware and obfuscated scores, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Risk Scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2) reflects minimal inherent protocol handling risks, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated Scores for the entire code:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, well-structured code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Slight inherent risk due to protocol complexity, but no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate, protocol-compliant HTTP/2 stream implementation with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The low scores across malware, obfuscation, and risk are justified.",
