  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Implements standard HTTP/2 connection handling, frame processing, stream management, header decoding, flow control, etc.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of malicious behavior. Use of base64 during upgrade is standard, not suspicious. Error handling and decoding follow protocol.\n- **Analysis:** Fully protocol-compliant, no backdoors, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk, legitimate implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low)\n\n**Report 2 & 3:**\n- **Errors:** Empty responses, no data to analyze.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to report 1, implementing standard HTTP/2 connection, frame handling, flow control, etc.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious signs. Use of base64 in upgrade is standard. No suspicious code or backdoors. Logging is for debugging only.\n- **Analysis:** Protocol-compliant, no malicious activity, no backdoors, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard implementation, no malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (still low, but slightly higher due to the complexity of the implementation)\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Checking Scores:\n- Both reports 1 and 4 give malware scores of 0, obfuscated 0, and low risk scores (~0.1-0.2). This aligns with their analysis.\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present.\n- The use of base64 in the upgrade process is a protocol standard, not malicious.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or hiding techniques observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1-0.2 (very low, standard protocol implementation)\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is a standard, compliant HTTP/2 implementation.\n- No suspicious behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious network activity.\n- The use of base64 during upgrade is a common practice, not malicious.\n- Error handling and frame processing are aligned with protocol specifications.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, inherent to complex protocol code but no evident vulnerabilities)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, protocol-compliant HTTP/2 connection handler with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments needed.",
