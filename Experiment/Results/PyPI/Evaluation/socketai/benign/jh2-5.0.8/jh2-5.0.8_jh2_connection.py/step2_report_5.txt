  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Report 1**:\n   - **Purpose & Sources**: Implements standard HTTP/2 connection handling, frame processing, stream management.\n   - **Sinks & Flows**: Outgoing frames are serialized and stored for network transmission; incoming data flows from network buffers into frame and header decoders.\n   - **Anomalies**: No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The use of base64 during upgrade is standard practice in HTTP/2 handshakes, not malicious.\n   - **Analysis & Conclusion**: The implementation appears protocol-compliant, robust, and free of malicious activity. The security risk is low.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - **Malware**: 0 (correct)\n     - **Obfuscated**: 0 (correct)\n     - **Risk**: 0.1 (appropriate for a standard protocol implementation)\n\n2. **Reports 2, 3, 5**:\n   - **Issue**: \"Empty response\" with no further information.\n   - **Assessment**: No data provided to evaluate, no signs of malicious code or anomalies.\n\n3. **Report 4**:\n   - **Purpose & Sources**: Similar to report 1, implementing HTTP/2 connection with frame and flow control management.\n   - **Anomalies**: No signs of malicious activity. Use of base64 in upgrade process is standard. No obfuscation or backdoors detected.\n   - **Analysis & Conclusion**: Again, a standard, protocol-compliant implementation with no malicious behavior.\n   - **Scores**:\n     - **Malware**: 0 (correct)\n     - **Obfuscated**: 0 (correct)\n     - **Risk**: 0.2 (justified for a well-implemented protocol handler)\n\n**Summary & Justification**:\n- The code snippets and reports indicate a legitimate, standards-compliant HTTP/2 protocol implementation.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or backdoors are present.\n- The use of base64 during upgrade is a protocol requirement, not malicious.\n- Error handling and frame processing follow RFC specifications.\n- The security risk is minimal, given the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n**Final Estimations**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (no obfuscation or hiding techniques)\n- **Risk score**: 0.2 (low, due to the complexity of protocol handling but no malicious intent)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe supply chain security risk for this open-source dependency appears very low. The code is a standard, compliant HTTP/2 connection handler with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary.",
