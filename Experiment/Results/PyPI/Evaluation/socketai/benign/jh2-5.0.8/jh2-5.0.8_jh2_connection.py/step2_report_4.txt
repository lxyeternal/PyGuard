  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Implements standard HTTP/2 connection handling, frame processing, stream management, and flow control.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or malicious behavior; uses base64 in upgrade handshake as per protocol, not malicious.\n- **Analysis:** Fully compliant with RFCs, no signs of backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, low risk, no malware.\n\n**Report 2 & 3 & 5:**\n- **Errors:** Empty responses, no data to analyze.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to report 1, implements standard HTTP/2 protocol with frame handling, stream management, and flow control.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious behavior; use of base64 during upgrade is standard, not suspicious.\n- **Analysis:** Protocol-compliant, no signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe, no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review & Score Justification:\n\n- **Malware Score:**  \n  All reports indicate standard protocol implementation without any malicious payloads, obfuscated code, or suspicious network behavior. The use of base64 during upgrade is a normal protocol procedure, not malicious.  \n  **Current malware scores: 0** are justified.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:**  \n  No obfuscation detected. The code is clear, standard, and readable.  \n  **Current obfuscated scores: 0** are justified.\n\n- **Risk Score:**  \n  Given the detailed analysis, the implementation appears secure and compliant. The low risk scores (0.1 and 0.2) are appropriate, reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The code is a well-structured, RFC-compliant HTTP/2 implementation.\n- No backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 – 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign my own estimates after this review, I would keep the scores as they are, possibly lowering the risk to 0, given the lack of any suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Confirmed issues:** None.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** Reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- **Overall security posture:** Very low risk, no malware, no obfuscation.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious intent. No further action needed based on these reports.",
