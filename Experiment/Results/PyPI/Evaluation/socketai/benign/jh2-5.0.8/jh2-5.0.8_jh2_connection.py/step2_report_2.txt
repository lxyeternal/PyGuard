  "review": "Let's analyze each report step-by-step:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Describes standard HTTP/2 connection handling, frame processing, header decoding, flow control, and stream management.\n- **Anomalies:** Mentions use of base64 in upgrade handshake, which is standard for HTTP/2 upgrade procedures, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears protocol-compliant, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low). This seems reasonable given the detailed analysis.\n\n**Report 2 & 3:**\n- **Error:** Empty responses, no data to analyze. No issues here.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to report 1, describes standard HTTP/2 handling, frame processing, flow control, and stream management.\n- **Anomalies:** Again, notes use of base64 in upgrade, which is standard, not suspicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The implementation appears compliant with RFCs, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Given the thorough description and no suspicious elements, this seems appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Error:** Empty response, no data.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review of scores and reasoning:\n\n- The **malware score** is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis: no malicious code, network exfiltration, command injection, or backdoors are evident.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, consistent with the code being straightforward, protocol-compliant, and not minified or deliberately obscured.\n- The **security risk score** is low (0.1–0.2), which is reasonable given the detailed review confirms no malicious intent or vulnerabilities beyond standard protocol handling.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- The use of base64 during upgrade is a standard protocol operation, not malicious.\n- Exception handling is robust, and no suspicious dynamic code execution or hidden payloads are present.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, standard protocol implementation risk)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, compliant HTTP/2 implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- I agree with the provided scores.\n- No changes necessary.\n- The code appears secure and legitimate.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain current scores. The supply chain security risk for this dependency is very low.",
