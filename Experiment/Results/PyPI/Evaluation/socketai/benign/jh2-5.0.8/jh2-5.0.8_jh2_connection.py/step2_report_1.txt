  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and step-by-step:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** The description confirms standard HTTP/2 connection handling, frame processing, stream management, header decoding, flow control, and upgrade procedures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The report notes the use of base64 encoding during the upgrade handshake, which is a standard part of the HTTP/2 upgrade process, not suspicious. No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated behavior is found.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, protocol-compliant HTTP/2 implementation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 seem reasonable given the detailed analysis.\n\n**Report 2 & 3:**\n- **Error:** \"Empty response\" — no actual content to analyze. No issues or malicious indicators can be inferred.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to report 1, it describes a standard HTTP/2 connection implementation with frame handling, stream management, flow control, and upgrade procedures.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Again, the use of base64 in the upgrade process is standard. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** The implementation appears legitimate, protocol-compliant, and free of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 are consistent with the detailed reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Review and Justification:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is a standard HTTP/2 protocol handler, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports:** The reports are consistent, primarily stating the absence of malicious behavior, with no false assumptions or logical flaws.\n- **Scores justification:**\n  - **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is justified; no malicious activity detected.\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation or code hiding techniques are observed.\n  - **Risk score:** Very low, as the code is a standard implementation with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The only minor concern is the use of base64 during upgrade, but this is a standard protocol procedure, not a vulnerability or covert channel.\n- **Consistency of scores:** The scores align with the reports' conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores for the entire code:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation or hiding techniques)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (standard protocol implementation, minimal security risk)\n\n**Overall:** The code is a legitimate, standard HTTP/2 implementation with no signs of malicious activity or backdoors. The low risk score reflects the protocol compliance and absence of suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate.  \n- No modifications needed; the scores are appropriate.  \n- The code is safe and well-implemented from a security perspective.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain the current low malware and obfuscated scores.  \n- Keep the risk score minimal, around 0.1–0.2.",
