  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code snippet is minimal, containing only a docstring, a version string, and an import statement.\n   - There are no functions, classes, input/output operations, or network interactions.\n   - Based on the provided code, there are no observable issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment that this is just a placeholder or header for a larger module.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The conclusion that this code is benign and contains no security risks aligns with the actual content.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero or near-zero, which is appropriate given the code's minimal and benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty in the benign assessment.\n   - The securityRisk scores are very low (mostly 0.1), which is reasonable given the absence of any suspicious activity.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - None of the reports justify higher risk scores; all appropriately assign low or zero scores.\n   - Since there's no code behavior or data flow, raising the risk score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Considerations:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid speculative claims; they correctly interpret the snippet as a placeholder or module header.\n   - No assumptions about hidden behaviors are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's content.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk evident.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nGiven the code's minimal nature and lack of executable or sensitive content, the overall risk remains negligible. All reports are accurate in their benign assessment. No adjustments to scores are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code snippet is a placeholder or header for an HTTP/2 implementation module.\n- It contains no executable logic, no data handling, and no security concerns.\n- The current scoring accurately reflects this.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
