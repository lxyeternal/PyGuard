  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content & Logic Presence**:\n   - All reports agree that the code snippet is minimal, containing only a docstring, a version string, and an import statement.\n   - No functions, classes, data handling, network operations, or executable logic are present.\n   - Given this, there are no observable data flows, sinks, or sources that could be exploited or cause security issues.\n\n2. **Potential for Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The reports consistently state there's no malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The only unusual aspect noted is that the code appears to be a placeholder or header for a larger module, which is benign.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Malware Scores**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, aligning with the absence of malicious code.\n   - Security risk scores are very low (mostly 0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the minimal and benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Assessment of the Reports' Reasoning & Scores**:\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1.0), reflecting strong agreement on the benign nature.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n   - The security risk scores are appropriately low, considering the code's simplicity.\n\n5. **Any Discrepancies or Concerns?**\n   - No discrepancies are evident. The reports are consistent and justified.\n   - Since the code is purely a placeholder with no executable or data-sensitive components, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n\n**Final Evaluation & Recommendations**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: Should remain at 0, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: Remain at 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score**: Given the code's trivial nature, a risk score of 0.1 seems reasonable; it reflects minimal concern but acknowledges that this is a placeholder snippet.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a benign, minimal header or placeholder for an HTTP/2 implementation module.\n- No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The scores provided in the reports are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nBased on this analysis, I agree with the reports' assessments. The code snippet poses no security threat, and the scoring is consistent with its content.",
