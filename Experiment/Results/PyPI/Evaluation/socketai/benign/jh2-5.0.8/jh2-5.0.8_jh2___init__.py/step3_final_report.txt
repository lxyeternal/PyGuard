  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal header or placeholder for an HTTP/2 implementation module, providing version information and a docstring description.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings (__version__, docstring) and an import statement for __future__.annotations.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data flows present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks exist; the code contains only static declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code are present; the code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module header with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. All reports correctly identify its benign, placeholder nature. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate given the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module header with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
