  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed as the code does not process any data.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; the only unusual aspect is the presence of an incomplete or placeholder comment and a version string. No malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of a docstring describing an HTTP/2 implementation, an import statement from __future__, and a version string variable. There are no functions, classes, input handling, or network operations. The content appears to be a minimal header or placeholder for a larger module. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a basic header or placeholder with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It contains no suspicious behavior, and its structure is straightforward and benign.",
