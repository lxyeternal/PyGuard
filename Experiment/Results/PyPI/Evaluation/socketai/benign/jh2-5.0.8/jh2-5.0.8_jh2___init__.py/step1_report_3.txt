{
  "purpose": "A HTTP/2 implementation module, likely providing functionality to handle HTTP/2 protocol.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are identifiable due to the minimal code provided.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of code beyond a docstring, version string, and an import statement; no suspicious or unusual code elements observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a module docstring describing its purpose, a version string, and an import statement for future annotations. There are no functions, classes, or executable code that could read inputs, process data, or produce outputs. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The minimal code indicates this is a stub or part of a larger package, but on its own, it shows no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless, minimal placeholder or header for a HTTP/2 implementation library. It contains no executable logic or suspicious elements. Based on this snippet alone, there is no indication of malicious activity or security risks.",
