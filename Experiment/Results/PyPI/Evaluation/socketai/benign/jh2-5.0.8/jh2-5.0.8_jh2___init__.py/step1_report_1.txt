  "flows": "No data flows are identifiable in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code present; only version declaration and a comment. No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment describing the module as an HTTP/2 implementation, a future import statement, and a version string. There are no functions, classes, input/output operations, or data handling routines. Since the provided snippet contains no logic, data processing, or external interactions, it cannot be assessed for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This minimal code snippet appears to be a documentation or metadata placeholder for an HTTP/2 implementation module. It contains no executable or security-sensitive code, and therefore poses no security risks or malware concerns.",
