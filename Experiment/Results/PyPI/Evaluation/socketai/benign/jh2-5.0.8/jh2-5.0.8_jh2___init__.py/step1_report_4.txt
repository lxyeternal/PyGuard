  "purpose": "A HTTP/2 implementation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are demonstrated in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code content; presence of a version string without functional code is typical. No suspicious code or hardcoded credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a docstring, a future import statement, and a version string. There are no functions, classes, data processing, input/output operations, or network interactions present. The code appears to be a minimal header or module description for a larger library. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or security risks are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a minimal module header with no functional or malicious content. It does not contain any security threats or malicious behavior. The absence of data handling, external calls, or sensitive information indicates a safe component.",
