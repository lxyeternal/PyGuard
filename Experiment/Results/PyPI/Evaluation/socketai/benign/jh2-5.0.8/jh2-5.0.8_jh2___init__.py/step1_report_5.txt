  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a docstring describing the module, an import statement for future annotations, and a version string. There are no functions, classes, or runtime behaviors that could be exploited. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or obfuscated code are present. The module appears to be a minimal placeholder or a part of a larger project without any malicious or suspicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code fragment contains no malicious behavior, no security risks, and appears to be a benign module description and version declaration. It is unlikely to pose any security threats.",
