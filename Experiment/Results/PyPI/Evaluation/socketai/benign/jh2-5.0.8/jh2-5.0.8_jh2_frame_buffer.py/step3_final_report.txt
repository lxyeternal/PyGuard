{
  "purpose": "A data structure that provides a way to iterate over a byte buffer in terms of frames, specifically for HTTP/2 protocol handling.",
  "sources": "Data added via add_data() method, reading frame headers in __next__(), and parsing frame bodies.",
  "sinks": "Frame parsing functions that process untrusted data, potentially leading to exceptions or malformed frame handling.",
  "flows": "Data flows from add_data() into internal buffer; frame headers are parsed in __next__, then frame bodies are validated and processed; header buffers are updated based on frame types.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of recursion in __next__() is standard for iterators and bounded by buffer size.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard HTTP/2 frame buffer with validation, error handling, and support for continuation frames. It performs length checks, validates frame headers, manages header blocks, and iterates over incoming data. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. Exception handling aligns with protocol standards. The recursive call in __next__() is controlled and typical for iterator implementations. The only configurable parameter, CONTINUATION_BACKLOG, is a security measure to prevent resource exhaustion. Overall, the code appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured HTTP/2 frame buffer implementation with no malicious or sabotage activity. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1-0.2). No adjustments are necessary.",
