  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, proper validation, no obfuscation, standard exception handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 (low, reflecting minimal security concern).\n- **Assessment:** The code appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The low risk score is appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1—standard buffer management, validation, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 (still low, slightly higher but still minimal).\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with a legitimate protocol handler; no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—standard implementation, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Valid and safe.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, standard validation, use of recursion in __next__ is typical for iterators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; the risk score remains low.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—standard, validated, no signs of sabotage.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with a safe, legitimate parser.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, which are very low and reflect standard protocol parsing concerns rather than security threats.\n\n### Final Step — My own estimates:\nGiven the detailed analysis:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity or payload detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, standard protocol handling risk, mainly related to malformed input or protocol violations, not malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured HTTP/2 frame buffer implementation with no signs of malicious or obfuscated activity. The low risk scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
