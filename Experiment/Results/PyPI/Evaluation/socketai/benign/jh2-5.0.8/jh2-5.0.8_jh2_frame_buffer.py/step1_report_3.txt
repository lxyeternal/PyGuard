  "purpose": "Implement a buffer for HTTP/2 frames, allowing iteration over frames in a byte stream, with validation and header management.",
  "sources": "Input data provided via add_data() method, which appends incoming byte streams; reading from the internal bytearray _data.",
  "sinks": "Parsing functions like parse_frame_header() and parse_body() process untrusted input data; potential for exceptions or malformed frame processing.",
  "flows": "add_data() adds data -> __next__() reads frame header and body -> _validate_frame_length() validates length -> parse_body() processes frame data -> _update_header_buffer() manages headers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic execution or obfuscated code; use of recursion in __next__() could be risky if not properly bounded, but in this context, it's controlled by buffer length. No external network or file operations observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a frame buffer for HTTP/2 protocol, with validation steps for frame length, header correctness, and continuation frames. It manages header frames and continuation frames, ensuring protocol compliance. No suspicious code, no data leaks, no external network activity, and no backdoors. The recursive call in __next__() is bounded by the buffer size, posing minimal risk. Overall, the code appears secure and well-structured with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical HTTP/2 frame buffer implementation with proper validation and header management. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It operates as expected for handling protocol frames securely.",
