{
  "purpose": "Implements a buffer for handling and parsing HTTP/2 frames, supporting iteration over frames in a byte stream.",
  "sources": "Data is read via the add_data method, which appends incoming bytes to the internal buffer.",
  "sinks": "Parsed frames are processed internally; potential issues could arise if untrusted data is malformed, but there are no explicit sinks like network transmissions or data exfiltration in this code.",
  "flows": "Input data -> add_data() method -> internal buffer -> __next__() parsing frames -> header buffer update -> return frames or continue iteration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The code uses a static preamble for HTTP/2 server mode. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code. No external network calls or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of an HTTP/2 frame buffer and parser. It performs frame validation, manages continuation frames, and raises exceptions on protocol violations. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network communication to suspicious domains. The use of exceptions for protocol errors is appropriate. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code handles untrusted data cautiously by validating frame lengths and types, and it raises errors on invalid data. Overall, the logic aligns with a typical safe parser, with no evident malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an HTTP/2 frame buffer and parser. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard validation and frame assembly tasks typical for protocol handling. The code is well-structured, and no suspicious anomalies are detected.",
