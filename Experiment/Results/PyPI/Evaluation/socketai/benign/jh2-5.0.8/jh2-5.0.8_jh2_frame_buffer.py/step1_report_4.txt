{
  "purpose": "Implements a buffer for HTTP/2 frames, allowing incremental addition of data, validation, and iteration over frames for processing.",
  "sources": "Data is read via the add_data method, which accepts arbitrary byte strings provided externally.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly write to external sinks; however, parsed frames could be used downstream in ways that might process untrusted data, but no direct data exfiltration or external system interaction is evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into add_data, appending to internal buffer; data is parsed in __next__, with frame headers extracted and validated; frames are assembled and validated before being yielded or discarded.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs standard buffer parsing and frame validation; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. Use of recursion in __next__ is a common pattern in iterator implementations and not malicious. No dynamic code execution or network operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a FrameBuffer class designed for processing HTTP/2 frames. It validates the preamble if server mode, appends incoming data, checks frame lengths, and manages header continuation frames using a buffer. Frame parsing relies on external classes (Frame, ContinuationFrame, etc.), with validation for frame size and continuity. No signs of malicious payload insertion, data exfiltration, or sabotage are detected. The logic appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of a frame parser with proper error handling. The only potential concern could be recursive calls in __next__, but this is a typical pattern for iterators and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an HTTP/2 frame buffer and parser. It performs expected validation and buffer management without any suspicious or malicious behavior. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or sabotage within this code fragment.",
