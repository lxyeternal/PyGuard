{
  "purpose": "The code provides a data structure to buffer and parse HTTP/2 frames, supporting iteration over frames with validation and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input data via add_data() method; parses frame headers and bodies during iteration; accesses class attributes for validation.",
  "sinks": "Raises exceptions if invalid preamble or frames are detected; no apparent data leakage or untrusted data sink beyond error raising.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into add_data() -> stored in _data -> frame headers parsed in __next__ -> frame bodies parsed -> frames possibly aggregated in _headers_buffer -> frames yielded from __next__.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. It performs standard protocol validation and frame handling. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code manages a byte buffer for HTTP/2 frames, validating preamble, frame size, and frame structure. It maintains a header buffer for continuation frames, ensuring correct sequence and protocol compliance. Error handling raises exceptions for invalid data or protocol violations. There is no evidence of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or system damage routines. The logic appears consistent with a standard frame parser, with no hidden behaviors or backdoors. The use of exceptions and strict validation indicates a focus on robustness rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate, protocol-compliant HTTP/2 frame buffer and parser. It performs standard validation, frame assembly, and error handling without any malicious or suspicious behaviors. No malware or security risks are detected based on this implementation.",
