{
  "purpose": "The code manages HTTP/2 flow control windows, tracking window sizes, processing bytes, and determining when to emit window update frames to avoid flow control blocking.",
  "sources": "Input data includes method parameters like 'size' in window_consumed, window_opened, process_bytes, and class attributes like max_window_size, current_window_size, and _bytes_processed.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include raising FlowControlError on invalid window states and updating internal window size variables, which influence network flow control but do not directly leak data or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "Input 'size' parameters flow into methods where they alter window sizes, with _bytes_processed accumulating and '_maybe_update_window' deciding whether to emit window updates by returning increment values; errors are raised if window invariants are violated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. The code appears to implement standard flow control logic without obfuscated or misleading constructs. The class handles internal state securely without external inputs influencing critical operations maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The module implements a standard, well-documented flow control mechanism for HTTP/2, managing window sizes and updates based on processed bytes. It enforces window size constraints and raises errors on violations. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The logic follows expected patterns for flow control management, with no suspicious external data handling or code injection points.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of HTTP/2 flow control window management. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is detected. It appears to be part of a legitimate networking library, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
