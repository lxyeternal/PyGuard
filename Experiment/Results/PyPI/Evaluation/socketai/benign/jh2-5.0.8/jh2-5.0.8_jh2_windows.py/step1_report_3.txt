{
  "purpose": "The code manages HTTP/2 flow control windows, tracking data consumption and managing window updates to prevent blocking or overflow.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the parameters in methods such as 'window_consumed', 'window_opened', and 'process_bytes', which receive sizes of data processed or received.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive operations are the modification of 'current_window_size' and raising of 'FlowControlError'. These are internal state updates, but they do not directly leak data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input methods where sizes are received (sources) to internal state updates (sinks). For example, 'window_consumed' reduces 'current_window_size'; 'process_bytes' updates '_bytes_processed' and possibly triggers window updates; '_maybe_update_window' calculates increments based on processed data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code segments are present. The code uses assertions, standard error handling, and straightforward algorithms. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic detected. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of HTTP/2 flow control management. It employs well-understood algorithms to prevent window overflow or underflow, raising errors if flow control is violated. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or malicious actions are present. The code appears clean, maintainable, and purpose-specific, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign, purposefully managing HTTP/2 flow control windows without any malicious behavior or security risks. No indicators of sabotage or malware are evident. It functions as intended within its scope, with no suspicious anomalies.",
