{
  "purpose": "Manage HTTP/2 flow control windows to prevent over- or under-utilization of flow control frames.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration input during class initialization; methods process bytes consumed and window updates.",
  "sinks": "Methods modify internal window size state; no direct output or network communication is performed within this code.",
  "flows": "Input data (bytes processed or window size changes) flows through methods that adjust internal state; no external data leaks or network effects are present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. Assert statements are used for validation, which is typical for ensuring correct state. The logic appears standard for flow control management.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a straightforward HTTP/2 window management logic, tracking bytes processed and adjusting window sizes accordingly. It enforces maximum window sizes and ensures that window updates are emitted based on processed data thresholds. No code injection, malicious network activity, or backdoors are evident. Usage of assertions, clear class and method structure, and lack of network operations or file I/O suggest this is standard flow control code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of HTTP/2 flow control window management without malicious intent. It does not contain malicious behaviors or security risks based on the provided content.",
