{
  "purpose": "The code provides a utility class for managing HTTP/2 flow control windows, tracking window sizes, consumed bytes, and determining when to send WINDOW_UPDATE frames.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from method parameters such as max_window_size, size in window_consumed, window_opened, process_bytes, and internal state variables. No external data sources or untrusted input reading is present.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the potential return value of _maybe_update_window, which indicates the number of bytes to increment in a WINDOW_UPDATE frame. No external system or network communication is directly triggered within this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (like size) modify internal state (current_window_size, _bytes_processed). The method process_bytes updates the processed bytes and calls _maybe_update_window, which may return an increment value for flow control. No external untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. Assertions are used for bounds checking, and error handling raises FlowControlError if window sizes are invalid, which is appropriate. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard HTTP/2 flow control window management algorithm, tracking processed bytes and window sizes. It includes bounds checks and raises errors on invalid states. The logic for updating the window size appears consistent with protocol behavior. No indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors, are found. The code is straightforward and self-contained, with no external dependencies beyond an exception class. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for HTTP/2 flow control window management. It performs expected calculations and state management without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or data leaks. Overall, it appears safe and aligned with standard protocol handling.",
