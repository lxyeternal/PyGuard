{
  "purpose": "Manages HTTP/2 flow control windows by tracking window size, data consumption, and emitting window updates to prevent blocking.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as 'size' in window_consumed, window_opened, process_bytes",
  "sinks": "Internal state variables: current_window_size, max_window_size, _bytes_processed",
  "flows": "Source methods update internal variables; process_bytes updates _bytes_processed; _maybe_update_window computes and returns increment, which updates current_window_size",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard HTTP/2 flow control logic with proper error handling and assertions. It does not perform network operations, data leaks, or execute untrusted code. The functions manipulate internal state in a predictable manner, and the algorithm prevents overflows and underflows. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of HTTP/2 flow control window management. It poses minimal security risk, with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
