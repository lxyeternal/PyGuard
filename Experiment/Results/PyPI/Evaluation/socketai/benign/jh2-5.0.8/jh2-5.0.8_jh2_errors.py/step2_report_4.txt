  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any discrepancies, inconsistencies, or overlooked issues, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a straightforward, static enumeration of HTTP/2 error codes with a simple helper function.\n- They uniformly state that there are no external inputs, outputs, or malicious behaviors.\n- The confidence level across reports is perfect (1.0), and all assign malware and security risk scores of 0.\n\n**Step-by-step review:**\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic:**\n   - The code defines an enum `ErrorCodes` with standard HTTP/2 error codes.\n   - The helper function `_error_code_from_int` attempts to convert an integer to an enum member, returning the integer if unknown.\n   - No external data, network operations, or data processing is present.\n   - The code is static, well-documented, and simple.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns:**\n   - No external inputs or outputs are processed.\n   - The function `_error_code_from_int` is a safe mapping utility, with no code injection or dynamic execution.\n   - No obfuscation, secrets, or backdoors are present.\n   - The code does not perform any I/O, network, or file operations.\n\n3. **Malware & Obfuscation:**\n   - No signs of malware, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n   - The code is clean, with clear comments and straightforward logic.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification:**\n   - All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and securityRisk = 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n5. **Any overlooked issues?**\n   - The only minor point is that the function `_error_code_from_int` returns either an enum or an integer, which might lead to inconsistent return types. However, this is a common pattern for such utility functions and not inherently insecure or malicious.\n   - No evidence of intentional vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, benign utility module defining constants and a safe mapping function.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nNo changes needed. The code is safe, and the reports correctly reflect that.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\nThe code is a simple, static enumeration with a safe utility function. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concerns. The scores and conclusions in the reports are appropriate and consistent.",
