  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to identify any inconsistencies, potential issues, or overestimations in the scoring.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code defines an enum for HTTP/2 error codes.\n- It includes a helper function to convert integers to enum members or return the integer if unknown.\n- The code is static, with no external input, output, or network interactions.\n- No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of Each Report:**\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** All correctly identify that the code is a static enumeration with a simple conversion function.\n- **Flows & Anomalies:** No suspicious data flows or anomalies are detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All conclude that the code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risk.\n- **Confidence & Scores:** All have a confidence of 1.0, malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0.\n\n**Consistency & Validity:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- They correctly identify that the code is a benign utility module for error code management.\n- No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present.\n\n---\n\n### **Critical Evaluation & Justification:**\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** The code is purely static, defining constants and a simple mapping function. There are no external inputs, no network calls, no data processing, or output operations that could be exploited.\n- **Malware & Security Risk:** Given the absence of dynamic code, external dependencies, or suspicious patterns, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear and straightforward; obfuscation is unwarranted, so 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Since there's no active vulnerability, no malicious intent, and the code is a standard enumeration, the overall security risk should be 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Adjustments:**\n\n- **Scores:** All reports currently assign a malware and security risk score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Should also be 0, as there's no indication of any security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (code is clear and well-structured)\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 (no vulnerabilities or risky behavior)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign, static utility for managing HTTP/2 error codes. No changes to the scoring are necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores at 0.\n- Confirm that the code is safe and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nThis is a straightforward, well-structured utility module with no malicious or obfuscated code. The current scoring accurately reflects its benign nature.",
