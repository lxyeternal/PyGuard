  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines an enumeration `ErrorCodes` for HTTP/2 error codes, with clear, well-documented constants.\n   - The helper function `_error_code_from_int` converts an integer to an enum member if it exists; otherwise, it returns the integer itself.\n   - There are no external inputs, network operations, or data processing involved.\n   - The code is static, straightforward, and primarily serves as a utility for error code management.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The code does not process untrusted data sources, perform network I/O, or execute dynamic code.\n   - The `_error_code_from_int` function is safe: it attempts to map an integer to an enum and handles unknown codes gracefully.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The comments and structure suggest it's a standard, maintainable utility module.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. There's no malicious code or behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and readable.\n   - **Security Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis; the code is benign.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws**:\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n   - No adjustments are necessary for the scores; they are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The logic in the report is sound; it correctly interprets the code as a simple, safe utility.\n\n5. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is purely static and self-contained, there is no hidden malicious behavior.\n   - The function `_error_code_from_int` is a common pattern for such mappings and does not introduce security concerns.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- The reports are accurate in their analysis.\n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified.\n- The code poses no security threat or malicious risk.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis code is a benign, well-structured utility module for managing HTTP/2 error codes, with no security concerns.",
