  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration of HTTP/2 error codes and provides a utility function to map integer codes to enum members or return the integer if unknown.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions and the _error_code_from_int function, which reads integer input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data, no output or external communication, and no handling of untrusted inputs beyond internal mapping.",
  "flows": "Input integer code flows into _error_code_from_int, which maps it to an enum or returns the integer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with clear enum definitions and simple error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an enumeration for known HTTP/2 error codes and a helper function to map integers to enum members or fallback to raw integers. There are no external inputs, data processing, or outputs that could be exploited. The function handles unknown codes gracefully by returning the integer, which is standard practice and not suspicious. No obfuscated or malicious constructs are present. Overall, this is a standard, benign utility module with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, well-structured enumeration with a safe helper function. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
