  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code defines an enumeration `ErrorCodes` for HTTP/2 error codes, aligning with RFC 7540 section 11.4.\n   - It includes a helper function `_error_code_from_int` that attempts to convert an integer to an `ErrorCodes` enum member, returning the integer if the code is unknown.\n   - The code is static, with no external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behavior.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior**:\n   - The code is purely declarative, defining constants and a simple mapping function.\n   - There are no external data sources, network operations, or data processing that could be exploited.\n   - The function `_error_code_from_int` is safe: it handles unknown codes gracefully by returning the integer, which is standard practice.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.\n\n3. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Risks**:\n   - Since the code only deals with static constants and a straightforward conversion, there are no evident vulnerabilities.\n   - The absence of external inputs means no injection or malicious data processing.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited, such as code execution, data leakage, or command injection.\n\n4. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0. All reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0. No obfuscation detected.\n   - **Risk score**: 0. Given the lack of vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or exploitable flaws, a zero risk score is appropriate.\n\n5. **Any discrepancies or overestimations?**\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature and provide thorough reasoning.\n   - The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk) are consistent with the code's content.\n\n6. **Additional considerations**:\n   - Since the code is simple and static, there is no need to adjust scores.\n   - The utility function is a common pattern and does not introduce security concerns.\n\n**Final assessment**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Security risk score**: 0\n\nThis code is a standard, well-structured enumeration with a safe helper function, posing no security threat or malicious behavior.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is benign.\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n- The reasoning in all reports aligns with the code's actual content and behavior.\n\n**Conclusion**: The overall security assessment remains that this code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
