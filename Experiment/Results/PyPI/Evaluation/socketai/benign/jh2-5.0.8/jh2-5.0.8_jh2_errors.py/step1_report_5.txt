{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for HTTP/2 error codes and provides a function to convert integers to these codes or return the integer if unknown.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data sources; the code contains only static definitions and a simple conversion function.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data processing that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "The function _error_code_from_int takes an integer input and attempts to convert it to an enum member; otherwise, returns the integer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a set of constants for HTTP/2 error codes using enum. It includes a helper function to map integer error codes to enum members or fallback to the integer if unknown. The implementation is clean, minimal, and contains no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. No potential security risks or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, static enumeration and a safe conversion function for HTTP/2 error codes. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities. It appears to be a benign, well-structured module.",
