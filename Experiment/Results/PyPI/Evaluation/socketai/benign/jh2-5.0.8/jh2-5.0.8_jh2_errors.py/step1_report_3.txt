  "purpose": "Define and manage HTTP/2 error codes using an enumeration, including a helper function to map integer codes to enum members.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from integer inputs to the function _error_code_from_int.",
  "sinks": "The function _error_code_from_int returns either an enum or an integer, but does not perform any dangerous actions with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input integer to _error_code_from_int -> attempts to map to ErrorCodes enum -> returns enum or integer.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and only defines constants and a simple conversion function.",
  "analysis": "The script defines an enumeration for known HTTP/2 error codes, including detailed comments. It provides a utility function to convert integers to enum members, defaulting to returning the integer if not found in the enum. No dynamic code execution, data leakage, external network access, or obfuscation is present. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless utility for error code management. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The structure and content are consistent with legitimate library code.",
