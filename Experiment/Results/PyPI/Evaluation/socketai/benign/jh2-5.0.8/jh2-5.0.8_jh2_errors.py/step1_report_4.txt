{
  "purpose": "Define and manage HTTP/2 error codes using an enumeration and a utility function for error code conversion.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs or data; it defines a class and a simple conversion function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or perform potentially dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "The function _error_code_from_int takes an integer and attempts to convert it to a known ErrorCodes enum, returning the integer if unknown.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enum for HTTP/2 error codes, providing human-readable names for standard codes. The function _error_code_from_int safely attempts to convert an integer to this enum, catching ValueError for unknown codes and returning the integer directly. There are no external inputs, outputs, or side effects. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation for handling HTTP/2 error codes. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
