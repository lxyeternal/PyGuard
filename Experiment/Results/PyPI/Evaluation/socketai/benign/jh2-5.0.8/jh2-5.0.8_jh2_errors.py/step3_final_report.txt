{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for HTTP/2 error codes and provides a helper function to convert integers to enum members, facilitating error code handling according to RFC 7540.",
  "sources": "Static enumeration members within the ErrorCodes class, no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Conversion function attempts to map integer input to enum; if unknown, returns the integer directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and static. The only minor point is the return of an integer for unknown codes, which is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, well-documented enumeration of HTTP/2 error codes with a simple utility function. It contains no external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The function gracefully handles unknown codes without risk. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The code's structure and purpose are clear and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module defining HTTP/2 error codes with a safe mapping function. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concerns. The current scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
