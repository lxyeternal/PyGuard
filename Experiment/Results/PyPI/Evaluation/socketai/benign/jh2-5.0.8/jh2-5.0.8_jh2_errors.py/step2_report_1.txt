  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Logic:**\n   - The code defines an enumeration (`ErrorCodes`) for HTTP/2 error codes, which are well-documented and match the RFC 7540 standard.\n   - The helper function `_error_code_from_int` attempts to convert an integer to an `ErrorCodes` enum member, returning the integer itself if the code isn't recognized.\n   - There are no external inputs, outputs, or data processing beyond this mapping.\n   - The code is static, with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or handling of untrusted data.\n\n2. **Security & Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code is purely declarative and utility-based.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious constructs.\n   - No external dependencies or data sources.\n   - The function handles unknown codes gracefully, which is standard practice.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Given the absence of any malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward and readable, so 0 is justified.\n   - **Risk Score:** Since the code doesn't process untrusted input or perform any risky operations, a risk score of 0 is correct.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports consistently state that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.\n   - The only minor point is that the function returns an integer if the code isn't recognized, which is standard and not risky.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a standard, well-structured utility module for handling HTTP/2 error codes.\n   - There are no security vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation present.\n   - The reported scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- I agree with the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis supply chain security report correctly identifies the code as benign, with no malicious or security issues. The code is a straightforward enumeration and helper function, with no exploitable flaws.",
