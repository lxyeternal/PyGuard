  "purpose": "Define and manage HTTP/2 error codes with an enumeration and a helper function to retrieve error code instances from integers.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data output or external system interactions that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "N/A - The function _error_code_from_int simply maps integers to enum members or returns the integer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, defining constants and a simple helper function.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enumeration for HTTP/2 error codes, providing a structured way to handle known error codes. The helper function _error_code_from_int attempts to convert an integer to an enum member, returning the integer if the code is unknown. The code does not process external input, perform network operations, or handle sensitive data. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured enumeration for HTTP/2 error codes with a safe utility function. It poses no security threat or malicious behavior.",
