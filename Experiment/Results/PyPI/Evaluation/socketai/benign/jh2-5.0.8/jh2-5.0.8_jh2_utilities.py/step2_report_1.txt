  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states the code handles HTTP/2 header validation, security, and normalization, matching the code's functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external actions or data leaks; no execution of untrusted code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code enforces RFC 7540 and employs standard security practices like forbidding connection headers, uppercase headers, and malformed headers.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that the code is standard, secure, and free of malicious intent is accurate.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — reasonable given the thorough validation.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code's content. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on header validation and management.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity; code aligns with RFC standards.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is RFC-compliant, secure, and free of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-reasoned, consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Focuses on header validation, normalization, flow control.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious patterns; flow control safeguards are standard.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is secure, with no signs of sabotage.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Utility functions for header validation, normalization, and flow control.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious activity; header handling is RFC-compliant.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is standard and secure.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate evaluation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar focus on validation, normalization, security.\n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity; functions align with RFC standards.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code appears legitimate and security-focused.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code contains no suspicious patterns, code execution, or network activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports agree on 0; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0, reflecting the importance of header validation but still very low, given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, standard, and readable.\n- **Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** — low, primarily due to the complexity of header validation, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.15 (average of the reports' scores, rounded)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a robust, RFC-compliant, security-conscious HTTP/2 header utility module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score reflects the inherent complexity but no actual security issues.",
