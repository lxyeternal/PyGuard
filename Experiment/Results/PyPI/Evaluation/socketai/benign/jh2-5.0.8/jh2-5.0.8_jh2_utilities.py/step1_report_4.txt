  "purpose": "Utility functions for handling, validating, and transforming HTTP/2 headers, including security-related header processing and flow control management.",
  "sources": "Import statements, regular expressions, header list iteration, and header value manipulations such as extraction, validation, and normalization.",
  "sinks": "Header validation functions that can raise ProtocolError on invalid headers, header transformation functions, and header set modifications, including cookie handling and header filtering.",
  "flows": "Input headers → validation functions (e.g., _reject_* and _check_*) → potential exception raising or header modification → output headers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. The code performs standard header validation, filtering, and normalization aligned with RFCs. Use of `popitem()` in SizeLimitDict is benign. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution found.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard header processing functions for HTTP/2, including header validation, normalization, and flow control checks. It enforces RFC compliance, prevents malformed headers, and manages header indexing and cookie normalization. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors are present. The code is consistent with typical server-side header handling, with no suspicious or harmful logic. The only potential concern could be header modifications, but they align with RFC standards and do not leak information or perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured implementation of HTTP/2 header validation and normalization functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code appears to serve its intended purpose of secure header processing without malicious intent.",
