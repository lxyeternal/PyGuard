  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as utility functions for HTTP/2 header validation, normalization, and security enforcement.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or malware indicators are present.\n- The code adheres to RFC standards (RFC 7540, RFC 7230, RFC 8441).\n- The functions perform validation, normalization, and security measures, with proper error handling.\n- The reports' confidence levels are high (mostly above 0.9), and malware scores are zero across all reports.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is standard for HTTP/2 header handling.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does not execute untrusted code, send data over the network, or write to files.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n- The header validation and normalization logic is consistent with protocol specifications.\n- The SizeLimitDict enforces size constraints without malicious intent.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- Slight variations in the security risk scores (0.1 to 0.2) reflect minor differences in perceived risk, but all are low.\n- No report suggests any vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a score of 0, which is justified given the absence of malicious code, suspicious patterns, or external network activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, standard code.\n- **Risk:** Very low, as the code is primarily validation and normalization logic, with no evident attack vectors or security flaws.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a standard, well-implemented set of HTTP/2 header utilities.\n- No evidence of supply chain sabotage, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The high confidence and low scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (slightly above zero due to potential misconfiguration or implementation flaws, but overall very low)\n\nThis code appears secure, standard, and free of malicious intent. No modifications to the scores are necessary based on the reports.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a legitimate, RFC-compliant HTTP/2 header utility module.\n- No malicious or sabotage activity detected.\n- The security posture is strong, with no significant risks identified.",
