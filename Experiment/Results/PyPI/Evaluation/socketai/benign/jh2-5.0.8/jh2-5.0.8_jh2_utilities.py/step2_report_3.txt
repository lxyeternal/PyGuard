  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's behavior, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes header validation, security measures, and RFC compliance.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation. Functions enforce protocol compliance and security best practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The code strictly handles header validation, normalization, and security according to RFCs. No signs of malicious activity. The low security risk score (0.1) seems appropriate given the functions' nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to report 1, focusing on header handling and validation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation. The code is RFC-compliant and secure.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with report 1; no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk remains low and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Header validation, normalization, flow control, size-limited dict.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The flow control logic guards against large window increments, which is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a typical, RFC-compliant header utility with no malicious indicators. The low security risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Header validation, normalization, cookie handling, security measures.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity, code injection, or sabotage. Header processing aligns with RFC standards.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The functions are standard and secure. No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Header validation, normalization, security measures.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code enforces RFC rules and security best practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.95.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a standard, security-focused header utility. No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code shows no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, and the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation (0.1 or 0.2), justified by the functions' nature—strict validation and security enforcement—but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Code is clear, standard, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.1 to 0.2** — Slightly elevated due to the potential for header-related issues but justified by the code's purpose and implementation.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — the code is a standard, RFC-compliant utility with minimal security risk, primarily related to header validation.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a secure, RFC-compliant HTTP/2 header utility module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low risk score is appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
