{
  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for handling, validating, and normalizing HTTP/2 headers, as well as some related constants and helper classes for managing header data and flow control windows.",
  "sources": "Reading header tuples, extracting method, authority, and path headers, validating headers, and processing header data for outbound and inbound flows.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted header data that is validated, normalized, and possibly used in network transmissions or stored in data structures like SizeLimitDict.",
  "flows": "Header input -> Validation and normalization functions -> Headers used for network communication or stored in data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code strictly adheres to HTTP/2 specifications for header validation and manipulation. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions for managing HTTP/2 headers with validation, normalization, and security checks based on RFC standards. It includes regular expressions for validation, functions for enforcing header rules, and classes for managing header data with size limits. The security checks are appropriate, such as forbidding connection-specific headers, uppercase header names, and ensuring required pseudo-headers are present. There are no suspicious code flows, external network calls, or data leaks; the functions serve as safe, specification-compliant helpers. All functions perform expected header processing tasks without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a well-structured, RFC-compliant header utility module with no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It focuses solely on header validation, normalization, and management in accordance with HTTP/2 standards, with no suspicious activities or security threats detected.",
