{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for handling HTTP/2 headers, including validation, normalization, and security measures for header processing in an HTTP/2 protocol implementation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from header tuples, such as header names and values, during header validation, extraction, and normalization functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that raise ProtocolError on invalid headers, such as _reject_* functions, and header value transformations in normalization functions.",
  "flows": "Input headers are validated and transformed through various functions that enforce RFC compliance; errors are raised if validation fails, otherwise headers are normalized or returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors detected. Use of regex for uppercase detection and multiple validation functions are standard. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns found.",
  "analysis": "The code performs comprehensive header validation following RFC 7540 and related RFCs, including checks for header name casing, presence of pseudo-headers, correct header sequences, and header value constraints. It includes header normalization functions like lowercasing and whitespace stripping, as well as security-focused modifications such as marking headers as never-indexed. All functions raise ProtocolError on validation failures, ensuring strict adherence to protocol rules. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed. The functions are consistent with typical HTTP/2 header processing routines, with no signs of data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of HTTP/2 header validation and normalization, with security considerations like header security and strict protocol compliance. No malicious or sabotage behavior detected. It appears to be a legitimate, security-focused utility module.",
