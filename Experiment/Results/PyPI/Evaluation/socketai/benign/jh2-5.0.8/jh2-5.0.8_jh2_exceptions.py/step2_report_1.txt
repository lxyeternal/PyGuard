  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as defining exception classes for HTTP/2 protocol errors.\n- No untrusted data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is straightforward, primarily class definitions with attributes and string representations.\n- Error codes are imported from a presumably legitimate ErrorCodes module.\n- The purpose is to facilitate error handling, not to process data or perform operations that could be malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Logical Checks:\n\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  The code only defines exception classes; no operational logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. The issues reported as \"security risks\" or \"malware\" are not supported by the code content.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No evident errors or flaws. The code is standard, well-structured, with proper inheritance and documentation.\n\n- **Scores assigned to issues:**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores as 0 or 0.5, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. No adjustments needed.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports justify higher scores because no malicious or risky behavior is present.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  All reports correctly avoid assuming vulnerabilities; they focus on the code's purpose as exception definitions.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the analysis; no anomalies or discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- The code does **not** process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n- Exception classes are standard and do not contain any suspicious logic.\n- No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns are evident.\n- The purpose is purely to define error types for an HTTP/2 implementation.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — standard exception definitions pose no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nAll reports correctly identify that this code is a benign, standard exception class hierarchy for HTTP/2 protocol error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities within this fragment.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis, confirming that the code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
