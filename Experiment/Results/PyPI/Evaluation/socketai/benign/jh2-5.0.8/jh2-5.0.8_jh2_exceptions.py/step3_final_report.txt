{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for HTTP/2 protocol errors, facilitating error handling within the module.",
  "sources": "Import of ErrorCodes module; class attributes and initializations; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing; exception raising occurs locally within the application context.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and raising; no external data flow or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for various HTTP/2 protocol errors, with attributes such as error codes and stream IDs. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The structure is standard, with clear inheritance and documentation. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The error codes are imported from a separate module, presumably legitimate. Overall, the code serves as a straightforward exception hierarchy for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard implementation of exception classes for HTTP/2 error management. There are no indicators of malicious intent, supply chain compromise, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and risk scores are all zero, reflecting its safe and conventional nature.",
