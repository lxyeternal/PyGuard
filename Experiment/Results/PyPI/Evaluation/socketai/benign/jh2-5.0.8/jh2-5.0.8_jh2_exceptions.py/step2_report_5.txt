  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Content:**\n   - The code only defines exception classes for HTTP/2 protocol errors.\n   - No external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The exception classes are straightforward, with attributes and string representations typical for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**\n   - The code appears well-structured, with proper inheritance, error codes, and documentation.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n   - Exception classes are standard and do not introduce any vulnerabilities.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0 or 0.5; given the code's nature, 0 is justified.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Concerns:**\n   - Since these are exception classes, their misuse could cause issues elsewhere, but within this code fragment, there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n   - The only minor note is that exceptions could be misused in a broader context, but that’s outside the scope of this code.\n\n5. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The code is a standard, clean implementation of exception classes for an HTTP/2 module.\n   - No signs of supply chain attacks, malicious code, or security risks.\n   - The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is safe, well-structured, and typical for its purpose. No changes to the scores are necessary.",
