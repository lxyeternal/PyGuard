{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various HTTP/2 protocol errors in a Python module.",
  "sources": "Import from __future__ for annotations, import of ErrorCodes, class definitions, and their attributes.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Exception classes are used for control flow within error handling; no data flow from sources to sinks relevant to security.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. Exception classes are straightforward, with no obfuscated code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes a hierarchy of custom exceptions for HTTP/2 protocol handling, with clear structure and documentation. It utilizes class inheritance, includes version annotations, and defines error codes for various protocol errors. No input handling, data processing, or network operations are present that could indicate malicious activity. The classes serve purely for exception handling, with no evidence of malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured set of exception classes for an HTTP/2 module. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The implementation is typical for error handling and does not contain obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
