{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various HTTP/2 protocol errors and related conditions.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ and local module .errors for error codes.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly reads untrusted input or data from external sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; mainly class and exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception class definitions for an HTTP/2 protocol implementation, with clear documentation and no dynamic or malicious code. The classes are standard Python exceptions, with no evidence of data leaks, injections, or backdoors. The only potential concern might be if these exceptions are misused elsewhere, but within this fragment, no malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of exception classes for HTTP/2 errors with no signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, well-documented module intended for error handling.",
