{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the HTTP/2 protocol handling, including specific error types and error codes.",
  "sources": "Importing ErrorCodes from .errors module; exception class constructors and attributes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that lead to untrusted data leaks or malicious actions; exceptions are for error handling.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and raising, with some data passed into constructors (e.g., stream_id, msg, error_code).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the code consists solely of exception class definitions with standard attributes and methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for the HTTP/2 protocol, including detailed subclasses for specific error conditions. It uses conventional Python class structures, with no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or network interactions. The only data passed into some exceptions are identifiers or messages, which are standard. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors are detected. The code appears to be a well-structured, standard exception module for protocol error handling, with no anomalies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for HTTP/2 error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is clean, standard, and focused on error representation without harmful side effects.",
