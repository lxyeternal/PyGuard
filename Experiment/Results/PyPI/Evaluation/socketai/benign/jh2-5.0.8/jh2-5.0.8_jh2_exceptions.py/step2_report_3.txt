  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a set of exception classes for HTTP/2 protocol error handling.\n- The code is straightforward, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution.\n- Error codes are imported from a presumably legitimate ErrorCodes module.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- Exception classes are standard and serve purely for error categorization.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. The code is purely class definitions for exceptions, with no operational logic that could be malicious.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or flaws:** None identified. The reasoning that this code is safe and standard is sound.\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the analysis that there's no security risk.\n\n### Potential Risks and Assumptions:\n- The reports correctly assume that since the code only defines exception classes, it does not pose a security threat.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent across reports and with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n### Additional Expert Justification:\n- The code is a standard exception hierarchy, typical in protocol implementations.\n- No external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- Error codes are imported from a separate module, which, assuming correctness, does not introduce risk.\n- No signs of supply chain compromise or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nBased on the detailed review, I concur with the provided assessments. The code is a standard, benign set of exception classes with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis confirms the code's safety and appropriateness for its intended purpose.",
