{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the HTTP/2 protocol handling, including error types and error codes.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__ and .errors; class definitions and initializations; exception raising mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "String representations (__str__ methods); potential error handling that could be triggered by untrusted input if used improperly.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and raising could occur upon protocol violations or unexpected conditions, but there is no direct data flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors; the code is a standard exception hierarchy. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual patterns. The only potential concern could be if exceptions are misused elsewhere, but within this code, nothing suspicious is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for HTTP/2 protocol errors, with appropriate error codes and messages. It uses standard Python exception patterns, with constructors for custom error information. There are no external inputs processed, no data transformations, and no network or system calls. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The overall structure is consistent with good coding practices for exception handling. Since the code only defines error classes and no operational or network logic, the likelihood of malicious behavior is extremely low.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical exception class hierarchy for handling HTTP/2 protocol errors. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks within this module. It appears to be a safe and standard implementation.",
