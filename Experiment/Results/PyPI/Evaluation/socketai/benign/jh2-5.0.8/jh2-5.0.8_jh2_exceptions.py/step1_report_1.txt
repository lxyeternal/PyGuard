{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling various HTTP/2 protocol errors in an HTTP/2 module.",
  "sources": "Importing ErrorCodes from .errors module, class initializations, and string representations.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing, external data output, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Instantiation and raising of exception classes, string conversions, and attribute assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns. Use of exception classes is standard. No obfuscated code or hidden data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exception classes inheriting from base exception classes, with some classes initializing attributes and providing string representations. No external data inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. Error codes are assigned from a presumably legitimate ErrorCodes module. The code appears to be straightforward, focusing on exception handling for HTTP/2 protocol errors. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or suspicious activity are detected. The overall structure and content are typical for protocol error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of exception classes for HTTP/2 protocol error handling with no malicious intent or suspicious activity. It simply defines error types with associated attributes and messages. No malware, supply chain attacks, or security risks are identified.",
