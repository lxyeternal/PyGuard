  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and security risks.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines exception classes for HTTP/2 errors, importing ErrorCodes, standard class attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data processing or network activity; exception raising is standard.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Straightforward exception hierarchy with no malicious intent. No signs of malware or security risks.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard exception class definitions, no external data or network activity.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: exception classes for protocol errors, no data leaks, no dynamic code.\n- No anomalies or malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Defines detailed exception classes with attributes, no external data or network calls.\n- No suspicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to previous reports, exception class definitions for error handling.\n- No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code's nature—defining exception classes—this is expected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; all reports assign 0, which is accurate.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n### Additional Justification:\n- The code is a standard exception hierarchy for HTTP/2 protocol errors.\n- No suspicious patterns, no embedded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- No evidence of supply chain compromise or malicious payloads.\n- The code's purpose is purely to facilitate error handling, which is typical and safe.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis, confirming the code's benign and standard nature.",
