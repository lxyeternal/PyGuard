  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation using Sphinx for the 'mac_alias' project.",
  "sources": "Reads project version info from '../src/mac_alias/__init__.py', system modules (os, re, sys).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. No network, file write, or environment variable misuse observed.",
  "flows": "Reads version string from source file; configuration data flows into documentation build process. No untrusted data flow into critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, sets up paths, loads version info from a source file, and configures documentation options. All operations are typical for documentation setup. No anomalies or malicious patterns identified. The code's purpose is solely configuration, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a normal, benign Sphinx configuration file with no signs of malware or security risks. It reads version info securely and sets up documentation parameters without performing any unsafe or suspicious actions.",
