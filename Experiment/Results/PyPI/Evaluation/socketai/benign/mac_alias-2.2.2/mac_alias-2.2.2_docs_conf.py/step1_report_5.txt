  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation using Sphinx for the 'mac_alias' project.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from '../src/mac_alias/__init__.py', imports standard libraries (os, re, sys), and sets up Sphinx configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Reads version string from project source file, configures documentation parameters, and sets paths for static and template files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. The code primarily manages configuration variables and file paths.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and modifies sys.path to include a parent directory. It reads version information from a project source file using regex, which is a typical practice. Configuration settings for Sphinx (extensions, paths, output formats) are static and standard. No dynamic execution, network activity, or credential handling is present. The code is solely for documentation build configuration with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious or suspicious elements. It primarily sets up paths, extensions, and output options for documentation generation. There are no indicators of malware, security risks, or obfuscation.",
