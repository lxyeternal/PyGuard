  "purpose": "Configuration script for building documentation with Sphinx for the 'mac_alias' project.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '../src/mac_alias/__init__.py'; reads system environment; reads files from filesystem (e.g., version file, static files).",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is written to external systems, network, or stored insecurely.",
  "flows": "Reads version string from source file -> uses in documentation setup; reads static files and configuration parameters for documentation build process.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; the script strictly handles documentation setup and configuration, with no code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard Sphinx configuration tasks, including importing modules, setting paths, loading project version info, configuring HTML/LaTeX/manual/Texinfo outputs, and defining documentation parameters. No dynamic code execution, external network connections, or handling of secrets is observed. The code adheres to typical configuration patterns and contains no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Sphinx documentation configuration file with no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely manages build settings and resource paths, with no external or unsafe operations.",
