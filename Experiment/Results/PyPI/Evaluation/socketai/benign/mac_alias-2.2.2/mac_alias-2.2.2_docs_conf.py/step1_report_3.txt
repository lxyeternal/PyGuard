  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; standard configuration practices followed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Sphinx configuration script with no dynamic code execution, no network calls, and no hardcoded secrets. The only file read occurs in a safe context to extract version info from a local file. No embedded obfuscation or malicious logic is present. The code structure is straightforward and serves only documentation setup purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, serving as a configuration for documentation generation. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
