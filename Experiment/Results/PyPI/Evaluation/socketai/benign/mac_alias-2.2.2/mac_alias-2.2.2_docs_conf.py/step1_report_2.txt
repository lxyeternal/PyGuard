  "purpose": "Configuration for building documentation using Sphinx for the 'mac_alias' project.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from ../src/mac_alias/__init__.py; importing standard modules os, re, sys; inserting parent directory into sys.path.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions observed.",
  "flows": "Version info read from file (source) used to set release and version variables; sys.path modified to include parent directory.",
  "anomalies": "None observed. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors present. The code strictly performs configuration tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Sphinx configuration file, setting up documentation parameters such as extensions, paths, project info, and output options. It reads version info from a specific Python file but does so securely using regex and encoding. There are no indications of code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity. The only notable activity is reading version information from the source code, which is standard for documentation builds. No external network connections, file manipulations beyond configuration, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script for documentation generation. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
