  "purpose": "Defines a UTC timezone class and establishes epoch datetime objects for Mac, Unix, and OSX epochs.",
  "sources": "Constants ZERO, datetime module, and class UTC initialization.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving external input or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a UTC timezone class with fixed offset and daylight saving methods, then defines three epoch datetime objects corresponding to Mac, Unix, and OSX epochs, using the custom UTC timezone. All parts of the code are straightforward, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious activity. No external data handling, no code injection, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be a utility setup for datetime operations, common in many projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily setting up timezone and epoch constants without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
