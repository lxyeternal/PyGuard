  "purpose": "Define a UTC timezone class with fixed offset and DST methods, and initialize epoch datetime constants for Mac, Unix, and OSX systems in UTC.",
  "sources": "No external inputs; static class definition and datetime initializations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward implementation with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a custom UTC tzinfo class with fixed offset and DST methods, returning zero timedelta, which is standard for UTC. It then creates three datetime objects representing different system epoch start dates, all in UTC timezone. There are no external inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. The code is simple, utility-oriented, and uses standard library features. No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious activity are present. The implementation is correct and typical for such utility definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for defining UTC timezone info and epoch constants. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and justified.",
