  "purpose": "Defines UTC timezone class and initializes epoch datetime objects for different calendar standards (Mac, Unix, OS X).",
  "sources": "Imports the datetime module; creates a UTC tzinfo class; defines constants and epoch datetime objects.",
  "sinks": "No external data inputs or outputs; no data sinks or leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; mainly static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The epoch definitions are standard and static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a UTC timezone class with fixed offset and DST methods, which is standard. It then creates three datetime objects representing different epoch standards: Mac (1904), Unix (1970), and OS X (2001). All are initialized with the UTC timezone object. There are no inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are apparent. The code appears to be utility or configuration code for handling different epoch timestamps.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility defining timezone info and epoch start times for various systems. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
