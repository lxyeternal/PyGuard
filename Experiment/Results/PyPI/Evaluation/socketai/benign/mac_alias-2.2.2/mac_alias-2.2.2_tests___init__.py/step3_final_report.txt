  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, subprocess calls, socket interactions, data processing routines.",
  "sinks": "System commands via subprocess, network communications, environment variable access, potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data from environment variables or user input flowing into subprocess or socket functions.",
  "anomalies": "Potential untrusted data handling, use of environment variables and network functions, but no explicit obfuscation or malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. Scores are consistent with descriptions: malware=0, obfuscated=0. Risk scores vary slightly (0.2-0.4), with the higher in report 3 justified by potential misuse of untrusted data sources. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited code details. Slight adjustment suggested for report 3's risk score from 0.4 to 0.3 to reflect cautious but benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates no malicious code or obfuscation present. The security risk remains low (~0.2-0.3), primarily due to potential misuse of untrusted data, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are confirmed. The reports are consistent and reasonable; a minor risk score adjustment for report 3 improves alignment with the evidence.",
