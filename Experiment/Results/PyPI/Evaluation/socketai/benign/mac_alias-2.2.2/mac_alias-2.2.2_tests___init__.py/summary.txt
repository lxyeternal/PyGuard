  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates no malicious code or obfuscation present. The security risk remains low (~0.2-0.3), primarily due to potential misuse of untrusted data, but no active vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are confirmed. The reports are consistent and reasonable; a minor risk score adjustment for report 3 improves alignment with the evidence."
