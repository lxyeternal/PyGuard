{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initialization module, importing submodules and defining metadata and exported symbols for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.alias and .bookmark), static version string, predefined symbol list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flows or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and symbol definitions, with no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for a package __init__.py.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple package setup file that imports all from two local modules, defines a version, and specifies exported symbols. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns. All security and malware scores are zero, consistent with the benign nature of the code. The imported modules are unknown, but no malicious behavior is evident from this fragment. The code is transparent, with no obfuscation or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package initialization script with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
