{
  "purpose": "The code primarily defines an API surface for a module related to aliases and bookmarks, setting version information and exporting constants and classes.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or other effects are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and sets constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no unusual or suspicious operations, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports all contents from local modules 'alias' and 'bookmark', sets a version string, and defines a list of exportable symbols. It appears to serve as an initializer or interface definition without any data processing, network operations, or sensitive handling. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module setup file with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply exposes constants and classes for other parts of the application.",
