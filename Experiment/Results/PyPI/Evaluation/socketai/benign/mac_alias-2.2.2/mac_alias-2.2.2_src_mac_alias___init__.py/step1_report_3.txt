{
  "purpose": "The code primarily sets up module imports and defines metadata and export variables for a Python package related to aliases and bookmarks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules '.alias' and '.bookmark'. No external data sources or input reading found.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply imports and defines constants and metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. No dynamic code execution, network access, or external dependencies beyond imports.",
  "analysis": "The script imports from local modules and defines package metadata and an __all__ list of constants and variables. No input processing, network operations, or sensitive data handling occurs. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package module setup, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It solely manages exports and metadata for the package.",
