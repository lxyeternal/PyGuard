  "purpose": "Create a simple alias object for a specified file path.",
  "sources": "Importing the Alias class from the mac_alias module; calling Alias.for_file() with a hardcoded path.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input handling or data output to external systems observed.",
  "flows": "Import Alias -> Call Alias.for_file with a fixed path -> Return alias object.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. No obfuscation or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a standard module, then creates an alias object for a fixed directory path, which appears to be for testing purposes. No external input handling or data exfiltration is present. The code performs straightforward object creation and assertion without any suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple object instantiation for testing purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
