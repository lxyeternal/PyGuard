{
  "purpose": "This code defines imports and exports for an AMQP client library, including exceptions, connection, channel classes, and constants.",
  "sources": "Import statements from external library 'pamqp', relative imports of local modules and classes, and exception definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network connections, or data sinks are explicitly present; the code mainly imports and re-exports components.",
  "flows": "The code does not contain data flow logic; it only sets up module imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and __all__ exports for module components, which is standard in Python package __init__.py files. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execute dynamic code. No sources or sinks of untrusted data are present. No anomalies or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module setup for an AMQP client library, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
