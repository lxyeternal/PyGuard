  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically, focusing on the presence of malicious code, logical flaws, or suspicious patterns, and verify the consistency of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines abstract classes and data structures for a RabbitMQ client; no implementation logic.\n- **Analysis:** No dynamic code, no network operations, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, purely structural code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's nature. The low security risk score (0.1) is appropriate, given the absence of active logic or data handling.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1—framework for an AMQP client.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no suspicious data flows.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. The code is a standard abstract framework.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Abstract classes for an asyncio AMQP client.\n- **Analysis:** No active network code, no dynamic execution, no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard framework.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) is still justified given the potential for subclasses to implement malicious code, but the base code itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Abstract classes for an asyncio RabbitMQ client.\n- **Analysis:** No concrete logic, no data leaks, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, non-malicious framework.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate; the code is purely structural.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar abstract framework.\n- **Analysis:** No implementation, no network operations, no malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Low security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the abstract nature and potential for subclass extension, but no active threats.\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a well-structured, abstract foundation for a RabbitMQ client, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or active vulnerabilities.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (consistent with minimal inherent risk in a purely abstract, unimplemented framework)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious. No further action or heightened risk assessment is necessary based on this code snippet.",
