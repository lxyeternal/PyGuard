{
  "purpose": "Defines abstract classes and data structures for a RabbitMQ client; no implementation logic.",
  "sources": "Class and data structure definitions, no runtime data input or external data reads.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; purely structural code.",
  "flows": "No active data or network flows; only class and method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of abstract base classes and data containers for an asyncio-based RabbitMQ client library. It contains no executable logic, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The absence of malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling indicates a benign, structural framework intended for extension. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are justified. The low risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects minimal inherent danger, consistent with a non-implementing, abstract module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious foundation for a RabbitMQ client library. No signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise are present. The scores and assessments across all reports are accurate and appropriate.",
