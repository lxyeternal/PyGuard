{
  "purpose": "This code issues a deprecation warning for the module aiormq.types and suggests using aiormq.abc instead.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module namespace to import all symbols from .abc and issues a warning.",
  "sinks": "The warning function could potentially be a sink if it were manipulated, but here it is used normally to alert developers.",
  "flows": "The import statement loads symbols from a local module, and the warnings.warn function outputs a deprecation message.",
  "anomalies": "The import uses a wildcard which could obscure the actual imported symbols; however, this is a common pattern for API deprecation notices. No malicious code or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a sibling module named .abc, then issues a deprecation warning indicating that aiormq.types is deprecated and will be removed in future releases. The warning encourages users to switch to aiormq.abc. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious data handling. The only notable aspect is the use of 'import *', which is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward deprecation notice with an import statement. It does not contain any malicious activity or security risks. The only minor concern is the use of 'import *', but it does not impact security.",
