{
  "purpose": "This code issues a deprecation warning for the module aiormq.types and recommends using aiormq.abc instead.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the current module's namespace and calls the warnings.warn() function.",
  "sinks": "The warnings.warn() function outputs a warning message, typically to standard error, which can be seen by the user or system logs.",
  "flows": "The module import and the deprecation warning are straightforward; there are no untrusted data sources, and the warning is a controlled output.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors present. The import uses a relative import with a noqa comment, which is standard in many codebases.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with an import of the warnings module, then performs a relative import of all contents from a module named .abc with a noqa comment indicating linter suppression. It then issues a DeprecationWarning message indicating that aiormq.types is deprecated and will be removed, suggesting to use aiormq.abc instead. The warning includes a stacklevel=2 argument to point the warning to the caller’s location. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues; the code is standard for deprecation notices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward deprecation warning implementation with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a normal part of package maintenance to notify users of deprecated features.",
