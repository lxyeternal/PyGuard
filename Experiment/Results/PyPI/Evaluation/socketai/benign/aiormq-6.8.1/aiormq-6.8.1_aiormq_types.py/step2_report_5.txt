  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code's behavior, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a simple module that imports everything from a sibling module `.abc` and issues a deprecation warning about `aiormq.types`.\n- All reports agree that the code does not process external data, perform network operations, or handle sensitive information.\n- The use of `import *` is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- The code's purpose is solely to inform users about deprecation, which is a standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n\n- **Are the issues reported actually present?**  \n  Yes. The code imports `*` from `.abc` and issues a deprecation warning. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.  \n  **Confirmed:** No issues beyond standard deprecation warning.\n\n#### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and only issues a warning.\n- They note that `import *` is generally discouraged but not harmful here.\n- No logical errors or misinterpretations are apparent.\n\n#### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0 or very low, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Security Risk:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (full confidence) for all, justified by the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n#### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**\n\n- All reports assign 0 to malware and security risk, which is justified.\n- The code only issues a deprecation warning; no actual security vulnerability exists.\n- The highest confidence is justified given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n#### 5. **Malware Score Reflection**\n\n- No signs of malicious code, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- The only potential concern could be the use of `import *`, which can sometimes be risky if the imported module is malicious, but in this context, it's standard and safe.\n\n**Conclusion:** Malware score should remain 0.\n\n#### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n\n- No suspicious assumptions are made; all reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- The warnings are standard deprecation notices.\n\n#### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**\n\n- All reports assign scores consistent with their reasoning.\n- The only minor discrepancy is report 5's confidence (0.9 vs. 1), which is acceptable given the use of `import *`.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward deprecation warning module with a relative import. It is entirely benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**  | **0**        | **0** |\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe reports are accurate and appropriately scored. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, clear, and standard for deprecation notices. The scores reflect this accurately.",
