  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the provided assessments.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports all symbols from a sibling module `.abc` using a wildcard import.\n- Issues a `DeprecationWarning` indicating that `aiormq.types` is deprecated and will be removed, advising to use `aiormq.abc` instead.\n- No external input, no data processing, no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- The code's purpose is solely to warn users about deprecation.\n- The import uses a wildcard (`from .abc import *`), which is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- The warning is standard practice for library evolution.\n- No signs of malware, data leaks, or malicious behavior.\n- No external data or untrusted inputs are involved.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Correctly states the code issues a deprecation warning.\n- Sources/Sinks/Flows: No external data involved.\n- Anomalies: No anomalies, just a wildcard import.\n- Analysis: Accurate; no malicious intent.\n- Conclusion: Benign, safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1; emphasizes the lack of external input and benign nature.\n- Notes poor practice of wildcard import but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar assessment; confirms no malicious behavior.\n- Highlights standard deprecation pattern.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates the straightforward nature of the warning.\n- Mentions the use of `warnings.warn()` and relative import.\n- No anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar analysis; notes the use of `import *` but considers it a minor concern, not malicious.\n- No suspicious behaviors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is benign and solely issues a deprecation warning.\n- The only potential concern is the use of `from .abc import *`, which is generally discouraged but not malicious.\n- No report suggests any malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard deprecation warning with benign behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the overall benign nature of the code.",
