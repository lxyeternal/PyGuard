  "purpose": "Issue a deprecation warning for 'aiormq.types' and import symbols from the sibling module '.abc'.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .abc import *' and the warnings.warn() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Import from '.abc' (source) to the module namespace; warning issued to the user.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('import *'), which is generally discouraged but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward deprecation warning and imports symbols from a sibling module. No external input, network activity, or malicious code is present. The wildcard import is a style concern but not security-related. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected. The code's purpose is solely to inform users about deprecation, with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a deprecation notice with a standard import and warning. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
