{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning about the 'aiormq.types' module and suggests using 'aiormq.abc' instead.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports all symbols from a relative module and generates a warning message.",
  "sinks": "The warning message is generated but does not lead to any security-sensitive actions or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the warning is purely informational and does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present. The use of a wildcard import (*) could be considered poor practice but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and issues a deprecation warning regarding a module rename. It does not process user input, handle untrusted data, or perform any network or file operations. The wildcard import might be seen as a code quality concern but does not introduce security risks. There are no signs of malicious intent or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is benign and solely issues a deprecation warning. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security threats, or suspicious activity.",
