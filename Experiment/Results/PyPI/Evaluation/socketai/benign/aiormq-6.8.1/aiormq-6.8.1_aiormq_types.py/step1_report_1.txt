{
  "purpose": "The code issues a deprecation warning for the 'aiormq.types' module and suggests using 'aiormq.abc' instead.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a module and issues a warning.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process or output untrusted data; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports and warns.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all definitions from a sibling module 'abc' and issues a deprecation warning indicating that 'aiormq.types' is deprecated and will be removed in the future, guiding users to switch to 'aiormq.abc'. The warning is standard practice for library evolution. No external data is read, and there are no suspicious code patterns or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to inform users about deprecation of a module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
