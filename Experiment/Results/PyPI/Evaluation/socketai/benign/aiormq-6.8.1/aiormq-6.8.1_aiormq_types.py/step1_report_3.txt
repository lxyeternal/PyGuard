{
  "purpose": "This code issues a deprecation warning about the 'aiormq.types' module and suggests using 'aiormq.abc' instead.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only imports modules and issues a warning.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not write or send data externally.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the warning is issued based on static code execution.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The import statement uses a relative import, which is standard in package modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local module '.abc', then issues a deprecation warning indicating that 'aiormq.types' is deprecated and will be removed, advising to use 'aiormq.abc' instead. There are no indications of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The warning mechanism is a standard practice to inform users of deprecated features. No external data input or dangerous operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard deprecation warning in a module, with no malicious intent or security risks. The code is straightforward and safe.",
