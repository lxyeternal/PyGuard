  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, code is well-structured, standard async utilities.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** Valid, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard async utilities, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — acceptable.\n- **Assessment:** Valid, no issues.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard utility functions, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Utility functions for async operations, platform-specific timing, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, benign utility code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's content—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Very low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is standard for asynchronous utility functions, with platform-specific timing considerations that are well-understood and not suspicious.\n- No evidence of backdoors, malicious data handling, or obfuscation.\n- The use of asyncio primitives and URL handling is typical for such utility modules.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (appropriate, given the utility nature and no malicious indicators)\n\n**In conclusion,** the scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis code appears safe, benign, and standard for its intended purpose.",
