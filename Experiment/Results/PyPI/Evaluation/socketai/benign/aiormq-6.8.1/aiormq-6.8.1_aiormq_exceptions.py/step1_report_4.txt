{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling AMQP protocol errors and connection/channel issues.",
  "sources": "None (this is purely class and exception definitions).",
  "sinks": "None (no data flows or external data handling occurs in this code).",
  "flows": "None (no input/output or data flow logic present).",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting with %s and %r in class attributes, but no dynamic code execution or data processing that could lead to injection. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for AMQP errors, with descriptive reasons and custom __repr__ methods for representation. The class DeliveryError captures message and frame data, and PublishError asserts that message.delivery is of a specific type. The overall structure is standard for error handling, with no signs of malicious intent. No external input handling, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The exception messages are static or formatted with class data, not external inputs. No suspicious behaviors or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard exception class hierarchy for AMQP protocol error handling. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, and appears to be a legitimate part of an AMQP client library. No security risks or malware are evident.",
