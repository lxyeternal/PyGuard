{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various AMQP protocol errors and connection issues",
  "sources": "None; the code consists of class definitions and string formatting for error messages",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted in a security-sensitive manner",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines error classes without runtime data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or hidden functionalities observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines numerous custom exception classes for AMQP protocol error handling, including specific errors related to connection, channel, and protocol issues. Error reasons are mostly static strings with some formatting placeholders. The DeliveryError and PublishError classes include attributes to hold message and frame data, but no untrusted data is processed or transmitted. There are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The code appears to be standard exception class definitions meant for robust error handling within an AMQP client or server implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of error class definitions with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data insecurely nor includes suspicious behaviors. No malware or supply chain attacks are detected.",
