{
  "purpose": "This code defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions for handling various AMQP protocol errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "No external input or untrusted data sources are read; the code only defines exception classes and their string representations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs are present; the code does not perform data output or network communication directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the exception classes are for internal error handling and messaging.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected. The code uses standard Python exception handling and class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes related to AMQP protocol errors, including various specific error types with descriptive reasons. No user input, environment variables, or external data processing occurs. The exception messages are static or derived from arguments in a typical way. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, obfuscation, or data leakage mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured exception hierarchy for AMQP error handling. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or supply chain attacks. It functions purely for error representation without external data manipulation or network activities.",
