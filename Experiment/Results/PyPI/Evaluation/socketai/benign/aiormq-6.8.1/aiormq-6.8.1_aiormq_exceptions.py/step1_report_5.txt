  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various AMQP protocol errors and connection issues.",
  "sources": "None (standard class definitions and exception handling; no external input reading).",
  "sinks": "None (no data processing or external data output).",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from sources to sinks; primarily class and exception definitions).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs identified.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions for AMQP-related errors, including connection, channel, protocol, and delivery errors. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, or external data handling. The code adheres to standard Python practices for exception handling and class inheritance. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The purpose appears to be error classification and messaging within a larger AMQP client or server implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward and secure set of exception class definitions used for error reporting in an AMQP protocol context. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as expected for error handling without any suspicious or malicious elements.",
