{
  "purpose": "Defines exception classes for handling various AMQP protocol errors, connection issues, channel errors, delivery errors, and related error messages.",
  "sources": "Attributes like 'message' and 'frame' in DeliveryError and PublishError, which are set during exception instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Formatted error messages that include 'message' and 'frame' attributes, potentially leaking sensitive info if these contain untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Attributes 'message' and 'frame' are stored during exception creation and later formatted into error messages; no external data flow or network activity involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exception attributes 'message' and 'frame' in error messages could leak sensitive information; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for AMQP error handling, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or processing of untrusted data. Exception messages are static or formatted with class attributes, which is standard. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The only minor concern is potential info leakage via exception attributes, but this is typical in error reporting. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. Overall, the code is a benign, standard error handling hierarchy with no security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious set of exception classes for AMQP error handling. It does not process untrusted data in a harmful way, perform network activity, or contain obfuscation. The minor potential for info leakage in error messages is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores are justified and appropriate.",
