{
  "purpose": "Defines authentication mechanisms for a connection, including plain and external methods, with encoding logic.",
  "sources": "Reads user and password from self.connector.url, which are external inputs.",
  "sinks": "Returns encoded credential strings; no untrusted data flow beyond string concatenation.",
  "flows": "Input from connector URL -> encode() -> marshaled string output.",
  "anomalies": "ExternalAuth.encode() returns an empty string, which may be a placeholder but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code implements straightforward authentication classes with no network handling or response processing. The reports of 'Empty response' are external and not caused by this code. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The use of optional credentials and simple string concatenation is standard. The ExternalAuth class returning an empty string might be a placeholder for external auth tokens but does not pose security issues. The overall structure is clear and correct. No obfuscation or malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, correct implementation of authentication classes with no malicious or suspicious elements. The 'Empty response' reports are external and unrelated to this code snippet. The malware score is zero, and risk is minimal. No vulnerabilities or obfuscation are present.",
