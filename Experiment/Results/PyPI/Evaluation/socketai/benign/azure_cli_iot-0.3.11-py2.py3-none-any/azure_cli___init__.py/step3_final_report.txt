  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for Python packaging using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "Importing pkg_resources module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process external input or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Import of pkg_resources → call to declare_namespace(__name__); no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward namespace declaration with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace using declare_namespace(__name__). This is a standard pattern in Python packaging for namespace packages. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or include any suspicious logic. All reports correctly identify this as benign boilerplate code. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code. No anomalies or malicious signals are present. The code poses no security risks and is consistent with typical namespace declaration practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace declaration pattern with no malicious activity or security concerns. The current scores are accurate and appropriate. No further action or scoring adjustments are necessary.",
