  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for the package, allowing multiple distributions to share the same namespace",
  "sources": "The import statement for pkg_resources and the namespace declaration",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident in this minimal code snippet",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace packages; no unusual or suspicious activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace for the current package/module, a common practice for namespace packages in Python. No input, output, or data processing occurs. The code is straightforward, standard, and does not include any obfuscated or malicious constructs. It does not perform network access, file manipulation, or secret handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
