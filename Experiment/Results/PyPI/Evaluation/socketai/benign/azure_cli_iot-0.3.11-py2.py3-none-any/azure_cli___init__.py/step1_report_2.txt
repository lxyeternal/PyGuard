  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, allowing it to be split across multiple distributions.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace' with '__name__'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data output or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow pathways; only namespace declaration occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module from setuptools and declares the current package as a namespace package. This is a standard practice for modular packages. No user input, external data, or suspicious operations are present. The code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical namespace declaration for Python packages and contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
