  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, likely part of a larger package or library.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's name (__name__) to declare a namespace.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing occurring in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs. Declaring namespace is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace' with __name__, which is a standard way to declare a namespace package. This is common in multi-part package distributions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is present. The code performs a benign namespace declaration, typical in open-source packages.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign namespace declaration typical in Python packages. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks in this code.",
