{
  "purpose": "This code integrates Azure IoT CLI extension commands into the Azure CLI framework and manages the display of extension installation warnings.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (knack, azure.cli), function handler reading command context and configuration, and logging warnings.",
  "sinks": "Logging warnings to the console, setting configuration values in the context.",
  "flows": "The handler reads command info and config, then logs a warning and updates config if conditions are met. The command loader registers event handlers and loads command tables and parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code only manages CLI commands and user notifications. No obfuscated code, no malicious network activity, or suspicious data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code's main functions are to notify users about the IoT extension and load CLI commands. It registers an event handler that triggers when commands are parsed, which conditionally logs a warning and updates config. The command loader class correctly registers events and loads command tables and parameters. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security risks are present. The code appears to be a legitimate part of CLI extension management with no hidden or harmful logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI extension setup and notification handler without malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malware, suspicious data flows, or obfuscated code. The only notable activity is user notification via logs, which is safe.",
