  "purpose": "Manage Azure IoT CLI extension setup, including event handling, command registration, and user notifications about extension installation.",
  "sources": "Event handler registration, configuration reads/writes, logging warnings, command and argument loading functions.",
  "sinks": "Logging warnings, updating configuration flags.",
  "flows": "Event handler triggers -> logs warning and sets config -> command table and arguments loaded.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Azure CLI extension component responsible for registering event handlers, loading command tables, and notifying users about the IoT extension. It uses legitimate modules and patterns, with benign logging and configuration updates. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The only notable activity is user notification, which is typical and harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and performs standard extension setup tasks. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with its behavior.",
