  "purpose": "This code initializes and manages IoT-related command modules and extensions for Azure CLI, including a handler for first-time setup notifications.",
  "sources": "Reads from configuration files (ctx.config), command input (kwargs['command']), and imports external modules and extensions.",
  "sinks": "Logs warning messages, modifies configuration values, and registers event handlers.",
  "flows": "Input command triggers the handler, which reads command strings and configuration; the handler may log warnings and update configs based on conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; the code performs standard CLI extension setup and logging.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages command registration and extension prompts without hardcoded credentials or malicious network activity. It uses standard logging and configuration access methods. There are no obfuscated patterns or suspicious external calls. All imported modules are legitimate parts of the Azure CLI framework, and no external data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware-like behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical Azure CLI extension loader with a first-run warning feature. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. Its purpose is configuration management and user notification, implemented securely.",
