{
  "purpose": "This code initializes and manages command loading for the Azure IoT CLI extension, including handling installation prompts and event registration.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from ctx.config, imports modules, and registers event handlers.",
  "sinks": "Logs warnings using get_logger, sets configuration values via ctx.config.set_value.",
  "flows": "Configuration data read -> event handler triggered -> warning logged and config value set.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Uses standard Azure CLI extension mechanisms. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages extension setup, including a handler that warns users about IoT extension installation and sets a configuration flag. It imports necessary modules, registers event handlers, and loads command tables and arguments in a standard manner. There are no external data inputs or outputs that could be exploited maliciously. The use of logging and config setting is typical and not suspicious. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks were identified.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard extension loader code for Azure CLI with no malicious intent or security issues. It performs expected setup tasks without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
