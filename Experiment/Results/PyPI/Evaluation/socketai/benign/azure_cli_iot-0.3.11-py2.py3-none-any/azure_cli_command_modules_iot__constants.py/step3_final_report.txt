  "purpose": "This code provides static documentation and configuration data, including a help message URL and a hardcoded Azure AD application ID, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string variables: 'certificate_help' and 'CLIENT_ID'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data flows; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely static.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded 'CLIENT_ID' which could be sensitive if exposed; no obfuscation or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static strings with no functions or dynamic behavior. The 'CLIENT_ID' is a fixed string, typical in configuration files, but could be sensitive if the code is shared publicly. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The static help message is benign. The main concern is the exposure of the 'CLIENT_ID', which is likely a public identifier but could be sensitive if misused. The overall structure is straightforward and free of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing static documentation and configuration data. The only potential security concern is the hardcoded 'CLIENT_ID', which should be managed securely if it is sensitive. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal but noteworthy exposure of a static credential.",
