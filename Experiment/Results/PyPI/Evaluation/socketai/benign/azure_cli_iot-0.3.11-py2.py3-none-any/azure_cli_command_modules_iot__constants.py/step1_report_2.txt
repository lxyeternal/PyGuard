  "purpose": "Provides a help message about CA certificates and stores an Azure AD application ID",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string in 'certificate_help' and hardcoded CLIENT_ID",
  "sinks": "The hardcoded CLIENT_ID could potentially be used in authentication flows, but here it's static data",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static strings are assigned to variables",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded application ID and a help message; no unusual or suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code includes a static help message string and a hardcoded Azure AD client ID, which are typical in configuration files or documentation. There are no indications of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code does not perform any operations, network activity, or user input processing. All data is static and for informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration snippet containing static documentation and a credential identifier. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
