  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code snippets are static, containing only documentation strings and hardcoded identifiers.\n- No dynamic data, input/output handling, or network activity.\n- The main concern is the hardcoded CLIENT_ID, which is a public identifier for an Azure AD application. While not inherently malicious, hardcoded credentials can pose security risks if leaked or misused.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Help info + hardcoded CLIENT_ID.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** No malicious activity, benign static data.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.2) seems appropriate given the static nature. Malware score is correctly 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, focusing on help message and CLIENT_ID.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the benign nature. Slightly lower risk score, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- Emphasizes the potential sensitivity of the hardcoded CLIENT_ID.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3, confidence=0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk due to the credential being potentially sensitive. The score seems justified; no malware or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- Similar to previous, noting the static help string and CLIENT_ID.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- Again, static help message + CLIENT_ID.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Conclusions:**\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0 across all reports; no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0; no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, with some reports assigning a slightly higher risk (0.3) due to the hardcoded CLIENT_ID, which is justified as it could be sensitive information.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations & Final Assessment:**\n- The scores are consistent with the code's benign static nature.\n- The main concern is the hardcoded CLIENT_ID, which could be sensitive if exposed, but in this context, it appears to be a public identifier.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (a slight concern over hardcoded credentials, but overall low risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate and well-justified. The code is benign, with the only potential concern being the hardcoded CLIENT_ID, which is common in configuration snippets but should be managed securely in production environments.",
