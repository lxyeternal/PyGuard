  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing static documentation and configuration data. The only potential security concern is the hardcoded 'CLIENT_ID', which should be managed securely if it is sensitive. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal but noteworthy exposure of a static credential."
