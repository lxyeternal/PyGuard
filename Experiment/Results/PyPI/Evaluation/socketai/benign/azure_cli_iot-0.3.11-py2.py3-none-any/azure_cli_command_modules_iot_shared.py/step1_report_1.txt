{
  "purpose": "Define shared data types (enums) for routing endpoints, route sources, encoding formats, user roles, and key renewal types in a system, likely related to Azure IoT or messaging services.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading sources; the code solely defines enumerations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; the code does not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from source to sink; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains standard enum definitions with no suspicious constructs or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of enum class definitions, each representing fixed string values for different categories used in a system. It includes standard docstrings and license comments. No user input, data processing, or external interactions are present. There are no hardcoded secrets, no malicious code, and no unusual language features. The code is straightforward, and the enum values are static strings related to configuration or role definitions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign set of enumeration definitions for system configuration purposes. It does not contain any malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
