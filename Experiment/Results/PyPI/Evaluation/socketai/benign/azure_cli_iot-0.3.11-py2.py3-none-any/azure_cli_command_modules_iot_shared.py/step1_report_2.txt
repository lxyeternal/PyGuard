  "purpose": "Define shared data types and enums for routing and user roles within a system.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions and their string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines enums without dynamic data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions that specify various constants used for system configuration, such as endpoint types, route source types, encoding formats, user roles, and key renewal types. All enum values are static strings, and there are no dynamic or external data inputs, no code execution, and no potential for malicious behavior. The code appears to be a standard, benign module defining constants for use elsewhere in the application.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward and safe enumeration definitions module with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
