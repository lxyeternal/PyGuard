  "purpose": "Define shared data types (enums) related to routing endpoints, route sources, encoding formats, user roles, and key renewal types.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources; code defines enum classes only.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not handle external input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow between sources and sinks; the code only declares enums without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code contains standard enum definitions with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions that categorize different types related to messaging endpoints, route sources, encoding formats, user roles, and key renewal types. There are no functions, input handling, or external interactions. The content is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or hidden code. No suspicious data flows or anomalies are present. The code appears to be part of a larger codebase for configuration or type safety, and it does not perform any operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as type definitions for various categories within a larger application. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
