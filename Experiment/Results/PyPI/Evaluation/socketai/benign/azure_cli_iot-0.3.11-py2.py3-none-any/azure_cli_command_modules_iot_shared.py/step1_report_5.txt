  "purpose": "Define shared data types (enums) related to routing, source types, encoding formats, user roles, and key renewal types for a larger system.",
  "sources": "Importing the enum module, defining enum classes with string values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed. The enum classes are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of enum class definitions used for configuration or categorization purposes within a larger application. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted data, and no embedded secrets or backdoors. All classes are straightforward and serve as constants. The code appears to be standard, maintainable, and intended solely for defining types.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a set of enum definitions used for categorization within a system, with no active or potentially harmful operations.",
