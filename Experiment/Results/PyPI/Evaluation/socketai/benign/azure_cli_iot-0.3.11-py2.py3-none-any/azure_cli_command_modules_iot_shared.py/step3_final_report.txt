  "purpose": "Define shared data types (enums) for endpoint types, route sources, encoding formats, user roles, and key renewal types used in a larger system.",
  "sources": "Static enum class definitions with fixed string values, no external data inputs or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward enum classes with no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions with static string values, serving as configuration constants. There are no functions, data processing, external data handling, or dynamic behaviors. All reports agree that the code is benign, with high confidence, and assign scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present. The code is standard, well-documented, and purely declarative, indicating no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, non-malicious, and poses no security threat. The scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, configuration-only nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
