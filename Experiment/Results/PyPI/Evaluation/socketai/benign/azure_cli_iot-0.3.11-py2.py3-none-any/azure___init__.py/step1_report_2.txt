  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package, likely part of a larger package or SDK.",
  "sources": "The __name__ variable used in declare_namespace, which refers to the current module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pkg_resources.declare_namespace(__name__) is an older pattern for namespace packages, but not inherently malicious. No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares the current module as a namespace package. This is a common pattern in Python to allow multiple distributions to share the same namespace. No user input, network activity, or potentially malicious constructs are present. The code is minimal and follows standard practices for namespace packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign operation related to namespace declaration for package management. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
