  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "Import statement for pkg_resources and namespace declaration",
  "sinks": "None present",
  "flows": "None, as the code only declares a namespace",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors observed; the code is minimal and standard for namespace declaration",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and declares a namespace for the current package using 'declare_namespace(__name__)'. This is a common practice in namespace packages, especially in large or modular Python projects. No data input, output, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform any network operations, file operations, or data processing that could be malicious. It simply sets up a namespace.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
