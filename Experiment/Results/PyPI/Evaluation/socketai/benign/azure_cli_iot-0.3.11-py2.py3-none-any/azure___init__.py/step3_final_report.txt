  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved",
  "flows": "Import of pkg_resources -> declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward namespace declaration, no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares the current module as a namespace package, a common pattern in Python packaging. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, or network activity. The code is simple, readable, and adheres to standard practices. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. The analysis confirms it is benign, and the scores are justified. No further action is necessary.",
