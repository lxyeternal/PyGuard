  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, allowing multiple distribution packages to share a common namespace.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's name (__name__) during runtime.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "The namespace declaration uses the module name as input, but it does not lead to further data flow or actions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, using standard namespace declaration with no additional logic, secrets, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward namespace declaration using pkg_resources, which is a common pattern for Python packages that want to share namespace. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code. The code does not perform any external operations, data leaks, or contain obfuscated parts. It is standard package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security risks.",
