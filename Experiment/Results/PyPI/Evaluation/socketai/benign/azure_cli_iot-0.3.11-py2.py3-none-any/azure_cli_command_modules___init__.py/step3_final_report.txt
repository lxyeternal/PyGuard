  "purpose": "Set up a namespace package in Python using pkg_resources' declare_namespace method.",
  "sources": "Importing pkg_resources module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process data or perform I/O.",
  "flows": "Import of pkg_resources → call to declare_namespace(__name__) with no data flow beyond namespace declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, straightforward, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkg_resources module and declares a namespace with declare_namespace(__name__). It does not handle any data input, output, or network activity. The code is a common pattern for Python namespace packages, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code. The high confidence score (1.0) is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign namespace declaration for Python packages. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. All reports correctly assess the code as safe, with appropriate scoring. No improvements or changes are necessary.",
