  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, typically used for modular organization of package components.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read; only the package's own namespace declaration.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists, as the code only declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pkg_resources.declare_namespace is sometimes associated with legacy namespace packages; however, this alone is not suspicious. The code does not include any hidden or unusual behavior, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace, which is standard practice for Python packages utilizing namespace packages. There is no evidence of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The file is minimal and serves a straightforward purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard namespace declaration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
