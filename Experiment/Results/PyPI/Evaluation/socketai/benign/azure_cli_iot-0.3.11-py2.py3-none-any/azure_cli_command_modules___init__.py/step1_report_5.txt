  "purpose": "Declare a namespace for a Python package, enabling it to be part of a namespace package.",
  "sources": "Importing 'pkg_resources' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or input sources present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code only declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'declare_namespace' is a standard pattern for namespace packages, no anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace with '__name__'. This is a common practice in Python packaging for namespace packages, typically to allow multiple distributions to contribute to the same namespace. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The code is minimal, straightforward, and adheres to standard conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and serves only to declare a namespace for packaging purposes. It poses no security threat or malicious intent.",
