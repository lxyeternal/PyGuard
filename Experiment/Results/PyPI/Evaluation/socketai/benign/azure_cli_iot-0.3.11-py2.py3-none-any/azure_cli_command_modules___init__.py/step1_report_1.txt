  "purpose": "Declare namespace for a Python package to enable namespace packages, allowing multiple distributions to share the same namespace.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'pkg_resources' to manage package resources and declare namespace.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "The import of 'pkg_resources' and declaration of namespace are isolated and do not involve untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'pkg_resources.declare_namespace' indicates namespace package setup; no unusual code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' library and declares the current package as a namespace package. This is a common practice for Python packages that are split across multiple distributions. The code is straightforward, with no signs of data leakage, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. It does not contain any input handling, untrusted data sources, or sinks. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely sets up a namespace package and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, safe setup code for Python package namespace management.",
