  "purpose": "Declare namespace for the package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "import pkg_resources, call to declare_namespace",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leakage or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as code only declares namespace",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; usage of declare_namespace is standard for namespace packages, no suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace, which is a common pattern in Python packages to support namespace packages. No input reading, no data transmission, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious behavior observed. The code is minimal and adheres to standard practices without any obfuscated or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of namespace declaration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
