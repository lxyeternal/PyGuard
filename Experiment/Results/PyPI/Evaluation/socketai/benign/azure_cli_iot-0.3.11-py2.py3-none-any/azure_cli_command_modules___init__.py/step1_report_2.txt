{
  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package for a Python project, typically used to allow multiple distribution packages to share a common namespace.",
  "sources": "Importing 'pkg_resources' and calling 'declare_namespace' with the current module name.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no data leaks or malicious effects triggered by this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow between sources and sinks; the code only declares a namespace without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'declare_namespace' suggests legacy namespace packaging; no other anomalies or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, only importing 'pkg_resources' and declaring the namespace. This is a standard pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or unusual behavior. The code's purpose is solely to facilitate namespace sharing across multiple packages. It does not perform any network activity, data processing, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign declaration for a namespace package. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code's purpose is purely structural, enabling namespace sharing in Python packages.",
