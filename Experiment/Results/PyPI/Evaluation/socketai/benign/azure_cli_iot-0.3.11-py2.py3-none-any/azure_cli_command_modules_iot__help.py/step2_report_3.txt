  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe the code as static help documentation for Azure IoT CLI commands.\n- No executable logic, data processing, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are identified.\n- The command examples include resource IDs, connection strings, and file paths, but these are standard illustrative examples, not actual secrets.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment of Security Risks:**\n- Since the code is purely static help text, the risk of supply chain attack or malicious behavior is extremely low.\n- The presence of connection strings and resource IDs in examples is typical and not inherently dangerous, provided they are just illustrative.\n\n**Scores Justification:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all reports. No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are observed.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.5 or lower, given the static nature and benign content. The highest is 0.5, but even that is borderline; most reports assign 0.\n\n**Potential Concerns:**\n- The only minor concern is that example commands include strings that resemble secrets (connection strings, resource IDs). However, these are standard examples and do not pose a real security risk unless misused.\n\n**Consistency Check:**\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies are evident.\n\n**Final Expert Estimation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, just for completeness)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is entirely static help documentation with no executable or malicious content.\n- No security risks or supply chain issues are present.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, just due to the presence of example strings that look like secrets but are harmless in context)\n\nThis thorough review confirms the code's benign nature and absence of security threats.",
