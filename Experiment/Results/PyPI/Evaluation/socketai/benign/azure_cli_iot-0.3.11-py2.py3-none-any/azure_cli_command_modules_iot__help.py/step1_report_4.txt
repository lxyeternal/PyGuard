  "purpose": "This code defines help documentation strings for Azure CLI commands related to IoT management, including IoT hubs, device provisioning services, digital twin repositories, certificates, routes, policies, and other IoT-related functionalities.",
  "sources": "Help string definitions assigned to the 'helps' dictionary for various command groups and commands.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; the code does not process user input or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely contains static documentation strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. All strings are descriptive help texts for CLI commands. No dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no network activity or data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of static help documentation for Azure IoT CLI commands, with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. The presence of license comments and well-structured help strings indicates standard documentation practice. No potential security risks or malicious intent are observed within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely static help documentation for Azure IoT CLI commands, with no malicious code or security risks. It contains no executable logic, network activity, or data handling that could be exploited for malicious purposes.",
