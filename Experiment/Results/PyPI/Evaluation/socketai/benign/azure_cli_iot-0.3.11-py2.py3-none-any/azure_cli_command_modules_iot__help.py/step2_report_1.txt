  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on potential security implications, correctness, and consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clarifies that the code is static help documentation for Azure IoT CLI commands. No data processing, input handling, or external data sources involved.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Confirms that the code is purely static help text with no executable logic, no secrets, no malicious code, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Malware & Risk Score:** Both are 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high certainty).\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. No issues detected. The code is benign documentation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, static help strings for CLI commands, including resource identifiers and connection strings in examples.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No executable code, no data flow, no secrets embedded in actual logic—only example strings. The mention of connection strings and resource IDs is standard for help documentation.\n- **Potential Concern:** The inclusion of strings resembling secrets (connection strings, resource IDs) in examples could be misused if copied, but these are only illustrative, not actual secrets.\n- **Malware & Risk Score:** Both 0, which is correct.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is correct. No malicious code, just help text with example parameters.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static help documentation for CLI commands.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic code, no input handling, no secrets, no obfuscation. The content is standard help documentation.\n- **Potential concern:** The presence of example strings with resource IDs or connection strings is typical and not malicious.\n- **Malware & Risk Score:** Both 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully aligned with the nature of the code. No security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Help strings for CLI commands related to Azure IoT services.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No executable logic, data flow, or dynamic content. No secrets or malicious behavior. The help strings are standard and static.\n- **Potential concern:** The command examples include resource IDs and connection strings, but these are purely illustrative.\n- **Malware & Risk Score:** Both 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly identified as benign static documentation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Help documentation strings for Azure IoT CLI commands.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No dynamic code, no data processing, no secrets, no obfuscation. The content is static help text.\n- **Potential concern:** Same as above, example strings could be misused if copied, but they are only illustrative.\n- **Malware & Risk Score:** Both 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Code Content:** Entirely static help documentation for Azure IoT CLI commands.\n- **Executable Logic & Data Handling:** None.\n- **Secrets & Secrets Exposure:** None embedded; only example strings which are standard.\n- **Malicious Behavior & Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Supply Chain Security Risks:** None evident; no external dependencies or dynamic code.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (benign static help text)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\nThe reports are consistent with the actual code content. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is purely static help documentation for Azure IoT CLI commands, with no executable code, data processing, or secrets. It poses no security risk, malware, or obfuscation concerns.",
