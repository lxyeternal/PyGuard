{
  "purpose": "The code provides static help documentation strings for Azure IoT CLI commands, with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Help string definitions assigned to the 'helps' dictionary, including command descriptions and example parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process input or output data, nor does it execute commands or handle secrets.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow exists; the code only assigns static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. Example strings include resource IDs and connection strings, but these are standard placeholders.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static help documentation for Azure IoT CLI commands. It contains no executable code, no dynamic data processing, and no embedded secrets. The presence of resource identifiers and connection strings in examples is typical and not malicious. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The help strings are standard and static, posing no security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static documentation with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the content.",
