  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard resource management via CLI, importing modules and functions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of untrusted data manipulation; straightforward invocation of Azure SDK clients.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The try-except workaround for 404 errors during deletion is a documented API workaround, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical Azure CLI extension setup, with no malicious indicators. It primarily registers commands and handles long-running operations securely.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0. \n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining CLI commands for IoT resources.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evident untrusted data handling or malicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** Standard patterns; error handling for 404 during deletion is a known API quirk.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate CLI setup, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2 (slightly elevated but justified due to error handling).\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable; no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** CLI command registration, similar pattern.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows or external calls.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or secrets; error handling is standard.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard resource management CLI code, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** CLI command registration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of transform classes for long-running operations; error handling is documented.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical Azure CLI extension code, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar CLI command registration.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows.\n- **Anomalies:** Standard patterns; no obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Well-structured, legitimate resource management code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Security Risk: 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity. The code is standard CLI extension code for resource management.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected across all reports.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1-0.2, justified by error handling and API workarounds.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.1** — Slightly elevated due to error handling, but overall very low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, legitimate Azure CLI extension module for managing IoT resources. No malicious intent, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are evident from the provided code and reports.",
