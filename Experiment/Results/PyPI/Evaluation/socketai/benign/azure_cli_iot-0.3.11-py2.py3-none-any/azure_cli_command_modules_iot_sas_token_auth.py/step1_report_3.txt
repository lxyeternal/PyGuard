{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class for generating Azure IoT Hub Shared Access Signature (SAS) tokens for authentication purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from parameters such as 'uri', 'shared_access_policy_name', 'shared_access_key', and 'expiry'. Uses time() for current time, and functions like quote() and b64decode().",
  "sinks": "Generates a SAS token string with 'sr', 'sig', 'se', and 'skn' parameters; potentially used in HTTP headers for authentication.",
  "flows": "Inputs (uri, key, expiry) are used to generate a signature which is included in the SAS token, then used in requests for Azure IoT Hub.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets; use of standard cryptographic functions. No suspicious network activity or backdoors detected. The code adheres to intended security protocols for token generation.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly implements SAS token generation following Azure standards. It securely encodes inputs, hashes with HMAC SHA-256, and encodes the signature in base64. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The use of standard libraries and cryptographic functions indicates normal operation. No signs of backdoors, data leaks, or malicious logic. The code is structured for its purpose and does not contain obfuscation or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of Azure IoT Hub SAS token generation with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. It appears legitimate and secure for its purpose.",
