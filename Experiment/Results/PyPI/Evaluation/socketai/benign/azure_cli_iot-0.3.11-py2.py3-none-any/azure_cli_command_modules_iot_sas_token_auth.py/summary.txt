  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of Azure IoT Hub SAS token creation. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate. The minor technical note regarding signature decoding is not a security concern but should be addressed for correctness. Overall, the code is safe, transparent, and aligns with best practices."
