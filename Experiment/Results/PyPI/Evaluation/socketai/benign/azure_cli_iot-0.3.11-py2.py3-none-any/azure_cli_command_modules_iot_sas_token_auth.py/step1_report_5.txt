  "purpose": "Implement Azure IoT Hub Shared Access Signature (SAS) token authentication for secure access.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters: uri, shared_access_policy_name, shared_access_key, expiry; also reads time from time().",
  "sinks": "Generates SAS token string with signature, potentially used in HTTP Authorization headers.",
  "flows": "Inputs (uri, key, expiry) are used to generate a signature via HMAC, which is then embedded in a token for authorization headers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URLs, or malicious code detected. Proper use of cryptography libraries. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code securely generates a SAS token using standard cryptographic practices. It takes inputs such as URI, shared access key, and expiry time, then creates a signed token for authentication. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage. The code only performs token generation for Azure IoT services. No external network connections or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of Azure IoT SAS token authentication. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard cryptographic procedures and does not reveal sensitive information or perform suspicious actions.",
