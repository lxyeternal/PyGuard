  "purpose": "Implement shared access signature (SAS) token generation for Azure IoT Hub authentication.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: uri, shared_access_policy_name, shared_access_key, expiry.",
  "sinks": "generate_sas_token() creates a signed token that is used in HTTP headers for authentication.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> generate_sas_token() -> creates a signature -> encodes and constructs the SAS token string.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. Uses standard cryptographic methods and libraries. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for generating SAS tokens for Azure IoT Hub. It correctly encodes the URI, calculates an HMAC SHA-256 signature, and encodes it in base64. The expiry time defaults to one hour if not provided. No obfuscated code, no unusual control flow, and it adheres to standard practices for token creation. The use of existing libraries and straightforward logic indicates no malicious intent. No data leakage, backdoors, or malicious side effects are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of SAS token generation for Azure IoT authentication. It follows best practices and does not show signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise.",
