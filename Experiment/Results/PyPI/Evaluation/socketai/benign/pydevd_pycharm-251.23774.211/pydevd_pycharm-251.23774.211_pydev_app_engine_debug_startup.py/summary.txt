  "conclusion": "The code is intended for debugging and is not malicious by itself. However, its ability to connect to external debuggers with unvalidated data poses a moderate security risk if exposed or misused. The 'if False:' block reduces immediate risk but does not eliminate the underlying vulnerability. Proper safeguards, such as disabling in production and validating inputs, are recommended."
