  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate. The minimal security risk score (~0.1) reflects the standard placeholder replacement process, which could be exploited if source files are compromised, but this is a common and controlled practice in build systems."
