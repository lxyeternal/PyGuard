  "purpose": "Build and distribute the pydevd debugger package, managing versioning, data collection, and setup configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'VERSION' file; reads and modifies 'pydevd_comm.py'; collects data files based on extensions; loads README.md.",
  "sinks": "Writes updated 'pydevd_comm.py'; executes setup() to install package; potentially modifies source files with version info.",
  "flows": "Version info read from file -> placeholder replacement in source files -> setup() invocation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of version placeholder replacement; no suspicious code, network activity, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: reading version info, updating source files with version placeholders, collecting data files, and executing setup(). No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation present. The placeholder replacement is a common practice in build scripts and does not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and aligns with typical packaging workflows.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are appropriate. The minimal security risk score (~0.1) reflects the standard placeholder replacement process, which could be exploited if source files are compromised, but this is a common and controlled practice in build systems.",
