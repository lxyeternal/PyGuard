  "purpose": "Setup script for distributing the pydevd debugger package via PyPI, facilitating remote debugging for users.",
  "sources": "Reads version from 'VERSION' file; reads 'README.md' for long description; accesses files in 'pydevd_attach_to_process', '_pydevd_bundle', '_pydevd_frame_eval' directories; reads and writes to 'pydevd_comm.py'.",
  "sinks": "Modifies 'pydevd_comm.py' to replace version placeholders; reads files for package data; executes 'setup()' function which installs package files and compiles extensions.",
  "flows": "Reads version from file -> replaces placeholders in 'pydevd_comm.py' -> reads package data files -> runs 'setup()' which installs files and compiles extensions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code performs standard setup operations. Dynamic code execution or obfuscation is not present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads version info from a file and updates placeholders in 'pydevd_comm.py'. It gathers package data from specific directories and extensions, then runs 'setuptools.setup' to install the package, including optional compilation of Cython extensions. The code is straightforward, with no unusual behaviors or hidden code. It adheres to standard Python packaging practices without suspicious or malicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. It performs legitimate package installation and optional extension compilation without any malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
