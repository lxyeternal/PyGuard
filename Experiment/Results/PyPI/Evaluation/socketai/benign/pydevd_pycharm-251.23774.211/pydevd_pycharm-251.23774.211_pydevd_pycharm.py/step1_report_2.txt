{
  "purpose": "Expose `settrace` and `stoptrace` functions from `pydevd` for debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports `settrace` and `stoptrace` from `pydevd`, reads `VERSION_STRING` from `_pydevd_bundle.pydevd_comm`.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions.",
  "flows": "Imports lead to the assignment of functions and version string, with no further data flow or execution beyond exports.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily re-exports debugging functions from a debugging library (`pydevd`) and includes a version string. It does not perform any operations beyond imports and exports. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The imported functions are intended for debugging and are commonly used during development, not inherently malicious. The code structure is straightforward and clean with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple re-export of debugging functions for development purposes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
