  "purpose": "Expose debugging functions `settrace` and `stoptrace` from `pydevd`, and the version string, for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from `pydevd` and `_pydevd_bundle.pydevd_comm` modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; only re-exports functions and version info.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely import and export of debugging utilities.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports debugging functions and version info, then exposes them via `__all__`. It contains no data processing, user input, or malicious code. The functions are standard debugging utilities, which are powerful but not inherently malicious. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk between 0.1 and 0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, acknowledging that exposing debugging functions can pose risks if misused, but the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, benign module exposing debugging functions with no malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score reflecting potential misuse. No modifications are necessary.",
