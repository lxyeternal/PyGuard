  "sources": "Importing functions settrace and stoptrace from pydevd, reading VERSION_STRING from _pydevd_bundle.pydevd_comm",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Importing debugging functions and version info, then exposing them via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export of debugging functions and version string",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports debugging functions and a version string from well-known debugging modules, then exposes them. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of debugging functions is typical for development environments and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely imports and exposes debugging functions and version info, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It is a standard setup for debugging purposes.",
