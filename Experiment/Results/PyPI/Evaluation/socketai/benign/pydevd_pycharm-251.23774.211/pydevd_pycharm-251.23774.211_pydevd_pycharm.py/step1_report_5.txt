  "purpose": "Expose pydevd debugging functions for use in other modules or scripts.",
  "sources": "Importing 'settrace' and 'stoptrace' from 'pydevd', which are debugging functions that can potentially control debugging sessions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; only importing and re-exporting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscated elements, or hidden behaviors detected. The code only exposes debugging functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports debugging functions from a well-known debugger library (pydevd) used in IDE debugging scenarios. It then makes these functions available for external use. The code also retrieves version information from the '_pydevd_bundle.pydevd_comm' module. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. Since 'settrace' and 'stoptrace' are standard debugging functions, their presence alone is not malicious but should be used cautiously in production environments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module that exposes debugging functions from the pydevd library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks on its own. However, the functions it exposes could be misused if incorporated into malicious workflows, but the code itself is benign.",
