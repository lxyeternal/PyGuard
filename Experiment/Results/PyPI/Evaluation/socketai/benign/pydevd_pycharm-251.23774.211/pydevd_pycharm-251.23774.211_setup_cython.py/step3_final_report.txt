  "purpose": "Build script for compiling Cython extensions for the pydevd debugger, managing source files, and handling version-specific configurations.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, filesystem operations (copying, deleting files), source code files (.pyx, .pxd, .c), environment variables for Python version and architecture.",
  "sinks": "setup() function invoking compilation, file operations (shutil.copy, os.remove) based on user input, creating __init__.py files.",
  "flows": "Command-line args influence file copying and deletion; source files are copied/renamed based on target names; build() compiles extensions; cleanup removes temporary files.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns; no validation or sanitization of command-line inputs; standard build operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical build automation script for Cython extensions, involving file copying, renaming, compilation, and cleanup. It uses standard libraries and build tools without any network activity or malicious payloads. The use of command-line arguments to manipulate files could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but this is common in build scripts and not inherently malicious. No obfuscation or backdoors are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2 are consistent with the code's purpose and operations.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build utility for Cython extensions with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects minimal inherent risk due to filesystem operations based on user input, which is typical for build scripts. The scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.",
