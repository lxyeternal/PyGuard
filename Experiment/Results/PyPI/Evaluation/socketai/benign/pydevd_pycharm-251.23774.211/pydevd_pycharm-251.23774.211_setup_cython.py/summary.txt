  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build utility for Cython extensions with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score reflects minimal inherent risk due to filesystem operations based on user input, which is typical for build scripts. The scores are appropriate and should remain as-is."
