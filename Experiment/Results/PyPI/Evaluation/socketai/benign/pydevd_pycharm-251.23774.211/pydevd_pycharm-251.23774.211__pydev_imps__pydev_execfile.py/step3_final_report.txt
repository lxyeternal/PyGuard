  "purpose": "Define a Python 2-style execfile() function for Python 3 that reads and executes external scripts safely.",
  "sources": "File input via tokenize.open(), reading file contents.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing the file contents in given global and local contexts.",
  "flows": "File read -> compile -> exec in provided namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard utility pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines execfile() for Python 3, reading a file with tokenize.open(), then compiling and executing its contents. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of exec() on external files is inherently risky if files are untrusted, but this is a known pattern for compatibility, not malicious intent. The code is straightforward and clear, with no obfuscation. The security risk stems from executing external code, but this is inherent to the function's purpose, not a flaw. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, reflecting the potential danger of executing untrusted files but not indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for backward compatibility, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The main security concern is executing external files, which is inherent to its purpose, not a security flaw. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
