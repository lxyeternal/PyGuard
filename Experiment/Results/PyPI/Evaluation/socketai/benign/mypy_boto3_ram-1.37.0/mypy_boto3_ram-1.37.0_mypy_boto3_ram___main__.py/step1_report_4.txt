{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entrypoint to display package information and version details for a Python package related to boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, specifically checking for '--version'.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to stdout using sys.stdout.write.",
  "flows": "Input (sys.argv) → Conditional check → Output (stdout)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, provides two functions to print package info and version, and a main function that responds to '--version' argument or defaults to printing info. The code performs straightforward string output operations with no data processing, no user input beyond command-line args, and no external network calls or file operations. The logic is simple and typical for CLI entrypoints. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI utility that outputs package information and version data. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign part of a package's documentation or informational CLI tool.",
