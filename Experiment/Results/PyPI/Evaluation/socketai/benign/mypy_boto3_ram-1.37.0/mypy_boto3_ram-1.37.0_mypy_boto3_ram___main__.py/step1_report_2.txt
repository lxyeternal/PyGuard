  "purpose": "Provide CLI information about a package, including its version and documentation links.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (for command-line arguments), sys.stdout (for printing output)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout (output), sys.argv (reading command-line input)",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--version' from sys.argv triggers print_version output to sys.stdout",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI tool that outputs package info or version. It reads command-line arguments via sys.argv, and writes output via sys.stdout. No untrusted input handling beyond argument checking is present. The printed information is static, with no user data or external data sources accessed. No suspicious or malicious activity detected. The code structure is straightforward, and no anomalies or malicious indicators are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign CLI utility intended for informational purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or malicious code patterns in this code.",
