{
  "purpose": "The script serves as a command-line interface (CLI) entry point to provide package information and version details for a specific Python package related to boto3 stubs.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) and writes output to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data using sys.stdout.write, which could be manipulated if sys.argv were controlled by an attacker.",
  "flows": "User supplies command-line argument '--version', which triggers print_version(); otherwise, print_info() is called. Data flows from sys.argv to control logic, and output is sent to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure patterns detected. The code is straightforward, mainly printing static info.",
  "analysis": "The code reads command-line input to determine whether to display version information or package details. It outputs static, non-sensitive information and does not process untrusted data beyond argument checking. No external network connections, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. The code's simplicity reduces the likelihood of malicious behavior. No anomalies or malicious indicators are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign CLI utility that provides package information and version details. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. It appears to be a straightforward informational script with no malicious intent.",
