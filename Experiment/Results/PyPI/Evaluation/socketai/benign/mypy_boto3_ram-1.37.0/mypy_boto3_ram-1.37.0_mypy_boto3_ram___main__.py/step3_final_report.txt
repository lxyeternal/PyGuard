  "purpose": "Provides static package information and version details via CLI.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`), specifically checking for '--version'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to `sys.stdout`.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument (`--version`) triggers `print_version()`, otherwise `print_info()` outputs static info.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple CLI utility that outputs static package info or version. It reads arguments and writes to stdout without external data, network calls, or dynamic execution. No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The logic is clear and standard, with no suspicious constructs. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward CLI utility with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
