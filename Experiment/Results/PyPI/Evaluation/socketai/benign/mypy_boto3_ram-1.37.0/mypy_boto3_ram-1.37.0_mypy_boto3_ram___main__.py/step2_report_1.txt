  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code is a simple CLI script that outputs static package info or version.\n   - It reads command-line arguments via `sys.argv`.\n   - It writes output to `sys.stdout`.\n   - No external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious constructs.\n   \n   **Conclusion**: The code is benign and functions as an informational CLI utility.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Logic and Reasoning**:\n   - All reports consistently describe the code as straightforward, with no suspicious patterns.\n   - They note the absence of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious behavior.\n   - The analysis in each report aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   - No discrepancies or logical flaws are evident in the reports.\n   \n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 or 0.0\n     - `malware`: 0 or 0.0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 or 0.0\n     - `confidence`: 1 or 1.0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - The high confidence scores are justified.\n   \n4. **Malware and Risk Justification**:\n   - Since no malicious activity is detected, malware score remains at 0.\n   - Security risk is also zero, as the code doesn't perform any risky operations.\n   - The reports' assessments are consistent with the code's behavior.\n   \n5. **Potential Assumptions or Claims**:\n   - All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the code's simplicity.\n   - No claims about vulnerabilities are made beyond the code's scope.\n   \n6. **Overall Consistency and Additional Insights**:\n   - The scores across reports are consistent.\n   - The code is clearly a benign CLI utility with no malicious intent.\n   \n7. **My Final Estimation**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0.0 — code is straightforward and readable.\n   - **Risk score**: 0.0 — no security risks identified.\n   \n   These align with the reports' assessments.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is a simple, benign CLI script.\n- All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The scoring is appropriate and consistent.\n- No modifications needed; the overall security posture is clear and safe.\n\n**Final recommendation**:\n- Keep the scores at 0.0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n- Confirm that the code remains simple and free of hidden malicious logic in future versions.\n\n**Note**: Always ensure that future updates do not introduce obfuscation or malicious code, but as of now, this code is safe.",
