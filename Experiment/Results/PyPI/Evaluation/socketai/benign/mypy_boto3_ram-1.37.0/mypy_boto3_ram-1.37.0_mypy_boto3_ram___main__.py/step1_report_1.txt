  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv) to determine output; reads from sys.stdout to display information.",
  "sinks": "Writes to sys.stdout for output; no other data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Checks for '--version' in command-line arguments and then calls print_version(); otherwise calls print_info() which outputs package details.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script functions as a simple CLI tool that outputs package information or version based on command-line input. It uses standard Python modules and straightforward logic. No external data sources, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI utility that provides package metadata. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
