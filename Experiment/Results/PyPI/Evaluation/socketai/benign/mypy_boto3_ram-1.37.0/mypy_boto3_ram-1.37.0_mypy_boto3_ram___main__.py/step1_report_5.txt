  "purpose": "Provides CLI interface to display package information and version details.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Writes output to stdout (sys.stdout.write).",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check -> print_version or print_info -> stdout output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code solely prints static package info and version.",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys, defines functions to print static package info and version, and checks for '--version' argument to determine which info to display. No user input handling beyond command-line args, no external data fetching, no network operations, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be a straightforward CLI utility with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving purely informational purposes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
