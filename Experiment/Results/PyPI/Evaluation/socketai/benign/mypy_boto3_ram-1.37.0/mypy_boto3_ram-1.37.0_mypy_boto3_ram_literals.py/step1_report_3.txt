{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS RAM-related constants to facilitate type annotations and validation in Python code.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of string literals to variables; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions; the code is purely defining constants and types.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations or output; the code solely defines type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a copyright statement claiming 2025, which is future-dated, indicating possible falsification or placeholder text. No other anomalies or malicious indicators are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type aliases for various AWS-related string literals using Python's typing.Literal. It uses conditional import for compatibility with Python 3.12+ versus earlier versions. No dynamic execution, external input handling, or sensitive data processing is present. The extensive list of literals is static and appears to serve as a reference for type safety in client code. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or malicious data collection mechanisms. The only suspicious aspect is the future-dated copyright year, which might be a placeholder or misconfigured date, but it does not affect security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of type definitions for AWS resource and operation names, with no malicious behavior detected. It is safe and intended for type safety and documentation purposes.",
