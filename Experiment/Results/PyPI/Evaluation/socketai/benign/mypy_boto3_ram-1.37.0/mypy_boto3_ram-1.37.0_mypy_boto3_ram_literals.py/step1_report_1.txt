{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various AWS RAM-related constants and identifiers, providing type safety and documentation references.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and typing_extensions, string literals assigned to variables, and the __all__ list for module exports.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output points; the code primarily declares constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static definitions are isolated.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets beyond literals, obfuscated code, or backdoors. The code is straightforward type declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type aliases for AWS-related string literals, using conditional import for 'Literal' depending on Python version. The literals cover resource names, paginator names, regions, and service names, aligning with documented AWS constants. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data manipulation occurs. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The code's structure and purpose are standard for type safety and documentation.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists solely of static type alias definitions for AWS resource identifiers and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign, standard type declaration module for use with type checkers.",
