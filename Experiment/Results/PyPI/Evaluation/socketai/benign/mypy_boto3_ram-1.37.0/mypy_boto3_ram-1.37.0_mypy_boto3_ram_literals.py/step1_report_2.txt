  "purpose": "Define type annotations using Python's Literal for various AWS resource names, paginator names, regions, and service names to facilitate type checking and code clarity in AWS SDK usage.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and typing; definitions of Literal type annotations for AWS resource identifiers and other constants.",
  "sinks": "None present; the code only defines constants and type aliases without processing untrusted input or executing external commands.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows involving untrusted inputs or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code strictly consists of static type alias definitions and conditional import handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines multiple constants as Literal types for use in type annotations. All definitions are static, straightforward, and documented. There is no dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no external network or filesystem interactions. The purpose appears solely to facilitate type safety in AWS SDK related code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign module providing type aliases for AWS resource identifiers. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements and is designed solely for static type checking purposes. The code is safe and does not pose any security threats.",
