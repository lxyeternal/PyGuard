  "purpose": "Static type alias definitions for AWS RAM constants, resource names, regions, and related identifiers, intended for type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Static string literals assigned to variables; no external input or data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external output involved.",
  "flows": "None; purely static definitions with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Future-dated copyright year (2025), likely a placeholder or typo.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias definitions using Python's Literal, with conditional imports for compatibility. No dynamic code, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The only minor anomaly is the future year, which does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk scores. The code's purpose is purely for type annotations, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is safe, static, and intended for type safety. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The minor anomaly (future year) does not affect security posture.",
