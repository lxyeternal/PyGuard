{
  "purpose": "The code defines type annotations using Python's Literal types for various AWS-related constants and enumerations, facilitating type safety and clarity in AWS SDK usage.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string literals assigned to variables and imports from standard libraries and conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process user input, environment variables, or network data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely establishes type annotations and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code is straightforward and focused on defining literals for type safety. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then defines numerous constants as Literal types representing AWS service names, resource types, regions, and paginator actions. It uses standard Python syntax and type annotation practices without dynamic code execution, external data processing, or side effects. The absence of user input, network operations, or environment variable usage indicates no malicious activity or security risks. The overall structure is clear, well-documented, and purpose-driven for type hinting, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for AWS SDK type annotations, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. It does not perform any operations beyond defining constants and type aliases, thus posing no supply chain security risks.",
