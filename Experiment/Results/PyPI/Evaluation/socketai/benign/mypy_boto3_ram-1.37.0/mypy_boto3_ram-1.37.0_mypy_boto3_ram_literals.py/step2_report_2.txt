  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward static declaration of string literals as type aliases using Python's `Literal`.\n- It includes conditional import handling for Python versions prior to 3.12.\n- The purpose is to facilitate type safety and documentation for AWS resource identifiers, paginator names, regions, and service names.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, network calls, or external inputs.\n- The only notable anomaly is the copyright year \"2025,\" which is future-dated and likely a placeholder or typo.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** The code is a benign set of type aliases for AWS RAM constants, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is purely static type definitions, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the static nature and compatibility handling.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Notes the future-dated copyright year as a minor anomaly.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The future date is suspicious but likely a placeholder. It doesn't impact security. The code remains static and benign.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Reiterates the static nature, no external data, no obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing the purpose and lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Points & Justifications**\n\n- **Code Behavior:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static, with no dynamic execution, external data, or side effects.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- **Potential Risks:** The only minor anomaly is the future year \"2025\" in the copyright statement, which is likely a placeholder.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### **Recommendations**\n\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent.\n- The future-dated copyright year, while suspicious, does not constitute a security risk.\n- No modifications needed to the scoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Assessment**\n\n**Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is straightforward, static, and well-documented.\n\n**Risk Score:** **0** — No security risks present; code is purely for type safety and documentation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a benign, static type declaration module for AWS resource identifiers. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. No further action or concern is warranted.",
