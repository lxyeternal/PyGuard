  "purpose": "Define string literal types for AWS RAM service, pagination, regions, and other identifiers using Python type annotations for better type safety and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys and typing modules; definitions of string Literal types for various AWS-related constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; this is purely type definition code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations for AWS resource and service names, including pagination and regions, using Python's Literal type. It includes a version check for importing Literal from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions'. The data consists solely of static string literals for type safety. No input/output, network operations, or executable logic is present. The code's structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or dynamic code execution. The purpose is purely to facilitate type checking and code documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard type definitions module for AWS RAM service constants, with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any runtime actions or contain sensitive data. The likelihood of malicious behavior is extremely low.",
