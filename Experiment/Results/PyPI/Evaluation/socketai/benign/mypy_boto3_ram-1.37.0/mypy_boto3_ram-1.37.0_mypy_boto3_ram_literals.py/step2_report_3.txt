  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the code, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines string literal types for AWS RAM constants, with documentation references. Sources are static definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external output; purely static.\n- **Anomalies:** Future-dated copyright (2025) noted as suspicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is straightforward type alias definitions, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The future date is likely a placeholder or misconfiguration, not a security concern.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No malicious activity or security issues are evident. The future date is a minor anomaly but not security relevant.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, defining AWS resource name literals with conditional import handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or external interaction.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies besides the standard static definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a benign set of type aliases, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is purely static type definitions, safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines AWS RAM constants, again static literals.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data or processing.\n- **Anomalies:** The only notable point is the future copyright year (2025).\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a typical type alias module, with no malicious behavior. The future date might be placeholder or misconfigured but doesn't impact security.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is correct. The future date is suspicious but not malicious. The overall code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Defines AWS resource and service name literals, with version check for 'Literal'.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; straightforward static definitions.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard type annotation module for AWS constants, with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malicious activity or security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar static definitions for AWS constants, with conditional import.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; the code is purely static.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Safe, standard type alias definitions, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Security Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Confidence = 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports correctly assign 0. The code is static type alias definitions with no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the static nature of the code.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — clear, static definitions.\n- **Risk Score:** **0** — no security risk, no external data handling, no runtime behavior.\n\n**Note:** The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year (2025), which might be placeholder or a typo, but it does not introduce any security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, static set of type alias definitions for AWS resource identifiers, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
