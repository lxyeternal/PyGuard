  "purpose": "Define typed paginator classes for AWS RAM service clients, enabling type-safe pagination in boto3.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore.paginate, and local type_defs module.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no use of untrusted input sources or dangerous data handling.",
  "flows": "Class methods call parent paginate methods, passing unpacked kwargs for pagination, with no external or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code adheres to standard patterns for type-annotated boto3 paginator classes. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type annotations and class definitions for paginators of AWS RAM service. It conditionally imports 'Unpack' for Python >= 3.12, defines base classes with proper type hints, and implements 'paginate' methods with relevant docstrings. No external input handling, network operations, or data leaks are present. The code appears to be straightforward, well-structured, and free from malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of type-safe boto3 paginator classes for the AWS RAM service. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and poses no security threats. It is safe and intended for enhancing code clarity and type safety in pagination.",
