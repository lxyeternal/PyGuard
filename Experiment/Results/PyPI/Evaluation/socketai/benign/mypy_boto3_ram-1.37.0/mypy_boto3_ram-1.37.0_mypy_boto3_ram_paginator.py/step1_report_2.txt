{
  "purpose": "This code defines typed paginator classes for the boto3 RAM client, enabling type-checked pagination in Python.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from imported modules (boto3, sys, typing, custom type definitions) and class method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters are used as input for pagination; no untrusted data is directly processed or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Code flow involves method calls to 'paginate' with kwargs; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code structure is standard for type-annotated boto3 stubs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides typed paginator classes for boto3 RAM service, using conditional typing and type annotations for better IDE support. It employs standard class inheritance and method definitions with no data processing beyond method argument passing. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious logic are detected. The code is purely for type annotations and documentation purposes, with no external or hidden side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured set of type definitions for boto3 RAM paginators. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is meant to facilitate type checking and documentation support for the AWS RAM client pagination.",
