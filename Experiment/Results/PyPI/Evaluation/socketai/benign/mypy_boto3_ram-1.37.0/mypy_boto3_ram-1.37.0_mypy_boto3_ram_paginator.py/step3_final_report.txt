  "purpose": "Type annotations and class definitions for boto3 RAM paginator wrappers to enhance type safety and documentation.",
  "sources": "Method parameters in 'paginate' functions, class inheritance, imported type definitions.",
  "sinks": "No external data sources or sinks; parameters are passed internally to boto3's paginator methods.",
  "flows": "Parameters from method calls flow into boto3's paginator functions via **kwargs, with no external or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of **kwargs in 'paginate' methods, which could accept untrusted input, but this is standard in boto3 and does not lead to malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of typed paginator classes for AWS RAM, utilizing conditional imports for Python version compatibility, with no external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The use of **kwargs is typical for boto3 API wrappers and does not introduce security issues. All class methods and imports serve to provide type safety and documentation. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and intended solely for type safety and documentation support. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is detected. The minimal risk associated with passing **kwargs is justified by the context and does not constitute a security threat.",
