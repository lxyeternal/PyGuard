  "purpose": "Define paginators for AWS RAM service client with type annotations for better static type checking and IDE support.",
  "sources": "Type definitions imported from '.type_defs', sys.version_info for Python version checks, and method parameters via **kwargs.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external outputs detected.",
  "flows": "Paginate methods receive **kwargs with specific type annotations, but do not perform data processing or external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code primarily defines classes and methods with type annotations and documentation links.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type definitions and sets up paginator classes with method annotations. It includes Python version-dependent imports. The class structures inherit from generic Paginator, and the paginate methods are defined with type annotations and docstrings. There are no operations that perform external network calls, data exfiltration, or suspicious code execution. The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured type annotation and class inheritance setup for AWS SDK paginators. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely focused on defining paginator classes with type annotations for AWS RAM SDK. No signs of malicious or maliciously manipulated code are present. It appears to be a legitimate, documentation-focused module without security concerns.",
