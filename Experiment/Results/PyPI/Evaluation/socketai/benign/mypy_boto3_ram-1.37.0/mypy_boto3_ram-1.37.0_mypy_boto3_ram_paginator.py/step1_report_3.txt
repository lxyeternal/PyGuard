  "purpose": "Type annotations and paginator classes for boto3 RAM service client to facilitate paginated API calls with type safety.",
  "sources": "import statements, class method definitions, and type annotations; especially the 'paginate' methods with **kwargs and type unpacking.",
  "sinks": "The 'paginate' methods potentially accept untrusted input via **kwargs which are unpacked into the request types; no direct data leaks or external communications are present in this code.",
  "flows": "User-provided keyword arguments flow from the 'paginate' method calls into the request parameter types, then into the underlying Paginator.paginate method, which returns an iterator over response data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; the code is a straightforward, well-structured type annotation and class hierarchy for boto3 paginators. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of paginator classes for the boto3 RAM client, with precise type annotations and response/request types. It includes conditional imports based on Python version, but nothing that indicates malicious intent. The 'paginate' methods use **kwargs with type unpacking for request parameters, consistent with boto3's pagination pattern. No external network calls, file writes, or data exfiltration code are present. The purpose is solely to provide type-safe paginator wrappers. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of boto3 paginator type annotations. It does not contain any malicious, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. It is safe and intended for use as part of type-checked boto3 SDK stubs.",
