  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a copyright statement and a version string assignment. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, no external data sources, and no suspicious logic. The version string is static. The presence of a copyright notice does not indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal and standard for a version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version declaration with no malicious or security risks detected. It is a typical pattern for maintaining package version information.",
