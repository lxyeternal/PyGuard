  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple static assignment of a version string to `__version__`, accompanied by a copyright comment.  \n   **Conclusion**: No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the absence of data flows, inputs, outputs, or suspicious constructs. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Assigned to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated code, and security risk, which aligns with the code's simplicity.  \n   **Suggestion**: The scores seem appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports assign a risk of 0, indicating no security concern, there's no need for higher scores.  \n   **Conclusion**: Scores are justified as is.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus solely on static analysis and standard practices.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements.  \n- The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified.  \n- Given the high confidence (1), the assessment aligns well with the code's simplicity.\n\n**My Overall Estimate**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Security Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Summary**:  \nThis is a benign, standard version declaration snippet with no security concerns.",
