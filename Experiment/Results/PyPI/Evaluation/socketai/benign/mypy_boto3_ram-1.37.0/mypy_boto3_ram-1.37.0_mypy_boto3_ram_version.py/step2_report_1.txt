  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports agree that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`, with no dynamic behavior, inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The code is minimal, standard, and free of any suspicious or malicious constructs. Therefore, **no issues are present** in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly identify the code as benign, with no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent. No logical flaws are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign scores of 1 for confidence, and 0 for obfuscated, malware, and security risk. These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports conclude zero risk, malware, and obfuscation, and the code is straightforward, there is no justification for higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature. No malicious activity is detected or implied.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All claims are based on static analysis and are reasonable. No suspicious assumptions are made.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. They appropriately reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (a minimal risk, primarily due to the presence of version info, but practically none)  \n\n**Overall, the code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns.**",
