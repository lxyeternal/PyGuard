  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code review:**\nThe code consists solely of a comment and a static assignment:\n```python\n\"\"\"\nSource of truth for version.\n\nCopyright 2025 Vlad Emelianov\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"1.37.0\"\n```\nThere are no inputs, outputs, external data flows, dynamic behaviors, or suspicious constructs. It is a typical version declaration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward and standard; no issues are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports?**  \n  All reports correctly identify the code as a benign version declaration with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**  \n  All reports assign malware and securityRisk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:**  \n  All reports assign obfuscated=0, which is correct.\n\n- **Justification for high risk scores (>0.5)?**  \n  None of the reports do this; all scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n- **Malware scores:**  \n  Correctly set to 0; no malicious activity.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports avoid assumptions and correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  All scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the code as benign.\n- No report overestimates risk or malware potential.\n- The code does not contain obfuscation, dynamic code, or any suspicious elements.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the simplicity and transparency of the code, I agree with all reports' conclusions. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at **0**.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is a standard version string declaration with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard version declaration. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
