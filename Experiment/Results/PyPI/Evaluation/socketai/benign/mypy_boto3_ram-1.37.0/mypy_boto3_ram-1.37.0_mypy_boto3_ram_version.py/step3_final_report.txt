  "purpose": "Declare the version of the software package.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of __version__ variable; no external data sources or inputs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment without data flow or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward version string declaration with comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment and a static assignment of a version string to __version__, with no dynamic behavior, inputs, outputs, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no suspicious or malicious constructs. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate given the simplicity and transparency of the code. No anomalies or potential security issues are present. The code is a standard version declaration used in many projects, posing no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate and consistent; no adjustments are necessary.",
