  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no anomalies; only version declaration and comment",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a comment with copyright information and a variable assignment for __version__, which is a standard practice for version tracking. There are no inputs, no processing, and no suspicious or malicious code segments. The code does not perform any data operations or network actions. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are present. The simplicity and transparency suggest it is a benign version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version assignment with no malicious intent or security risks. It serves solely as a metadata marker and contains no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
