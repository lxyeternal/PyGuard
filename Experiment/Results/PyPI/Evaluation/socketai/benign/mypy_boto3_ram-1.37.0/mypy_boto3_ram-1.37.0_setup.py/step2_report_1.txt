  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions with the code, and assess the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- The code is a standard Python setup script, importing `setuptools`, reading a README for the long description, and passing static metadata to `setup()`.\n- No user input, network operations, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic are present.\n- The dependencies are explicitly listed, and the package data is straightforward.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious file operations, or malicious code are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes a setup script reading README.md and configuring package metadata.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or dynamic code.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correct; the script is legitimate, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Verdict:** **Correct.** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct; standard package setup.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous operations.\n- **Anomalies:** None.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Valid; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.  \n**Verdict:** **Correct.** The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- Same reasoning as above; standard setup script, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** All zeroes, which aligns with the code.\n**Verdict:** **Correct.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- Similar to previous; straightforward setup script.\n- **Scores:** All zeroes, consistent with the code.\n**Verdict:** **Correct.**\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- Same assessment: no dynamic or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All zeroes.\n**Verdict:** **Correct.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary of all reports:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all cases, consistent with the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since the script is a standard setup configuration with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\nGiven the code and reports, I concur with the assessments. The setup script is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe.
