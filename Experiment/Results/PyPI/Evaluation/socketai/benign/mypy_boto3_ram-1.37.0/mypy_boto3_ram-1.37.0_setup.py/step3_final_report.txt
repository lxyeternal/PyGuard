{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the 'mypy-boto3-ram' library, configuring metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static metadata and dependencies defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no dynamic code execution or network operations.",
  "flows": "Static data flows from file read and static parameters into setuptools.setup() without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static configuration with no obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup script that imports setuptools, reads a local README file, and calls setup() with predefined parameters. No user input, network activity, or code obfuscation is present. All dependencies are explicitly listed, and no secrets or dynamic behaviors are used. The code adheres to standard packaging practices, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup file with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors detected. All reports correctly assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and risk, which is appropriate given the code's static and straightforward nature.",
