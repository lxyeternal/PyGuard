{
  "purpose": "The script sets up a Python package named 'mypy-boto3-ram' with metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the __file__ path to load README.md content; uses setuptools.setup to configure package installation.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted input; primarily configures package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Reads file for description -> passes static data to setup function -> installs dependencies based on static conditions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code; standard setup script structure with no dynamic or risky behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical package setup: reading a README for description, defining metadata, specifying dependencies, and configuring package data. No external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious file operations beyond reading a static README.md file. The dependencies are explicitly listed and there are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code injections. The license and author info are straightforward. All operations are consistent with standard Python packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate, standard setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
