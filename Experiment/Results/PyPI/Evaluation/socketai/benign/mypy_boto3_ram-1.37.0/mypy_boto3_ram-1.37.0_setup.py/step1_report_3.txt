{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up and configuring the Python package 'mypy-boto3-ram' with metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; no other data input sources present.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools.setup() which executes package installation routines; no dangerous sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads file content (long description) then passes static configuration data to setup(), no dynamic or untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The only file read is a static README.md; no obfuscated or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, importing pathlib and setuptools, reading a README file for long description, and passing static metadata to the setup() function. There are no dynamic inputs, no external code execution beyond the normal package setup process, and no suspicious code structures or obfuscated logic. The dependencies and package data are straightforward and appropriate for the package purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply prepares package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
