  "purpose": "This setup script is used to configure the packaging and distribution of the Python library 'mypy-boto3-ram'.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description; reads package data; specifies dependencies and metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data flows into sensitive operations; no external commands or system calls executed.",
  "flows": "No suspicious data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The script performs standard setup tasks.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules, reads the README for long description, and calls setup() with package metadata. All operations are typical for a Python package setup file. No external input, user data, or command execution is present. Dependencies are straightforward and environment-specific. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
