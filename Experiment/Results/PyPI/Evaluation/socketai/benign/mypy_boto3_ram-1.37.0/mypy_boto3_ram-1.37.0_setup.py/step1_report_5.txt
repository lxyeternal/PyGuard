{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the mypy-boto3-ram package, used for installing type annotations and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, imports setuptools, and uses package metadata from the script.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points where untrusted data could be exploited or cause harm.",
  "flows": "Reads local file for description -> executes setup function with package info and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network calls.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and uses setuptools for package setup. It reads a local file for the long description and sets up package metadata, dependencies, and URLs. All actions are typical for a Python package setup script. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or code injection. The only external dependency is a versioned install_requires, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
