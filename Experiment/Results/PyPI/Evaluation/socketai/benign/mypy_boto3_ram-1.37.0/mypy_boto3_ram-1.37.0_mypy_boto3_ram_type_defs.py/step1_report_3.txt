  "purpose": "Type annotations and structured data definitions for AWS RAM service SDK in Python, enabling type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, datetime, and local modules; class definitions; TypedDict declarations.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code defines types and data structures only.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow; standard use of conditional imports for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, conditional imports for type compatibility, and a series of TypedDict class definitions for AWS RAM data structures. No dynamic code execution, external data processing, or suspicious logic is present. It adheres to standard Python typing practices for SDK definitions. The only potential concern is the conditional import logic, which is common for compatibility but not malicious. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of type definitions and imports aimed at facilitating type safety in AWS SDK for Python. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements. Overall, the code appears safe and standard for SDK type annotations.",
