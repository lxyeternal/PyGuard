{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS RAM service API requests and responses using TypedDict, facilitating type checking and code clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party typing_extensions, and internal literals; all data is defined via TypedDict structures.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; data is primarily for type annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external or untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines data structures without executing logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code; code strictly defines type annotations and data structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for type annotations and version compatibility, then defines multiple TypedDict classes representing request and response schemas for AWS RAM API. The definitions include fields with type annotations, optionality, and structure, with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions present. There are no signs of code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The structure is consistent with standard SDK type definitions, and no suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured set of type definitions for AWS RAM SDK, with no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks. It solely provides data schemas for API interaction, and there are no signs of malware or malicious behaviors.",
