{
  "purpose": "Type annotations for AWS RAM service data structures used in boto3-stubs for type checking.",
  "sources": "Imported modules (sys, datetime, typing_extensions, builtins), external literals module, and defined TypedDict classes for API data types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; only static type definitions and imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external inputs to sensitive sinks; solely type definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns observed. Usage of sys.version_info for conditional imports is standard. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines type aliases and TypedDict classes for AWS RAM API responses and requests, with conditional imports based on Python version for compatibility. No execution of untrusted code, no data leaks, or malicious behavior detected. The initial imports, including sys, datetime, and typing_extensions, are standard. The type definitions are straightforward, serving as static type annotations. No signs of malware, such as network activity, file manipulation, or backdoors, are present. The code appears to be purely for type checking and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This source code contains no malicious behavior, no malware, and poses no security threat. It is a collection of static type definitions for AWS RAM API operations intended for use with type checkers like mypy. The code is well-structured, with conditional imports to support different Python versions, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious elements.",
