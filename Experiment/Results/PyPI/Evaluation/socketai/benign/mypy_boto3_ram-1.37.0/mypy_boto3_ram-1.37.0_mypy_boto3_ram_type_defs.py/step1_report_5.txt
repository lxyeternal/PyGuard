{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS RAM service requests and responses, providing structured data models for SDK interactions.",
  "sources": "Code reads external Python modules (__future__, sys, datetime, typing_extensions), imports literals, and defines TypedDict structures.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data directly or execute code based on external input; primarily static type definitions.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows or untrusted data processing; data structures are statically defined with optional fields.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code strictly defines data models using TypedDict, with no dynamic or reflective operations.",
  "analysis": "The code employs conditional imports based on Python version, which is standard for compatibility. All type definitions are static and well-structured, with no runtime evaluation or code execution. No external data sources, inputs, or untrusted data handling is present. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The use of NotRequired and TypedDict aligns with normal SDK pattern practices. Overall, the code appears purely as a type definition module for SDK purposes, with no malicious or security-compromising elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static set of type definitions for AWS RAM SDK requests and responses. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is safe and intended for type hinting and static analysis. The overall security risk is negligible.",
