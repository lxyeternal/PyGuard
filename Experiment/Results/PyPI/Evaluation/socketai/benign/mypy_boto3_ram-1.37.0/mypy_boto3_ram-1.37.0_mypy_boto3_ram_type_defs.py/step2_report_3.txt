  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is solely composed of static type definitions using TypedDict.\n   - No executable logic, data handling, or external interactions are present.\n   - The code imports standard libraries, conditional imports for compatibility, and internal literals—typical for SDK type annotations.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely for type annotations, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to malware, obfuscation, and security risk:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, and security risk of 0.\n   - These scores are reasonable given the nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for high risk scores:**\n   - The code does not perform any runtime operations, network calls, or data processing.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present.\n   - The only potential concern is the conditional import logic, which is standard for compatibility and not malicious.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as static type definitions.\n   - No overreach in their conclusions.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the analysis:**\n   - The assigned scores align with the detailed reasoning.\n   - No inconsistencies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — No obfuscation; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — No security risks identified; purely static type definitions.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured set of type annotations for AWS SDK, intended to aid static analysis and type checking.\n- No signs of sabotage, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The report's evaluation is accurate and justified. The code is safe, with no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nI agree with the provided assessments. The overall security risk is negligible, and the code is purely for static type annotations. No changes to scores are necessary.",
