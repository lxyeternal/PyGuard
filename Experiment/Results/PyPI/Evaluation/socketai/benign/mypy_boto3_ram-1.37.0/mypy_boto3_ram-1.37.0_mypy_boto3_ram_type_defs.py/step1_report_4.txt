{
  "purpose": "Type definitions for AWS RAM service API request and response structures, used for type hinting and validation.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and data structure definitions primarily in class and variable declarations; no external data input sources within this code.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data might be in 'ResponseMetadata' and various request parameters, but these are intended for internal or API use, not for executing or affecting system behavior directly.",
  "flows": "Data flows are from function parameters and class attributes to the type definitions; no runtime data flow or execution logic is present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code consists solely of TypedDict class definitions with standard type annotations; no dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of Python type hinting definitions using TypedDict, with conditional imports based on Python version, adhering to standard practices. It imports constants from a local module and defines numerous data structures for API requests and responses, with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. No malicious patterns or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of type definitions for AWS RAM SDK, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a well-structured, standard type hinting module for API schema validation.",
