  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definition for the AWS RAM (Resource Access Manager) service, providing method signatures for interacting with RAM API endpoints.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, typing, botocore modules, and local type definition modules. The class and method signatures extract data from these imports.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters and return types that accept or return data, including parameters for API calls such as 'Params', 'Params', and other request/response types. No execution of untrusted input is visible.",
  "flows": "Input data from method parameters flows to API call preparations, and responses are returned as specified types. No dynamic code execution, eval, or exec detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors present. The code consists mainly of method signatures, type annotations, and imports. No suspicious network activity, file access, or system modification code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a client class definition for the AWS RAM service, including method signatures, property accessors, and overloads for paginators. It is structured with proper type annotations, imports, and documentation links. No code appears to perform malicious actions, such as network communication beyond prescribed API calls, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code is primarily boilerplate for type safety and API interaction, with no runtime logic or dynamic execution. The presence of only class/method signatures and type annotations indicates it is a stub or interface layer, not executable logic containing malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured stub/interface definition for the AWS RAM client with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is purely for type checking and documentation purposes, with no executable malicious logic.",
