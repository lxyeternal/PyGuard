  "purpose": "Type annotations and client class definitions for AWS RAM SDK, serving as static type hints and interface wrappers.",
  "sources": "Imported modules, class method signatures, type definitions, and documentation links.",
  "sinks": "Method parameters (mostly **kwargs) passed into SDK calls; no data leaks or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into AWS SDK methods; no runtime data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static SDK interface with extensive type annotations, method signatures, and documentation. It does not contain executable logic, data processing, or network activity. The use of **kwargs is standard for boto3 clients, and no obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The high-confidence assessments in the reports align with the code's static, interface-only nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured static type stub for AWS RAM, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is minimal (~0.1). It is safe for use as a static SDK interface.",
