  "purpose": "Type annotations and client interface for AWS RAM service, providing method signatures and exception handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, botocore, and local modules; class and method definitions; property and overload declarations.",
  "sinks": "Method implementations that invoke AWS APIs via boto3, potentially passing untrusted parameters through **kwargs.",
  "flows": "External input (kwargs) flows into method calls which then interact with AWS services via boto3 methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No hidden code or obfuscation detected. Usage of external AWS SDKs and standard typing is normal.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a typed client interface for AWS RAM with method signatures, type annotations, and exception handling. It imports standard libraries and local modules, and uses method overloads to specify API behaviors. No code performs data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication. The use of **kwargs and method signatures suggests parameter passing to AWS SDK functions, which is standard for boto3 clients. No suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent is evident. The overall structure and content align with a typical SDK interface with detailed type hints, offering no indication of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface for AWS RAM with no malicious or suspicious elements. It serves as a type-safe wrapper around boto3 client calls, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
