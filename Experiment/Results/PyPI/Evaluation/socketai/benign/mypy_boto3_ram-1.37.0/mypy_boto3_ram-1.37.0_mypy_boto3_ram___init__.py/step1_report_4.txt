{
  "purpose": "Provides a main interface for RAM (Resource Access Manager) service, defining imports and exposing classes and constants for client interaction.",
  "sources": "Reads input data primarily from user code invoking the module and the imported modules themselves.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; code mainly sets up class references and exports.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow paths from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; primarily import statements and constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual patterns observed. The code appears straightforward and conventional.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python module that imports classes and functions, defines a client alias, and specifies exports. It contains no dynamic code execution, external data processing, or network operations. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors. It is a clean, well-structured module intended for SDK-like usage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard interface module for AWS RAM service, with no malicious or suspicious elements detected. It functions as intended for SDK purposes without any hidden or malicious behavior.",
