  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a simple interface, importing classes from internal modules and providing documentation. No untrusted input or data sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** The only unusual aspect is the copyright year 2025, which is in the future, but this is likely a typo or placeholder, not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious patterns, no malware, no obfuscation, and no malicious intent. The code is benign.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup with local module imports and documentation.\n- **Anomalies:** The future copyright year (2025) is suspicious but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity or malicious patterns.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, a straightforward setup for AWS SDK interactions.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies; standard class and function exports.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard module setup with no untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign, SDK-like interface code.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—simple import and export setup.\n- **Anomalies:** None detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly benign.\n\n**Score assessment:**  \n- Malware: 0 (correct)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- Risk: 0 (correct)\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity; all are 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, as the code is straightforward and unobfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, as there are no vulnerabilities, malicious intent, or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Final thoughts:\n- The code is a standard, well-structured SDK interface module with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements.\n- The only minor anomaly is the future copyright year, which does not impact security.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign and poses no security threat.",
