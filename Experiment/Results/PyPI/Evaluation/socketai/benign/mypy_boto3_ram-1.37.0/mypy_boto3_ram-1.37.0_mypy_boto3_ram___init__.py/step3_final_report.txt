{
  "purpose": "This module provides a Python SDK interface for AWS RAM, exposing classes and paginators for resource sharing management.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.client and .paginator), documentation string, no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; no network activity or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and class exports, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The copyright year is set to 2025, which is in the future and unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK wrapper module with imports, class aliasing, and export definitions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The documentation provides usage examples, and the structure is typical for SDK modules. The only anomaly is the future copyright year, which is likely a placeholder or typo. No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements. The high confidence in this assessment is justified by the straightforward nature of the code and absence of any malicious patterns.",
