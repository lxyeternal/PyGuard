{
  "purpose": "Main interface for the RAM (Resource Access Manager) service, providing access to paginators and client class for interacting with AWS RAM.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator) and inline documentation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or code execution points; mainly module exports and documentation.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; only module imports, class assignments, and documentation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module imports, documentation, class assignment, and exports. It defines a client class and paginator types for AWS RAM, with no user input handling, network operations, or data processing. The comments and documentation are standard for SDK interfaces. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, benign SDK interface module with no malicious or security-threatening elements. It simply exposes client and paginator classes for AWS RAM usage.",
