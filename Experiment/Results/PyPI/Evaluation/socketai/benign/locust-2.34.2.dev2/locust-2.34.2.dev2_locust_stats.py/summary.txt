  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent performance monitoring module. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The assigned scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate. The risk score could be slightly lowered from 0.9–0.95 to around 0.8, reflecting the low inherent risk, but the current conservative scores are acceptable."
