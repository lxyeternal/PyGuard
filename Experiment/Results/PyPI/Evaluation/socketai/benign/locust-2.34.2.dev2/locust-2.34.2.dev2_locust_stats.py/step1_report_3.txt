{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for collecting, processing, and exporting HTTP request and response statistics, primarily for performance testing and monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, and system calls (e.g., os.get_terminal_size()). Uses time.time() and time.sleep() for timing and interval control.",
  "sinks": "Data is output via CSV writers, logging, and print statements. No untrusted data is directly written to external systems or network destinations within this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as request logs and error records into internal data structures; then is serialized, formatted, and written to CSV files or logs. No evidence of untrusted data affecting system commands or external services.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variable names are detected. The code uses standard Python libraries and normal patterns for statistical data collection.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles statistical aggregation of request data, error tracking, and output formatting. It uses standard practices for data collection, such as response time measurement, error serialization, and percentile calculations. No suspicious network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The logging and error handling are typical for such monitoring tools. The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials or external network calls outside of data serialization and file output. There are no signs of malicious payloads or sabotage functions. The only potential concern might be extensive file handling, but this aligns with intended data reporting functions and does not pose a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, well-structured statistics collection and reporting module for load testing or monitoring. There are no indications of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It performs data collection, error tracking, and CSV output in a normal manner without any suspicious features.",
