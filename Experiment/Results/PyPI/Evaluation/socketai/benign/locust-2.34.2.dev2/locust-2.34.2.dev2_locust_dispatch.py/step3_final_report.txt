{
  "purpose": "A load testing utility that manages user dispatch, spawn rates, and rebalancing across worker nodes.",
  "sources": "User class definitions, weights, worker node data, internal state variables, and generator functions.",
  "sinks": "Internal data structures; no external data leaks or network communications observed.",
  "flows": "Generators produce user sequences; dispatchers modify internal state; worker nodes are assigned users based on generator outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a transparent, purpose-built load testing dispatcher utilizing standard libraries and practices. It manages user distribution, rate control, and rebalancing without external network calls or data exfiltration. The use of 'gevent' is typical for asynchronous load testing. No malicious or obfuscated code elements are present. The logic is consistent, well-structured, and aligns with load testing objectives.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate load testing utility with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The overall assessment indicates a safe, purpose-driven implementation.",
