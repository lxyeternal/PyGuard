{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error conditions in a Python application, likely related to a load testing framework.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code only defines classes and constructors.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling functions; no processing of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; purely class definitions and exception raising patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. All classes inherit from Exception or Exception subclasses, with standard constructors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application, likely a load testing tool such as Locust. There are no dynamic code executions, input/output operations, or network communications within this code fragment. The constructors are straightforward, with one class accepting an optional address parameter, but no malicious or suspicious logic present. The code appears to serve purely as error signaling and control flow management, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions for a Python application. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain security risks, or malware. It functions solely to define error types for internal handling. Overall, the code is safe, well-structured, and non-malicious.",
