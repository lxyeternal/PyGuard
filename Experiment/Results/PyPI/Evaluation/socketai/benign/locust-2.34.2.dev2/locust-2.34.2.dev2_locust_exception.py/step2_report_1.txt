  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code only defines custom exception classes inheriting from Python's `Exception`.\n   - No dynamic code, input/output, network calls, or data processing.\n   - The constructors are straightforward, with one class (`RPCReceiveError`) accepting an optional `addr` parameter, which is standard for passing contextual info.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or code injection.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is purely for error signaling and control flow.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are evident in the class definitions.\n   - No overstatement of risks; the analysis is consistent with the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence levels are 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all evidence points to benign, standard exception class definitions, there's no justification for higher risk scores.\n   - No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain threats.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - No malicious activity detected.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and base their conclusions on the code's content.\n   - They correctly interpret the purpose of the classes without overreach.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall Justification:**\nThe code is a straightforward set of custom exception classes used in a testing or network framework. There are no signs of malicious intent, data exfiltration, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The high confidence and zero scores are justified.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- No malicious or security issues are present.\n- The scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores: **malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0**.",
