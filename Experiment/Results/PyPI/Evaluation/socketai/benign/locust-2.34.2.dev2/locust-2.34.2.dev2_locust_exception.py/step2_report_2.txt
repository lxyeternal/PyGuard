  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions.\n- No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.\n- The exception classes are standard and serve typical control flow purposes within a framework, likely Locust or similar.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is straightforward, with only one class (`RPCReceiveError`) including an additional parameter (`addr`). This is a common pattern for passing contextual info and does not introduce security risks.\n- The scores assigned for malware (all 0) are appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports uniformly assign a security risk of 0 and malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code.\n- The reasoning is sound: these are benign exception class definitions.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- No changes needed to the scores or reasoning.\n- The assessments are accurate: the code is safe, non-malicious, and standard for error handling.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the code's nature.",
