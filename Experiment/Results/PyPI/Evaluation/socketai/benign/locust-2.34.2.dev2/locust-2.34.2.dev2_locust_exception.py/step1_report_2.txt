  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a load testing framework, primarily for handling various error scenarios during test execution.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions and their initializers; no external input reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling observed; code primarily raises exceptions internally.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and raising within test execution flow; no external data flow or untrusted data processing detected.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward custom exception class definitions, inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data processing occurs. The only slight complexity involves passing additional parameters such as 'reschedule' or 'addr' to exception constructors, which are used for control flow within the framework but do not pose security risks. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely defining exception classes for internal use within a load testing framework. No malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain threats are present in this code. It is standard and benign.",
