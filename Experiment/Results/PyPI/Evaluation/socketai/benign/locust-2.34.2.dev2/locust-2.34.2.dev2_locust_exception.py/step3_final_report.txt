{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes used for error handling and control flow within a load testing or networked application framework, likely Locust.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that instantiate exception objects, some with additional parameters (e.g., 'addr' in RPCReceiveError, 'reschedule' in InterruptTaskSet).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs; the code only raises or catches exceptions internally.",
  "flows": "Exception objects are created and raised within the application to control flow; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard exception class definitions. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception, with some constructors passing additional context. No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing occurs. The classes serve as control flow mechanisms, typical in frameworks like Locust. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The exception classes are standard and benign, with no evidence of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely for error handling, with no malicious or security-threatening elements. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are correctly set to 0, reflecting the safe and standard nature of the code.",
