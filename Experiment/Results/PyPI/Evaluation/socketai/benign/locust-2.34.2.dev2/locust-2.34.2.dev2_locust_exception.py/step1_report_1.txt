  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various error conditions in a performance testing framework (possibly Locust).",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception initializations; no external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation and raising within the framework; no flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. Exception classes are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception base class. The classes are named to reflect specific error conditions, with some containing custom __init__ methods to include additional data (e.g., addr in RPCReceiveError). There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is well-structured and conventional for exception handling. No suspicious imports or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines standard custom exception classes for a performance testing or networked application framework. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
