  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code solely consists of custom exception class definitions.\n- No external data input, network communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The exception classes are straightforward, with some including additional parameters for control flow.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are detected.\n- The purpose appears to be internal error handling within a load testing or networked application framework, likely Locust.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not perform any malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n- The exception classes are standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.\n- The inclusion of parameters like `addr` or `reschedule` is for control flow, not malicious intent.\n- The malware score is correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n\n**Scores and Justification:**\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — No obfuscation present; code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — No security risk, as the code is purely defining exception classes with no external dependencies or data processing.\n\n**Potential Adjustments:**\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is benign, standard exception class definitions for internal error handling.\n- No security concerns, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, well-structured set of custom exception classes used for error handling in a performance testing framework. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
