{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for various error conditions in a testing or networked application framework.",
  "sources": "Exception classes are defined but do not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leakage points present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; these are purely class definitions for exception handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; exception classes are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions, with some including detailed docstrings explaining their purpose. There are no operations, data processing, network interactions, or dynamic code execution present. The classes are standard Python exceptions with no malicious or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected. Overall, this code appears to be a standard part of a larger framework for error handling, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of exception class definitions intended for structured error handling in a framework. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and typical for its purpose.",
