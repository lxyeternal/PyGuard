  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a testing or network environment.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; all are class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output; these are exception classes only.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines exceptions without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class definitions with no unusual code or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes, mainly used for controlling flow in a testing framework or network communication. No input/output, data leaks, or malicious code is present. No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are evident. The use of exception classes is standard for such applications. No potential attack vectors or malicious behavior is observable from the class definitions alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of exception class definitions intended for use in a network or testing framework. There is no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears to be benign and solely for error handling purposes.",
