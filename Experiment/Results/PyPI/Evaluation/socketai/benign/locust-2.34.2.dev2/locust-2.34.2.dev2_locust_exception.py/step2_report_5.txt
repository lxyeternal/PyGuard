  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Purpose:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code consists solely of custom exception class definitions.\n   - The classes inherit from Python's `Exception` or specialized subclasses.\n   - Some classes include simple constructors with additional parameters (e.g., `addr` in `RPCReceiveError`, `reschedule` in `InterruptTaskSet`).\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n   - No dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of untrusted data within this snippet.\n   - The exception classes serve as control flow mechanisms, which is standard practice.\n\n3. **Analysis of Potential Risks:**\n   - The exception classes are straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent.\n   - The inclusion of extra parameters in constructors is typical for conveying context, not malicious behavior.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or obfuscation are present.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code content.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Flaws:**\n   - No logical flaws or errors are identified.\n   - The code is consistent and clear.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made, and the code does not seem to facilitate any.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard, benign set of exception class definitions.\n   - No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected.\n   - The scores assigned by all reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the thorough review, I agree with the provided scores. The code is entirely benign, serving only as structured error handling within a framework, likely Locust or similar.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.  \n- Exception classes are standard and safe.  \n- Scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe and the scores are justified.",
