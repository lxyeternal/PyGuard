  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - The code is a straightforward, auto-generated module that defines version metadata for a Python package.\n   - It assigns static version strings and tuples, with no dynamic behavior, input handling, or external data processing.\n   - The conditional type hinting logic is standard and safe, used solely for development-time type checking.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:\n   - No untrusted input sources, data sinks, or external calls.\n   - No obfuscation, code injection, or backdoors.\n   - The version string includes a development suffix ('dev2'), which is typical and not malicious.\n   - The code's purpose is purely for metadata and package version management.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Report**:\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature of the code, noting its generated, static, and metadata-oriented purpose.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks are identified.\n   - The scores assigned—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0—are consistent with the code's content.\n\n4. **Score Justification**:\n   - Since the code is static, auto-generated, and has no malicious features, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscation is not present; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - Security risk is minimal to none, given the lack of dynamic behavior or external dependencies.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - No concerns or assumptions are made about vulnerabilities, as none are evident.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (code is clear, straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is a benign, auto-generated version metadata module with no security risks, malware, or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nI concur with the reports' assessments. No further action or concern is necessary.",
