  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, primarily for use in versioning and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and version tuple variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows into external systems or outputs based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Direct assignment of static version strings and tuples; no flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version variables, assigns static version strings and tuples, and includes conditional typing imports. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, no external data handling, and no suspicious or malicious patterns. It is a typical version declaration generated by a version management tool, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe version information module with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It serves its purpose of version declaration without introducing any risk.",
