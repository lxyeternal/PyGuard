  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sources or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version string to version variables, no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns or unusual constructs. The version string includes a development suffix 'dev2'.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables for package identification, using static strings and tuples. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious behavior. The version string indicates a development version but does not pose security risks. The structure is typical for auto-generated version info files, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard version info module generated by setuptools-scm, with no malicious behavior or security issues. It serves to provide version metadata in a safe manner.",
