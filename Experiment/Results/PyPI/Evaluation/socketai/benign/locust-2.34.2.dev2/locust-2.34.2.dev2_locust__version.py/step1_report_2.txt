{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, primarily for package version management and type hinting.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version variables (__version__, version, __version_tuple__, version_tuple) and the initial module comments.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data sinks or external data outputs, no use of untrusted inputs or external resources.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of version strings and tuples to internal variables; no flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward version assignment, no suspicious or unusual code behavior. The only dynamic aspect is the version string, which is statically assigned.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard version metadata module, generated by a known tool (setuptools-scm). It includes type hinting conditional logic but does not execute any untrusted code or perform external operations. The version string is hardcoded, and no external inputs or data manipulations are present. The structure and comments indicate intended use for package version management, with no malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version information module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to store version data for the package, with no external data handling or suspicious features.",
