{
  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, including version strings and tuples, generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings and version tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Direct assignment from static values to variables, no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, or unusual behavior. The code is straightforward and primarily for metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally defines a type hinting alias 'VERSION_TUPLE' and assigns static version data to variables. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or external data processing occurs. The version data appears to be generated automatically and is static. There are no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The code fulfills its purpose of defining package version information safely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version metadata module with no malicious intent or security risks.",
