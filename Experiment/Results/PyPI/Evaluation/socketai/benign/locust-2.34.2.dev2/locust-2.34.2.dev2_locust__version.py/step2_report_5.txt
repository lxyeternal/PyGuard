  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report in detail:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is static, auto-generated by setuptools-scm.\n- No untrusted inputs, external data, or dynamic code execution.\n- Variables are assigned static version strings and tuples.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or backdoors are evident.\n- The purpose is solely to provide version metadata.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Justification:** Fully benign; no issues.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, standard version info code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Justification:** No malicious intent or security concern.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; the presence of a 'dev2' suffix indicates a development version, but this is typical.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Justification:** No security risk; version suffix does not imply maliciousness.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard version info code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Justification:** No issues detected.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous; no suspicious features.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0\n- **Justification:** Safe and straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. I agree with a malware score of 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is clear, with no obfuscation. The score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Since the code is static, auto-generated, and solely metadata, the risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- No evidence suggests any hidden malicious behavior.\n- The code is typical boilerplate for version management, with no vulnerabilities or attack vectors.\n- The version string including 'dev2' does not pose a security concern; it's a common development suffix.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Working out the reasoning step-by-step:**\n- Confirmed code is static, auto-generated, and contains no suspicious features.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources.\n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- The version string is standard and indicates a development build, which is typical.\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n\n**Therefore, I conclude that the overall assessment is accurate, and the scores are appropriate.**",
