  "purpose": "Define version metadata for a Python package, auto-generated by setuptools-scm.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version string '__version__' and version tuple '__version_tuple__'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version string to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'dev2' suffix indicating a development version, which is standard and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is static, auto-generated, and solely for version information. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns. The conditional type checking is standard for type hints and does not introduce security issues. No obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks are present. The version string with 'dev2' is typical for development releases and does not imply malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of this code, with appropriate malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version metadata module with no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
