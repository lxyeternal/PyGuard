  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is static, auto-generated, and contains no malicious activity.\n- Correctly notes no data flow from untrusted sources, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk score: 0 — justified, as there's no security concern.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Also correctly identifies the code as benign, with no external data or dynamic code.\n- The only notable point is the 'dev2' suffix, which is typical for development versions.\n- Malware score: 0 — accurate.\n- Risk score: 0 — justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizes the static nature and standard pattern.\n- Notes the version string includes 'dev2', but this does not introduce risk.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Reiterates the straightforward, auto-generated nature.\n- No anomalies or suspicious features.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also confirms benign, static code with no external dependencies or dynamic logic.\n- No obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is static, auto-generated, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None detected; all reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all appropriately 0, and the security risk scores are justified as 0.\n- **Assumptions:** No unfounded assumptions are made; the analysis is based on static inspection.\n- **Consistency:** The scores align with the code's nature.\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the code's straightforward, static, auto-generated nature, **no changes are necessary** to the reports' scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied).\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present).\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk).\n\nThis code is a benign, standard version metadata module with no security concerns.",
