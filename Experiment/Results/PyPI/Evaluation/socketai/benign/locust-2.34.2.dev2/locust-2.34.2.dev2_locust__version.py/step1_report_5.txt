  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools-scm, with no operational logic.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, import statements under TYPE_CHECKING condition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static version data to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, generated by a standard tool, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version variables for a Python package, using static assignments and type checking imports. No dynamic execution, network calls, or sensitive data handling are present. It appears to be auto-generated boilerplate code for version management, with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version information module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
