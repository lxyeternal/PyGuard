  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Confirms the code is static, auto-generated, with no untrusted inputs or external data flows.\n- Correctly identifies that the code is benign, primarily for metadata.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk score: 0 — justified, as no security concern exists.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the static nature and lack of external data handling.\n- Correctly notes the version string includes a development suffix ('dev2') but that does not pose a security risk.\n- Malware score: 0 — appropriate.\n- Risk score: 0 — justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Reiterates the same points: static assignment, no external data, typical version info.\n- Notes the version is a development version, but this is standard and not risky.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Same conclusions: straightforward, generated code, no malicious behavior.\n- No anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Similar to others, confirms no dynamic code, external data, or suspicious patterns.\n- No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Risk score: 0.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is static, auto-generated, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The version string including 'dev2' is typical for development versions and does not indicate any security concern.\n- The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate; there's no malicious activity or code behavior.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks are present in this code.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign, auto-generated version metadata module with no security issues, malicious intent, or obfuscation. All reports are consistent with this assessment.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
