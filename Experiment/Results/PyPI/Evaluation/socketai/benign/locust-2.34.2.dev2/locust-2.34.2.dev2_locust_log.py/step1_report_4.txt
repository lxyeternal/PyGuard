{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to configure and manage logging for an application, including custom log handling and exception logging in greenlets.",
  "sources": "Reading system hostname, function parameters, imported modules, and environment variables related to logging configuration.",
  "sinks": "Logging output to console, files, and in-memory deque; exception handling in greenlets.",
  "flows": "Hostname and logging configuration data flow to logging handlers; exception info flows from greenlets to log functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or malicious code. Use of global variables is standard in this context. No obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic code execution, or misleading variable names observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a logging setup with configurable handlers including console, file, and in-memory logs. The get_logs function retrieves in-memory logs. The greenlet_exception_logger creates an exception handler that logs unhandled exceptions. The code uses standard libraries and does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident. The only notable aspect is its focus on logging and exception management, which is typical for monitoring or debugging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward logging setup and exception handler implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not include network activity, data leaks, or backdoors. The design appears to be purely for application monitoring and debugging.",
