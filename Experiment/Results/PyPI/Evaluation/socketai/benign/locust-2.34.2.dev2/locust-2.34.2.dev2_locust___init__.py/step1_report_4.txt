  "purpose": "Configure environment and import modules for a load testing framework, likely Locust, with conditional patching and versioning.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LOCUST_PLAYWRIGHT, LOCUST_SKIP_MONKEY_PATCH, LOCUST_SKIP_URLLIB3_PATCH), imports from standard library (os), third-party modules (gevent, urllib3), internal modules.",
  "sinks": "os._exit(1) call (can terminate process abruptly), module imports, environment variables influencing behavior, and patching functions.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence whether trio import or gevent monkey patching occurs. These control execution flow and module patching behaviors, with potential termination via os._exit(1).",
  "anomalies": "Use of os._exit(1) to terminate process without cleanup, which may be unusual in some contexts but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code injection observed. Use of dynamic imports is standard for plugin-like behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment-based configuration for a load testing tool, with conditional imports and patching of network modules. The abrupt exit using os._exit(1) might be unusual but is likely for compatibility reasons. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The import statements and variable handling appear standard. No suspicious network activity, cryptomining, or data exfiltration observed. The code's structure aligns with typical setup scripts for such frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a configuration/setup module for a load testing framework, performing environment checks, conditional patching, and importing necessary components. No malicious behavior detected. The use of os._exit(1) may be unconventional but appears purposeful for environment handling. Overall, the code appears safe.",
