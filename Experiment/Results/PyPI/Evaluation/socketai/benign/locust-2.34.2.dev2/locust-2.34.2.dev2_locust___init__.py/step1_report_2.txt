{
  "purpose": "This code sets up environment configurations, imports modules, patches libraries for asynchronous HTTP requests, and defines exports for a locust-based load testing framework.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LOCUST_PLAYWRIGHT, LOCUST_SKIP_MONKEY_PATCH, LOCUST_SKIP_URLLIB3_PATCH), import statements, os.getenv calls, and module attributes.",
  "sinks": "os._exit(1) (termination), import statements, and attribute assignments.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence whether certain patches and imports are executed; import statements load modules based on conditions; os._exit terminates execution if certain environment variables are set.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os._exit(1) based solely on environment variable without additional validation; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs environment checks, conditional imports, and patching of libraries (gevent and urllib3). The os._exit call is a direct termination method used when a specific environment variable is set, likely for backwards compatibility or configuration purposes. No suspicious code, such as hidden network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior, is evident. The import patterns and environment variable controls are typical for configuring and patching a load testing tool. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for a load testing framework, with environment-based configuration and patching. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The use of os._exit() is a controlled termination triggered by environment variables, which is typical in such setups. Overall, it is a benign configuration script with no malicious activity detected.",
