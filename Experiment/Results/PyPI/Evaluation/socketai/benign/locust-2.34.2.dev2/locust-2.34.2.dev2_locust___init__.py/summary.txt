  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a load testing framework with environment-based configuration. No malware or backdoors are detected. The risk arises from potential environment variable misuse, but this is typical and not malicious. Scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a moderate risk score (~0.2) to reflect environment manipulation potential."
