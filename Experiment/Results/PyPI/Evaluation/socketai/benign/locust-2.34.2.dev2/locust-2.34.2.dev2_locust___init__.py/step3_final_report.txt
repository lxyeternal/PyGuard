  "purpose": "Configure environment-dependent patches, import components, and handle setup for a load testing framework.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.getenv), module imports, conditional network patching, and process termination via os._exit.",
  "sinks": "Potential for environment variables to influence network behavior or cause abrupt termination, possibly disrupting service or masking issues.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence conditional imports and runtime patching; if manipulated, they can alter network modules or trigger os._exit.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os._exit(1) for environment-based control flow; runtime patching of urllib3 connection pool class; environment variables controlling critical behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment checks and conditionally patches network modules, which is typical in load testing tools. The use of os._exit(1) is abrupt but not malicious; it likely serves to prevent further execution under certain conditions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The runtime modifications could be exploited if environment variables are maliciously set, but this is a known risk in such configurations. Overall, the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. The primary security concern is environment manipulation, which is common in such scripts but does not constitute malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a load testing framework with environment-based configuration. No malware or backdoors are detected. The risk arises from potential environment variable misuse, but this is typical and not malicious. Scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a moderate risk score (~0.2) to reflect environment manipulation potential.",
