The risk arises from potential environment variable misuse, but this is typical and not malicious. Scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a moderate risk score (~0.2) to reflect environment manipulation potential."

The assigned scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 are appropriate. The risk score could be slightly lowered from 0.9–0.95 to around 0.8, reflecting the low inherent risk, but the current conservative scores are acceptable."
