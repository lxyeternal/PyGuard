{
  "purpose": "Provides hooks for various events in Locust, enabling user-defined handlers to respond to events such as request completion, errors, and system signals.",
  "sources": "User-defined handlers added via add_listener(), internal fire() calls, and context managers for measuring request durations.",
  "sinks": "Invoked handlers may process untrusted data; no external data sources or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Handlers added via add_listener() are called in fire(); measure() context manager yields request metadata, which handlers may process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines event classes and mechanisms for registering, removing, and firing events with exception handling. It includes a context manager for measuring request durations. No external data processing, network activity, or obfuscation is present. Handlers are user-defined and could be malicious if untrusted, but this is inherent to event systems. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security flaws are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured event system component for Locust with no malicious intent or security risks. The low risk score of approximately 0.1 is justified given the potential for malicious handlers but is not a flaw in the code itself.",
