{
  "purpose": "Defines event handling classes for the Locust load testing framework, allowing registration, firing, and management of various event hooks related to load testing processes.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (logging, time, traceback, collections, contextlib, typing) and relative imports (.log, .exception). The class definitions themselves do not read external input data.",
  "sinks": "The code itself does not include any direct sinks that process untrusted data, nor does it execute external commands or handle sensitive data.",
  "flows": "The fire() method in EventHook triggers all registered handlers with provided event data. The measure() context manager yields request metadata, then fires the event with accumulated data. Event hooks are instantiated and invoked at various points in the load test lifecycle.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code primarily manages event hooks, which is standard for event-driven systems. The measure() method's automatic timing and exception handling are typical for performance measurement; no unusual or malicious logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of event classes and mechanisms for registering, removing, and firing event handlers, specifically tailored for load testing with Locust. It uses standard Python practices for event handling and context management. The methods do not execute external commands, access sensitive data, or perform network activity. Exception handling is limited to known exceptions and logging errors. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors. The overall structure appears to be well-designed, standard for an event-driven load testing framework, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate part of the Locust load testing framework's event system. It manages event hooks and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is clear, well-structured, and free from security issues or malware signals.",
