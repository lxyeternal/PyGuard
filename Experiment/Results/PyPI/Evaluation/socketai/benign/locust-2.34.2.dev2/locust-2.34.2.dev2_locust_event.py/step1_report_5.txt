{
  "purpose": "Defines event handling system for the Locust load testing framework, allowing users to attach custom behaviors to various lifecycle events.",
  "sources": "User code can add event listeners via methods like add_listener; event firing occurs in the fire() method and context-managed measure() method.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can potentially flow through event handler functions invoked during fire() or measure(), but handlers are user-defined and external to this code.",
  "flows": "Event handlers added via add_listener() are called in fire(), passing keyword arguments; measure() yields a dictionary to handlers and captures exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Use of standard Python libraries and event management patterns. No obfuscation, malicious network calls, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard event system with support for adding/removing listeners, firing events, and measuring request durations. The measure() context manager automatically calculates response times and handles exceptions. All operations are typical for event handling; no hidden or malicious behavior is evident. The code relies on user-defined handlers for executing custom logic, which is expected in an event-driven system. No suspicious imports, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no network activity are present. The class structure and flow are consistent with legitimate event management for a testing framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical implementation of an event handling system for the Locust load testing framework. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code is well-structured, uses standard patterns, and does not exhibit obfuscation or malware traits.",
