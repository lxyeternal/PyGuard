  "conclusion": "The code is a benign build hook executing standard frontend build commands during package creation. No malicious activity or supply chain vulnerabilities are present. The use of 'shell=True' is a minor concern but does not significantly impact security in this context. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
