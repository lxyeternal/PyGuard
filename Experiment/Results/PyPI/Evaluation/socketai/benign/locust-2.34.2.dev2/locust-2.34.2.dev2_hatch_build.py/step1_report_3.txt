{
  "purpose": "To run a front-end build process using yarn commands during the package build process.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SKIP_PRE_BUILD', subprocess command execution for 'yarn install' and 'yarn build'.",
  "targets": "The subprocess calls execute shell commands that could potentially run arbitrary code or commands if manipulated.",
  "flows": "If 'SKIP_PRE_BUILD' is not set, execute 'yarn install' and 'yarn build' in 'locust/webui' directory, which may run arbitrary scripts defined in package.json or yarn scripts.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'shell=True' in subprocess calls can introduce command injection risks if inputs are manipulated, although in this code the commands are static strings. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious commands detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a build hook that runs yarn commands to build front-end assets during package creation. It relies on environment variables and subprocess execution. The subprocess commands are static and intended for building front-end assets, with no evidence of malicious intent. Use of 'shell=True' poses minimal risk here since commands are fixed strings, but it's generally a point of caution. No hidden or obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code's purpose aligns with typical build processes.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard build step for a front-end project, with no evident malicious intent or malicious behavior. The use of subprocess with fixed commands is typical for build scripts. No security risks or malware indications detected.",
