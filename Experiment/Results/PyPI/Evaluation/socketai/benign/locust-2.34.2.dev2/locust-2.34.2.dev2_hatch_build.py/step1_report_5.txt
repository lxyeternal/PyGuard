  "purpose": "The code is a build hook for a Python package, responsible for building a frontend using yarn commands during the source distribution process.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SKIP_PRE_BUILD', subprocess commands 'yarn install' and 'yarn build' in the 'locust/webui' directory",
  "sinks": "Execution of subprocess commands which could potentially execute arbitrary shell commands if manipulated, but in this context, the commands are fixed strings.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check -> Conditional execution of subprocess commands -> Build commands for frontend",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'shell=True' in subprocess calls; commands are hardcoded strings which are safe in this context; no user input is incorporated.",
  "analysis": "The code checks an environment variable to determine whether to run frontend build commands using yarn. It uses subprocess.check_output with 'shell=True', which can be risky if commands were dynamic, but here, commands are static strings, reducing risk. No user input or untrusted data is used in subprocess calls. The build commands are typical for frontend build processes. No malicious or suspicious code behavior detected. The process is straightforward, intended for building a frontend, with proper error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard build process for a frontend using yarn commands, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Usage of subprocess with static commands poses minimal risk.",
