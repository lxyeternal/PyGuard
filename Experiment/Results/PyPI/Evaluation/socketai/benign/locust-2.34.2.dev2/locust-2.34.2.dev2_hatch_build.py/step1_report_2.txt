{
  "purpose": "The code is a build hook for a Python package, intended to automate the frontend build process during package creation.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SKIP_PRE_BUILD', subprocess calls to 'yarn install' and 'yarn build' in the 'locust/webui' directory.",
  "sinks": "Execution of shell commands via subprocess.check_output which could execute arbitrary commands if input is manipulated, but here the commands are static strings.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check -> Conditional execution -> Subprocess commands ('yarn install', 'yarn build')",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'shell=True' in subprocess calls, which can be risky if combined with untrusted input (not in this case, since commands are static). No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code; the code appears to be a typical build script.",
  "analysis": "The script verifies an environment variable to decide whether to build the frontend. If not skipped, it runs 'yarn install' and 'yarn build' in a specific directory, capturing output and raising errors on failure. The subprocess calls are static and intended for build automation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious command execution. The use of 'shell=True' is generally discouraged but is controlled here as commands are hardcoded.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build automation script with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It performs frontend build steps during package creation. Use of 'shell=True' warrants caution but does not appear malicious in this context.",
