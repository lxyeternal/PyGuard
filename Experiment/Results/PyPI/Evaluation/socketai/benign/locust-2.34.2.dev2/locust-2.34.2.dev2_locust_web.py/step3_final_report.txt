{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Flask-based web UI for controlling and monitoring Locust load tests, including routes for starting/stopping tests, retrieving statistics, exporting reports, and managing user sessions.",
  "sources": "HTTP request data (form data, JSON payloads, URL parameters), environment state variables, environment configuration files, and static assets served from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Responses such as JSON data, HTML templates, CSV files, and downloadable reports; environment state modifications based on user input; file serving for CSV exports.",
  "flows": "User inputs from web forms and URL parameters are processed and used to update environment settings or trigger actions; data flows from request handlers into environment state or into generated responses/files.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; use of 'json.loads(request.data)' without explicit validation, but within a controlled web UI context. Proper escaping and sanitization are applied to outputs. No suspicious external network calls or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Flask application managing load testing operations, with routes for controlling tests, exporting data, and viewing stats. It handles user input with typical Flask patterns, escaping outputs to prevent XSS, and serves files with correct headers. No signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or sabotage features are present. The use of 'json.loads' without validation is typical in such web interfaces, and no external network activity or backdoors are evident. The security risk is low, primarily due to minimal validation, but this is common in web UI code. Overall, the code appears legitimate, well-structured, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard Flask web UI for load testing management. It handles user input responsibly, provides necessary control and reporting features, and shows no signs of malicious or sabotage behavior. The low security risk score of 0.2 is justified given the context and implementation. No obfuscation or malware is detected.",
