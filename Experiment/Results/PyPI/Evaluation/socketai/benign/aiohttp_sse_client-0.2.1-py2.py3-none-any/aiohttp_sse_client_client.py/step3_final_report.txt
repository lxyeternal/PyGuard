{
  "purpose": "Implement a standard asynchronous Server-Sent Events (SSE) client using aiohttp, managing connection, event parsing, and reconnection logic.",
  "sources": "HTTP request to the specified URL, reading from response.content stream, processing SSE fields (event, data, id, retry).",
  "sinks": "User-defined callbacks (on_message, on_open, on_error) invoked with parsed MessageEvent objects; no untrusted data sinks in the code itself.",
  "flows": "HTTP request -> response stream -> line parsing -> event field processing -> MessageEvent creation -> callback invocation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard reconnection with exponential backoff; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation; reconnection delay doubles without upper limit but is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an SSE client, following standard patterns for connection management, event parsing, and error handling. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The reconnection logic employs exponential backoff, which is common, though it could benefit from an upper limit to prevent excessively long delays. The code does not contain obfuscated or hidden code, and all external interactions are via standard libraries and protocols. The user callbacks are external and could be a vector for malicious code if supplied maliciously, but this is outside the scope of the code itself. Overall, the code is well-structured, secure, and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate, standard implementation of an async SSE client with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent and justified based on the code analysis.",
