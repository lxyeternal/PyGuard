  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to identify any inconsistencies, potential issues, or signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard async SSE client, handling connections, events, errors, and reconnections responsibly. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code. The reconnection logic doubles delay without safeguards is typical, not malicious. No signs of data exfiltration or backdoors.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a standard SSE client with proper connection and event handling. No suspicious code or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard implementation of an SSE client with typical reconnection strategies, no malicious code, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is aligned with the code. The low risk score reflects the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Describes the code as a legitimate SSE client with proper handling, no signs of malicious activity, and standard practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** The analysis matches the code's structure and behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—standard SSE client, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** **Accurate and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code review:** The code is a typical, well-structured implementation of an async SSE client using aiohttp. It manages connection retries with exponential backoff, processes SSE events correctly, and invokes user-defined callbacks. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate. The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** The highest is 0.2 across reports, which is reasonable given the standard nature of the code and no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (low, standard reconnection logic, no secrets)\n\n**My personal estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.15 (a slightly conservative low risk, considering standard reconnection logic)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, well-implemented, and free from malicious or obfuscated content.",
