{
  "purpose": "Implements an asynchronous client for Server-Sent Events (SSE) using aiohttp, allowing connection, message handling, and reconnection logic.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration options during initialization, retrieves URL and headers for connections, and processes incoming event data from the response stream.",
  "sinks": "Processes incoming SSE data streams; no explicit sinks that handle untrusted data are evident beyond normal event processing.",
  "flows": "Connection request flows from connect() to receiving and processing streamed data; event data flows from response stream through _process_field() to _dispatch_event().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; reconnection logic uses exponential backoff, which is typical for such implementations; no obfuscated code present; standard library modules used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard SSE client with connection management, event parsing, and reconnection strategies. It does not include any suspicious or malicious code such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. The handling of incoming data appears aligned with SSE specifications. No hidden or obfuscated logic is detected. The code's flow is straightforward, with clear separation of concerns. There are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage in the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of an SSE client with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It follows standard patterns for network communication and event handling, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors observed.",
