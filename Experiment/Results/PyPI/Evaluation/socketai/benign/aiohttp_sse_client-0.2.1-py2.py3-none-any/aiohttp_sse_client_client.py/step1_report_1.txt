{
  "purpose": "Implement an asynchronous server-sent events (SSE) client that connects to a specified URL, handles incoming events, and manages reconnections.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from network responses via aiohttp, including response status, headers, and content streams; also reads configuration parameters from function arguments and class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Processes incoming network data, updates internal state, and invokes event handlers (on_open, on_message, on_error). No explicit data leaks or insecure handling are evident.",
  "flows": "Network request initiates from connect(), response content streams parsed in __anext__, event data processed and dispatched via _dispatch_event, with error handling and reconnection logic involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; code performs standard SSE client behavior with proper connection management. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected. Reconnection logic doubles delay without safeguards but is a common pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard async SSE client using aiohttp, with typical event parsing and reconnection logic. It handles connection errors, response validation, event dispatching, and reconnection delays responsibly. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network to external suspicious domains. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The code appears well-structured, and the logic aligns with typical usage patterns, with no suspicious anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard SSE client with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appropriately manages connections, events, and errors without engaging in any harmful or suspicious behavior.",
