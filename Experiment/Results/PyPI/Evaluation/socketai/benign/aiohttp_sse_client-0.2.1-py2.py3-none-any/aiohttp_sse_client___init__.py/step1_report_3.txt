  "flows": "No data flows identified; the code only declares metadata variables",
  "anomalies": "Absence of functional code; only metadata assignments with no executable logic",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of encoding declaration and package metadata variables, which are standard and benign. No input reading, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior are present. The minimal code structure indicates no potential attack vectors or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely metadata with no executable or malicious components. It poses no security risk or malware threat.",
