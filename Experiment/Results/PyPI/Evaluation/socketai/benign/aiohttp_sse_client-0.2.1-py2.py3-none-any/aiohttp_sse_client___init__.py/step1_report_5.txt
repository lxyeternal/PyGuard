  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials (beyond metadata), or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only package metadata definitions, including author, email, and version. It includes a UTF-8 encoding declaration and a docstring. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows. No dynamic code, input handling, or potentially malicious constructs are present. The content is standard for a package initialization file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package metadata declaration with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
