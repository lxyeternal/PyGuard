  "purpose": "This code serves as a package metadata header, providing author, email, version, and encoding information for the Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines static metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code contains only static variable assignments with no data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, containing only metadata declarations and a docstring.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static metadata header with no executable logic, input/output, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No suspicious signals or anomalies are present. The code's simplicity and static nature eliminate any threat or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package metadata header with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
