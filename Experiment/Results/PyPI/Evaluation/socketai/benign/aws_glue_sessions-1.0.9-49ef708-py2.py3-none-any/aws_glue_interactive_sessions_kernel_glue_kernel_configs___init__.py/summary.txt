  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is either absent, incomplete, or benign, with no indicators of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate, reflecting very low risk and malware potential. Minor adjustment in Report 2's security risk score from 0.2 to 0 enhances consistency, but overall, the evaluations are accurate and justified."
