  "purpose": "The code snippets are either absent, incomplete, or benign data processing scripts with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "In cases where code exists, sources include environment variables, user input, external files, or modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve system calls, network requests, or output to console or files, but no suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network or file outputs, but no malicious flows are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are observed; code is straightforward or absent.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the presence or absence of code. When code is incomplete or missing, scores reflect low confidence and minimal risk. No malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The reasoning is cautious and appropriate given the limited information. Slightly lowering the security risk score in Report 2 from 0.2 to 0 would better align with the lack of evidence, but overall, the scores are consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is either absent, incomplete, or benign, with no indicators of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate, reflecting very low risk and malware potential. Minor adjustment in Report 2's security risk score from 0.2 to 0 enhances consistency, but overall, the evaluations are accurate and justified.",
