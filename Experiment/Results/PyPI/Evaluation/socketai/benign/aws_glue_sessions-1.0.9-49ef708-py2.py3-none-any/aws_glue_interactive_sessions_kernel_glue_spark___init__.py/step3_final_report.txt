{
  "purpose": "To assess supply chain security risks of the open source Python dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security issues.",
  "sources": "Standard module imports, data processing functions, dynamic execution points, potential obfuscation segments.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, data leaks, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network, file system) via code execution or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code segments, dynamic execution, ambiguous data flows, potential hardcoded secrets, unusual variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code appears largely benign, with straightforward imports and data processing. Only Report 4 indicates obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion. The malware score of 0.3 in Report 4 is justified but could be slightly conservative; increasing it to 0.4 might better reflect the suspicion. Other reports show no suspicious activity, with scores appropriately low. Overall, the code's security risk remains low, with moderate suspicion in one case. The confidence levels are high for benign assessments and moderate for suspicious features.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with no malicious intent. Report 4's obfuscation and dynamic features warrant cautious scoring, but no confirmed malicious activity is present. Overall, the supply chain risk is low, with slight concern in specific segments.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.6,
