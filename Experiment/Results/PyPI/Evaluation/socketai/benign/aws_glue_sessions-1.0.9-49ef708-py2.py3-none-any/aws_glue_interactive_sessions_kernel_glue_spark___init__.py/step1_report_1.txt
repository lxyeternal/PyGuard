  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple demonstration or utility script, potentially for educational or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment variables, imports modules, and possibly reads input from user or external files if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, subprocess calls, or file writes, but none are explicitly present in the code provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or inputs through functions or modules, but no suspicious source-to-sink pathways are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are observed. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Step 1: The code imports standard modules without suspicious behavior. Step 2: No external data sources, network calls, or subprocesses are invoked. Step 3: No hardcoded secrets or credentials. Step 4: No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or misleading variables. Step 5: The code does not perform any dangerous or malicious actions; it appears benign. Overall, the code is simple and does not exhibit any malicious or security-threatening behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility or demonstration script with no suspicious behaviors.",
