  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, or data storage mechanisms if implemented, but none are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no visible source-to-sink data flows in the given code snippet, likely due to absence of code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are observable from the provided empty code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The provided input contains no actual code for review. Therefore, no code behaviors, data flows, or anomalies can be identified. The absence of code precludes any malicious behavior assessment.",
  "conclusion": "No code provided for review; thus, no malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation can be determined. The code appears empty or omitted.",
