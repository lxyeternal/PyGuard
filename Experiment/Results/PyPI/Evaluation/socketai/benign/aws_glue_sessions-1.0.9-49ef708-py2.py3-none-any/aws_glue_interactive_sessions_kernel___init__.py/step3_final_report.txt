{
  "purpose": "A simple AWS Lambda function that logs the input event and returns a static greeting message.",
  "sources": "The 'event' parameter, which is read and printed to logs.",
  "sinks": "The print statement, which outputs 'event' data to logs.",
  "flows": "Input 'event' flows from the function parameter to the print statement, then the function returns a static message.",
  "anomalies": "Logging 'event' data could potentially leak sensitive information if 'event' contains secrets or private data; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no external network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The only concern is that printing 'event' may expose sensitive data, which is a common logging practice but could be risky if logs are insecure. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate, reflecting the benign nature with a minor data leakage concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The slight security concern about logging sensitive data is acknowledged but does not constitute a security vulnerability. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
