  "purpose": "The function is designed to log an input event and return a greeting message.",
  "sources": "The 'event' parameter, which is input data to the function.",
  "sinks": "The 'print' statement outputs to the console; no direct sink for untrusted data leads to external effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'event' input to 'print' (logging), then the function returns a fixed message.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple AWS Lambda-style handler that logs its input and returns a static message. No external network calls, no data leakage, no malicious code or obfuscation. The use of 'print' is standard for debugging or logging, with no apparent malicious intent. The overall structure is clean and simple, with no anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign logging and response operation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
