{
  "purpose": "A simple function to print an event and return a greeting message",
  "sources": "The 'event' parameter, which is printed to the console",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs data to the standard output; no other sinks are present",
  "flows": "The 'event' data flows from the input parameter to the print statement, then the function returns a fixed message",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The print statement is a potential source for information leakage if event contains sensitive data, but this is context-dependent.",
  "analysis": "The function takes 'event' and 'context' as inputs, typical for serverless functions. It prints the 'event' data, which could potentially leak sensitive information if 'event' contains such data, but the code itself does not contain malicious logic. The return value is a static message. There are no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no external network calls, and no secret data handling beyond printing. Overall, this appears to be a benign example of a serverless function.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign serverless function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The only minor concern is that printing 'event' could inadvertently leak sensitive data, but this is not malicious code.",
