{
  "purpose": "A simple function that prints an input event and returns a greeting message.",
  "sources": "The 'event' parameter, which receives data from the caller or external source.",
  "sinks": "The 'print(event)' statement, which outputs data to the console or logs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'event' input to the 'print' function; no further data processing or external network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The function takes an input 'event' and logs it via print, then returns a static message. There are no external data fetches, no unsafe evaluations, and no sensitive data handling. The simplicity and lack of data manipulation or external communication indicate no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign operation of logging input and returning a greeting. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks.",
