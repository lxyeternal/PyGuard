{
  "purpose": "A simple AWS Lambda function that prints the input event and returns a greeting message.",
  "sources": "The 'event' parameter passed into the function.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs data to logs, which could potentially leak information if logs are insecure.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'event' parameter into the print statement, then the function returns a static message.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and does not include suspicious or complex constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a basic function that logs the received event data and returns a fixed message. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The print statement could expose sensitive information if event data contains secrets, but this is typical in debugging. Overall, the code is simple and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, a standard hello-world Lambda function with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
