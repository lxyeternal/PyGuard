  "purpose": "A simple function that prints an input event and returns a greeting message",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'event' which may contain external data",
  "sinks": "The print statement which outputs the event data to standard output",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'event' into the print statement, then the function returns a fixed message",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The function performs a straightforward print and return operation.",
  "analysis": "The function accepts an 'event' input, prints it, and returns a static message. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code execution, or network activity. The use of 'print' is benign, serving likely for debugging or logging. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic hello-world style function with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
