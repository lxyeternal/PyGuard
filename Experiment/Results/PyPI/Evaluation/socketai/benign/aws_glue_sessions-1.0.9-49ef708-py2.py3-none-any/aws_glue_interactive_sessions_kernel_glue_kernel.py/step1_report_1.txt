{
  "purpose": "The script automates the installation of Jupyter kernel specifications for AWS Glue PySpark and Spark kernels, providing instructions and handling errors.",
  "sources": "Input source is the __file__ path for locating kernel spec files; no untrusted user input or external data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the 'install_kernel_spec' function which installs kernel specs from local paths; no untrusted data is directly written or transmitted outside the environment.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling 'do_install', which sequentially installs kernel specs from local paths, with exception handling that displays a markdown error message if installation fails.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets or credentials. The code primarily performs filesystem operations and uses established Jupyter API functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines an error message. It sets up a CLI with 'click', defining an 'install' command that triggers 'do_install'. 'do_install' calls 'do_install_kernel_spec' for two kernels, which installs kernel specs from local directories determined relative to the script's location. Exception handling displays a static markdown message. No user input, network communication, or obfuscated/malicious logic is present. The code appears standard for a package installation script with error messaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward installation script for Jupyter kernels, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly performs filesystem-based kernel installation and error reporting, with no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
