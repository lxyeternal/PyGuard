  "purpose": "Install Jupyter kernel specifications for AWS Glue PySpark and Spark kernels from local directories relative to the script.",
  "sources": "Reads the script's directory via __file__, and calls install_kernel_spec with constructed paths.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem operations installing kernel specs; no untrusted data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Determines path from __file__, then calls install_kernel_spec with that path.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; straightforward filesystem and API calls; no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple installer script that uses standard libraries and APIs to install Jupyter kernels from local paths. It handles errors by printing static instructions. No external input, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The reliance on __file__ for path derivation is typical and safe in standard environments. No obfuscation or secrets are involved. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The minimal risk stems from environment trust assumptions, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for installing Jupyter kernels, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified and accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
