  "purpose": "Subclassing and overriding a configuration retrieval class to provide custom configuration values.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'overridden_configs' object provided during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The 'getattr' function retrieves attributes from 'overridden_configs', potentially exposing sensitive data if misused.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'overridden_configs' to 'getattr', which returns attribute values based on 'config_name'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated logic present. The code simply provides a way to override configurations.",
  "analysis": "The class 'OverriddenConfigRetriever' extends 'ConfigRetriever' and allows dynamic configuration overrides via an object passed at instantiation. The 'get_config_variable' method uses 'getattr' to retrieve attribute values by name, which is a standard pattern for configuration management. No suspicious data handling, external network operations, or malicious intent is observed. The code appears to be a controlled override mechanism without hidden malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward extension of a configuration retriever allowing for override configurations. It contains no malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
