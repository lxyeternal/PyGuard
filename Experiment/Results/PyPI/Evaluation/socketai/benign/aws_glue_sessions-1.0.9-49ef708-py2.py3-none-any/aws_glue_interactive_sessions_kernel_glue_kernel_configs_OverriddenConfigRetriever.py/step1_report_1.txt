  "purpose": "A class that overrides configuration retrieval from a specified object",
  "sources": "Initialization with overridden_configs, method get_config_variable accessing attributes",
  "sinks": "getattr on overridden_configs, returning configuration values",
  "flows": "overridden_configs -> get_config_variable -> getattr",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns; simple attribute access",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of ConfigRetriever, adding functionality to retrieve configuration variables from a provided object. It uses standard Python features without dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious operations. No sensitive data handling, external network operations, or credential management are present. The code appears to be a straightforward extension designed for flexible configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a configuration wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
