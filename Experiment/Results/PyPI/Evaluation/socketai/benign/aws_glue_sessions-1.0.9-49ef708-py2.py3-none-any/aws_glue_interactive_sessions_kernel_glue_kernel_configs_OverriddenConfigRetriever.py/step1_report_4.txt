  "purpose": "Custom class overriding a configuration retrieval method for AWS Glue interactive sessions.",
  "sources": "The 'overridden_configs' object passed to the constructor, which supplies configuration values.",
  "sinks": "The 'getattr' function call retrieves attributes from 'overridden_configs'; no untrusted data sinks are directly present.",
  "flows": "Input 'overridden_configs' flows into 'getattr', which accesses attributes based on 'config_name' argument.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code simply extends a class and overrides a method.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of 'ConfigRetriever' that stores an 'overridden_configs' object. The 'get_config_variable' method retrieves an attribute from this object using 'getattr'. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. Usage of 'getattr' is standard for dynamic attribute access. The code appears safe and straightforward, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple subclass extension for configuration management, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It securely retrieves configuration variables from a provided object, with no evident security concerns.",
