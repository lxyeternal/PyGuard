  "purpose": "A configuration retrieval class that extends an existing ConfigRetriever to override configuration variables from a provided object.",
  "sources": "The method get_config_variable reads the attribute named config_name from the overridden_configs object.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data into sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "Input: config_name (used as attribute name); Flow: getattr retrieves attribute from overridden_configs; Output: returns the attribute value.",
  "anomalies": "Use of getattr with external input could lead to attribute errors if config_name is untrusted, but no malicious intent or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass that retrieves configuration values dynamically from an object. It uses standard Python features without obfuscation or malicious patterns. The only potential concern is reliance on external input for attribute names, which could cause errors but not malicious activity. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is ensuring that config_name is controlled or validated if used with untrusted input. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk.",
