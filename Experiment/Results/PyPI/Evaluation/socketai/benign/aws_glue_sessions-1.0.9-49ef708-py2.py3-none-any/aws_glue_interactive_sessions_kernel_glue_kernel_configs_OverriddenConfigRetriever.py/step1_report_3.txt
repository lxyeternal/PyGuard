{
  "purpose": "A class that overrides configuration retrieval behavior by returning values from a provided object.",
  "sources": "Input data is from the 'overridden_configs' object passed during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The method 'get_config_variable' accesses attributes dynamically; potential risks depend on the source of 'overridden_configs' data.",
  "flows": "The code flows from initialization with 'overridden_configs' to dynamic attribute access via 'getattr' in 'get_config_variable'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The class inherits from 'ConfigRetriever' and overrides behavior to fetch configuration variables dynamically from 'overridden_configs'. The use of 'getattr' is standard for dynamic attribute access. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The code's security risk mainly depends on the source of 'overridden_configs', which is external to this snippet. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward override of a configuration retrieval method with no malicious intent or security issues based on the provided code. Its safety relies on the integrity of the 'overridden_configs' object provided during instantiation.",
