  "purpose": "Configuration class for a Scala-based AWS Glue kernel, setting session and language parameters.",
  "sources": "Imports of constants and base classes, attribute assignments, and the kernel launch in main.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Initialization and attribute setting without external data flow or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class definition configuring a Jupyter kernel for AWS Glue with Scala. It involves setting metadata, session parameters, and launching the kernel. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code is static, with no network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The minimal risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; they could be lowered further to zero given the benign nature. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns support a conclusion of no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration class for a Scala AWS Glue kernel, with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
