  "purpose": "Define a Scala-based kernel class for AWS Glue sessions within an interactive environment.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (aws_glue_interactive_sessions_kernel.glue_kernel_utils, ..glue_kernel_base), class attributes, and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Setting attributes on 'self.overrides', calling super().__init__, and IPKernelApp.launch_instance.",
  "flows": "Initialization of class attributes, setting session type, and launching the kernel instance.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code primarily sets configurations and inherits behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class 'GlueKernel' that extends 'BaseKernel', configuring session and language settings for an AWS Glue Scala session. It imports constants and base classes, sets kernel metadata, and provides methods to set default arguments and session type. The '__main__' block launches an IPython kernel instance with this class. No user input handling, network communication, or data leaks are present. There are no obfuscated or malicious code patterns. The code appears to be standard configuration and class setup for a kernel environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard class definition for a Scala-based AWS Glue kernel, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily sets configuration parameters and launches a kernel instance, with no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
