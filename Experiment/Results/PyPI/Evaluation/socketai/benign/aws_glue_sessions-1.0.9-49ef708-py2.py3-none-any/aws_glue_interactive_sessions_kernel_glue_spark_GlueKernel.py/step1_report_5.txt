{
  "purpose": "Defines a Scala-based Glue Kernel class for AWS Glue sessions, including configuration methods and kernel setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements for constants and base classes; class attributes and methods; __main__ block initiating kernel launch.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data flows to external systems, network, or file writes; no untrusted input handling observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization and configuration methods set class attributes; no data flows to external sinks or network.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. Use of placeholder or no-op methods like 'set_python_version' does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward class definition for a Scala-based kernel, extending a base class and setting configuration attributes. It imports constants, defines class attributes, and provides methods to set default arguments and session type. The main block launches the kernel instance. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, malicious code, or suspicious network activity. The code structure is clear, with no obfuscation or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical kernel configuration script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It simply sets up a Scala session kernel with predefined parameters. No indicators of malware, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
