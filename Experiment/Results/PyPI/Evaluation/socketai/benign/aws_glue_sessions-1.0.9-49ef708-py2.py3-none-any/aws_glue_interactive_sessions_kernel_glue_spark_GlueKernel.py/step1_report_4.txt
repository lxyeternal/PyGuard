  "purpose": "Define a custom Spark Kernel class for AWS Glue sessions with specific configurations.",
  "sources": "Import statements for constants and base classes; class attribute assignments; methods setting default arguments and session type.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No data output, network communication, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; methods mainly set internal state or constants.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors detected. The class appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of BaseKernel, setting properties related to Scala and AWS Glue. It includes a method to set default arguments and a method to set session type, both of which manipulate class attributes. The main block launches a kernel instance. No external data inputs, network operations, or obfuscated logic are present. The code appears to serve as configuration/setup for a Spark kernel, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard class definition for configuring a Spark kernel for AWS Glue with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be safe, intended for setting up kernel parameters.",
