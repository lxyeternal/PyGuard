  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks, no data leaks, or untrusted data effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the script only calls setup().",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from setuptools and executes it immediately, which is typical for a minimal setup script. It does not contain any external data input, network operations, or malicious constructs. There are no signs of obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or malicious intent. The script appears to be a standard, benign setup configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
