{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging, importing annotations from __future__ and calling setup() with default parameters.",
  "sources": "No external input, data, or environment variables; only static imports and function call.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; code executes setup() with no parameters, no data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard setup script used in Python packaging. It imports a future feature for annotations and calls setup() without arguments, relying on configuration files or defaults. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The code does not perform any network activity, data processing, or dynamic execution. The simplicity and lack of external data or code execution points to a benign purpose. All signals, including the absence of suspicious patterns, support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign Python setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
