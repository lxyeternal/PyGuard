{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The import statement from __future__ import annotations, and the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "The code imports a feature from __future__, then executes setup() which generally reads package metadata. No untrusted data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The use of __future__ import is standard, and setup() is a typical call in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a __future__ import to enable annotations, followed by a call to setuptools.setup(). This is a common, benign pattern for Python package setup scripts. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are detected. The code does not include any malicious network activity, code injection, or obfuscated components.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
