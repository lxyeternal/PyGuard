{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function call, which may read configuration data if provided (though none is here).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks present in this minimal code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code simply invokes setup(), no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The import from __future__ is standard for compatibility; no anomalies or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__ features, likely for compatibility, then calls setup() with default parameters. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior. The setup() function is used for package configuration, which is standard in Python packaging workflows. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
