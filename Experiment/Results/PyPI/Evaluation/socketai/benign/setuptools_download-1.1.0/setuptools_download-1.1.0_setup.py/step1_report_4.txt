{
  "purpose": "The code is used to set up and configure a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from __future__ import annotations' and the 'setup()' function call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "The future import influences type annotations parsing; setup() executes package setup without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup with minimal complexity. The future import is benign and used for forward compatibility. The setup() function is called directly without additional parameters or dynamic code. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
