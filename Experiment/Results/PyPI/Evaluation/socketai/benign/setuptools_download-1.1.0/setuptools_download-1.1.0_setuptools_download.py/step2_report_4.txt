  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the logic, code behavior, and scoring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles downloading, extracting, filtering, and installing files for dependencies. No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, checksum verification is used properly, environment markers are straightforward.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 (low). The confidence is high (0.9).\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The code's purpose aligns with standard dependency management.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The risk score of 0.2 seems appropriate, considering potential external URL risks but no direct malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on dependency management, checksum validation, environment filtering, and standard network operations.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. Confidence high.\n\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No malicious intent detected. The low risk score is justified given the standard operations.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focused on dependency downloading, extraction, checksum verification, and installation. No signs of malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The only concern is reliance on external URLs, but that's inherent in dependency management, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, standard dependency handling, safe extraction, checksum validation, no obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—secure download, validation, extraction, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2.\n\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the code's behavior—no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero, mostly reflecting the potential risk of malicious URLs or compromised dependencies, which cannot be fully assessed without inspecting actual URLs.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured utility for dependency management, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n- The scores are consistent across reports and justified given the static analysis.\n\n- The low security risk scores are appropriate, considering the external URL dependencies, but no direct malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious code detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is transparent.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — acknowledging external dependencies and potential URL risks, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments needed.",
