  "purpose": "Provides utilities for managing environment variables within context managers, including setting, unsetting, and cleaning environment variables for testing and subprocess control.",
  "sources": "Environment variables accessed via os.environ, sys.path for Python paths.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables modified or deleted; potential manipulation of environment for subprocesses or testing.",
  "flows": "Reading environment variables (sources) and modifying them (sinks) within context managers. No external data flows or user input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The code only manipulates environment variables for testing and environment setup.",
  "analysis": "The code provides multiple context managers for environment variable manipulation, including setting, unsetting, and temporarily removing variables. It includes utility functions for cleaning and setting PYTHONPATH. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful actions. The environment manipulations are controlled and used for testing or subprocess configuration. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for environment management with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It facilitates testing and environment configuration, which are common in development workflows.",
