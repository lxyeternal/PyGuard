  "purpose": "Provides utilities for managing environment variables during testing and runtime, such as setting, unsetting, and temporarily modifying environment variables.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables (os.environ) and function arguments for environment modifications.",
  "sinks": "Modifications to os.environ, which affect process environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input from function arguments or existing environment variables → environment variable updates or deletions in os.environ.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears standard for environment management with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of environment variables is controlled and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code provides context managers for environment variable manipulation: setting specific variables, unsetting variables, and ensuring variables are absent. It includes functions to get a sanitized environment (excluding PYTHONPATH) and to create an environment with PYTHONPATH set to sys.path. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. The code handles environment state safely and restores original state after modifications. No external data leaks, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, standard environment management utilities without malicious intent or security risks. It handles environment variables securely and predictably, suitable for testing and runtime modifications.",
