  "purpose": "Utilities for managing environment variables within Python scripts, including setting, unsetting, and restoring environment variables for testing or subprocess execution.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via os.environ, sys.path, and input arguments to functions such as set_env, unset_env, no_env, get_clean_python_env, and get_env_with_pythonpath.",
  "sinks": "Modifying os.environ directly, including deletion, updating, and clearing environment variables. Potentially dangerous if untrusted data influences environment variables in a malicious context.",
  "flows": "Input arguments or environment variables influence os.environ via functions like set_env and unset_env, which modify environment state. get_env_with_pythonpath constructs environment variables with data from sys.path, potentially influenced by external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward utility functions with no suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The functions do not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. Use of functools.partial is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code provides mechanisms to modify environment variables temporarily, primarily for testing or subprocess management. It carefully restores environment state after modifications, reducing risk of persistent malicious changes. No external data sources or sinks suggest malicious intent. No suspicious behavior such as network calls, file operations, or credential management. The functions are general-purpose environment utilities and do not contain or execute untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of environment management utilities with no indications of malicious behavior or malware. It could, if misused externally, influence environment variables in a way that might facilitate malicious activities, but the code itself is benign. No malware or security risks identified.",
