  "purpose": "Utilities for managing environment variables during runtime, including setting, unsetting, and retrieving environment configurations for testing and subprocess management.",
  "sources": "Environment variables read via os.environ; sys.path used to construct PYTHONPATH; function arguments and context managers that modify environment state.",
  "sinks": "Modifications to os.environ which can affect subprocesses or external programs; updates to PYTHONPATH which influence module import behavior; environment restoration after context managers.",
  "flows": "Functions modify os.environ directly, with context managers saving/restoring environment states; get_env_with_pythonpath creates environment dict with current sys.path as PYTHONPATH; get_clean_python_env strips PYTHONPATH from environment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present; use of environment manipulation is standard for testing utilities, not malicious activity. No obfuscated code or suspicious external calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard environment management utilities, including context managers for temporarily setting, unsetting, or asserting absence of environment variables, and functions for retrieving environment states. All modifications are confined within context managers, with proper save and restore mechanisms. No external network calls, no credential theft, or malicious system modifications are present. The code appears to be a safe utility module for environment handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for environment variable management, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions or leak sensitive data. The implementation is standard and appropriate for its purpose.",
