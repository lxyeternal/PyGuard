  "purpose": "Utilities for managing environment variables during testing and runtime, including setting, unsetting, and asserting environment states.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment variables via os.environ, sys.path, and input parameters for context managers and functions.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables are modified or temporarily overridden; no external data sinks or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variable access or sys.path; Sink: environment modifications within context managers, restoring original state after use.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward environment management functions with proper save/restore mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard, well-structured utilities for environment variable manipulation, including context managers for setting, unsetting, and asserting absence of variables. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious modifications. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are present. The functions are commonly used in testing and runtime configuration, with proper handling to prevent persistent changes. The potential for misuse exists if external code manipulates environment variables maliciously, but this is external to the code's intent and implementation. Overall, the code is benign, safe, and aligns with best practices for environment management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard, benign environment utilities with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only minor concern is potential external misuse, which justifies a small security risk score but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
