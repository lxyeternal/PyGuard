{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for command-line tools, including environment management, user prompts, temporary directory handling, and system path lookups.",
  "sources": "Reads user input via raw_input/getpass, accesses environment variables, reads/writes files, and system paths.",
  "sinks": "System calls (os.chdir, os.umask), filesystem operations (shutil, os.listdir), environment variable access, print statements, and subprocess interactions.",
  "flows": "User input and environment variables influence filesystem and system operations; prompts and environment info are displayed via print/logging.",
  "anomalies": "Use of deprecated raw_input (Python 2), minimal info leakage via print statements, no input sanitization, exception handling may mask issues.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of standard CLI utility functions with no malicious payloads, network activity, or obfuscation. The use of legacy functions like raw_input indicates compatibility with older Python versions but does not introduce security risks. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The environment variable manipulations and filesystem operations are typical and benign. The code's structure and purpose suggest it is intended for safe system utility tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate, mainly reflecting minor legacy concerns. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. Overall, the code is safe for use, and the scores are justified.",
