  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is appropriate, mainly reflecting minor legacy concerns. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. Overall, the code is safe for use, and the scores are justified."
