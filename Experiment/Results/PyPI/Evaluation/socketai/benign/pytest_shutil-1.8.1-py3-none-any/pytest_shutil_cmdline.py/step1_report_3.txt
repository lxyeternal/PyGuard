{
  "purpose": "This module provides various utility functions and classes for command-line tools, including context managers, input prompts, file operations, and environment handling.",
  "sources": "Input prompts (request_username, request_password, wait_for_user_confirmation), environment variables (PATHEXT, PATH), file system (os.environ, os.path, os.listdir, os.getcwd), stdin for getch",
  "sinks": "os.system, os.chdir, shutil.copy, shutil.rmtree, print statements, getpass.getpass, os.environ, os.access, os.listdir, os.path functions",
  "flows": "Input prompts and environment variables are used to influence flow; get_real_python_executable uses filesystem info; getch captures keyboard input; copy_files reads source directory and copies files to destination",
  "anomalies": "Use of raw_input (Python 2) and print statements suggest legacy code; no hardcoded secrets; environment variables used to locate executables; no suspicious code manipulation or obfuscation; exception handling appears standard",
  "analysis": "The code provides standard utility functions for command-line operations, temporary directory management, file copying, and user input prompts. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The getch classes abstract platform-specific input handling. Environment variables are used in the 'which' function and in locating Python executables, which is normal. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity is detected. The code does not perform any operations that could compromise security intentionally.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of legitimate utility functions for CLI tools, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles file and environment operations securely, with no embedded malware or backdoors. Overall, it appears to be safe and intended for general use.",
