  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for command-line tools, including context managers, input prompts, temporary directory management, and system command lookups.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.environ), user input functions (raw_input, getpass), file system operations (os.listdir, os.path), system commands (sys.executable), and standard input (sys.stdin).",
  "sinks": "os.system calls, os.chmod, shutil.copy, shutil.rmtree, os.chdir, os.umask, and printing to stdout, which can potentially execute or reveal sensitive data if misused.",
  "flows": "Input prompts (request_username, request_password, wait_for_user_confirmation) feed into local variables; environment variables influence behavior in which() and get_real_python_executable; file system functions read and write files/directories; system functions execute commands or access system paths.",
  "anomalies": "Use of raw_input (Python 2) for username prompt, which could be unsafe if input is untrusted; environment variable PATHEXT is used for executable path extension matching; potentially unnecessary environment modification in PrettyFormatter (setting FORCE_COLOR); no explicit sanitization of user input; exception handling in TempDir may mask filesystem issues; printing diagnostic info about Python executable location could leak system details.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of utility functions for managing directories, input, and environment interactions, with no evident obfuscated code or payloads. Use of raw_input suggests code is compatible with Python 2, but does not introduce malicious behavior. Functions like 'which' and 'get_real_python_executable' perform system path lookups, which are typical system utilities. No network connections, data exfiltration, or suspicious command executions are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic observed. The overall structure appears safe, with no malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of system utility functions intended for command-line applications. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior; it performs typical system and environment operations safely. Minor concerns relate to use of raw_input and potential information leakage through print statements, but these are standard and not malicious. Overall security risk is low.",
