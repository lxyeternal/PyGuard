  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, network addresses, file operations, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file I/O, environment variable access, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network addresses flow into data processing or transmission functions; dynamic execution may process untrusted code leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), suspicious network addresses, hardcoded strings, suppression of exceptions, unusual import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits varying levels of suspicion. Benign scripts are straightforward with no obfuscation or suspicious activity, reflected in low malware and risk scores. Suspicious scripts show obfuscation, dynamic execution, and network activity, indicating potential malicious intent. Scores are generally aligned with the described behaviors, with minor room for adjustment based on further evidence. The most suspicious reports (2 and 5) display signs consistent with malicious activity, warranting slightly higher malware and risk scores. Benign or empty code reports are correctly scored with minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with appropriate low scores. Reports indicating obfuscation, dynamic execution, and network activity show signs of potential malicious behavior, justified by higher scores. Slightly increasing malware and risk scores for the most suspicious reports (2 and 5) to reflect their indicators would improve accuracy. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified based on the evidence.",
