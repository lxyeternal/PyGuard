  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with appropriate low scores. Reports indicating obfuscation, dynamic execution, and network activity show signs of potential malicious behavior, justified by higher scores. Slightly increasing malware and risk scores for the most suspicious reports (2 and 5) to reflect their indicators would improve accuracy. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified based on the evidence."
