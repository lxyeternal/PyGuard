  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly clear due to lack of comments or documentation. It appears to be a simple Python script, potentially for data processing or utility functions, but no specific intent is evident.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from variables, function parameters, or possibly external inputs (such as environment variables or user input if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network operations, or file writes, depending on the functions used. No explicit dangerous sinks are evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through various functions or processing steps, with no evidence of data being sent to external systems or used maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are apparent. The code is straightforward and follows standard syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and appears to be a standard Python script with no suspicious imports, no dynamic execution, and no obvious malicious patterns. Without additional context or more code, no malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The lack of comments or documentation limits full understanding, but nothing in the visible code indicates malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code seems benign, with no hardcoded secrets, unusual data flows, or suspicious activity. Confidence in this assessment is high given the limited and straightforward nature of the code.",
