  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a module or script that performs some form of data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Data is read from standard input, environment variables, or external modules. No explicit user input or external data sources are clearly identifiable.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution functions. However, none are explicitly present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "The code does not show any source-to-sink data flow; it mostly consists of definitions and function calls that do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code does not exhibit obfuscated or unusual language features. No malicious comments or unusual variable naming are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting of standard function definitions, class declarations, and typical Python syntax. No external libraries are misused or invoke dangerous operations. There are no indications of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The absence of network activity, system modifications, or obfuscated segments reduces suspicion. The overall structure and content do not suggest malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. The code appears benign and standard in nature.",
