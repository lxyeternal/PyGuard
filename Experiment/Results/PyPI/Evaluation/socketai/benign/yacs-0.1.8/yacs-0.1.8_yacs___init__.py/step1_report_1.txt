  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific task, but the actual intent is unclear without examining the code.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, configuration files, or external network requests.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through network transmission, file writing, or logging; unsafe execution of dynamic code.",
  "flows": "Data received from sources may flow into sensitive functions such as network send, file write, or eval/exec statements.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, unused imports, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious network addresses; unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code should be reviewed for key points such as input sources, data flow to sinks, and any suspicious or obfuscated segments. Without actual code provided, the review focuses on checking for typical malicious indicators such as hardcoded secrets, insecure data handling, or suspicious network activity. The structure and format of the code need to be examined for obfuscation or anomalies. Since the code is not visible in this prompt, this analysis remains general. If code contained functions like eval, exec, or network connections to suspicious domains, these would raise concern. The absence of these details limits definitive conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, there are no explicit signs of malicious behavior, but the lack of visible code prevents a thorough assessment. The overall security risk appears low, assuming standard code practices.",
