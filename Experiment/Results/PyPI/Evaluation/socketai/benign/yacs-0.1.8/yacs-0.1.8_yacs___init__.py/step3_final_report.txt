  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, data input points, network connections, environment variables, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file system modifications, environment variable access, data leaks, system commands.",
  "flows": "From data sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, file system, system commands).",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual data flows, backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code, relying on descriptions. They correctly assign low confidence scores due to limited visibility. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity are indicated. Malware scores are zero, and security risks are minimal. The assessments are consistent with the evidence, and the scores reflect the limited information. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign based on the provided summaries. All reports' scores are justified and consistent with their reasoning. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks is present. The overall security posture is low risk, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and a low risk score (~0.2).",
