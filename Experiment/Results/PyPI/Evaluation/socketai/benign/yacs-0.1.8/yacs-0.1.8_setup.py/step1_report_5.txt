  "purpose": "Define and configure the Python package 'yacs' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Code reads static package metadata (name, version, author info, description, URL, classifiers, dependencies).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input; no potential data leaks or harmful actions are evident.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is present; configuration is static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code uses standard setuptools setup with no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, importing 'setuptools' and calling 'setup' with static metadata. All data is hardcoded and there are no functions or dynamic operations that could be malicious. There are no signs of code injection, data leaks, or other security issues. No suspicious behavior or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical package setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns. It merely defines package metadata for distribution.",
