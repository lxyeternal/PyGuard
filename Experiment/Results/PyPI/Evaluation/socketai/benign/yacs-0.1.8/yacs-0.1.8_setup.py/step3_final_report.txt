  "purpose": "Standard package setup configuration for the 'yacs' Python library.",
  "sources": "Static metadata fields such as name, version, author, description, dependencies, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, user input, or runtime data processing.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script importing setuptools and calling setup() with hardcoded, static package metadata. It contains no dynamic code, user input handling, network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code. All reports correctly identify it as a benign, static configuration. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and static nature justify high confidence in its benign status.",
  "conclusion": "The setup.py script is a standard, benign package configuration with no malicious or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No further modifications are necessary.",
