{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for the Python package 'yacs', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Setup parameters such as 'name', 'version', 'author', 'author_email', 'description', 'url', 'packages', 'long_description', 'classifiers', and 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as setup() configurations do not directly process untrusted data during runtime; they are static configuration parameters.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only provides static package metadata without runtime data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard setuptools setup without unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls it with static package metadata, including author info, description, URL, dependencies, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity occurs. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code behavior. All parameters appear standard for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
