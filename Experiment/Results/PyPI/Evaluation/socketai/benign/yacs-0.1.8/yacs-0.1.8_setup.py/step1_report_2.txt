  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'yacs' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs or untrusted data; it only defines static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or execute code based on external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to critical functions; the setup process is static and deterministic.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated sections; the code is standard package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code uses setuptools to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. It contains no dynamic code execution, no reading of external inputs, nor any suspicious or malicious logic. All fields are static and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
