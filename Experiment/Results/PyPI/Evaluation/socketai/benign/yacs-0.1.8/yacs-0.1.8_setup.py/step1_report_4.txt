{
  "purpose": "To define and configure the setup for the Python package 'yacs' for distribution.",
  "sources": "Input data from package metadata (name, version, author info, description, URL, dependencies).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; the code primarily sets up package metadata without executing untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is declarative setup configuration, not a runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code is standard setup.py content; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' to configure the package. It specifies package metadata such as name, version, author, description, URL, and dependencies. The 'install_requires' field lists 'PyYAML', a common dependency. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data leaks. The code appears to be a standard, benign setup configuration for packaging a Python project.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It solely defines package metadata and dependencies.",
