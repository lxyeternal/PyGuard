  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the Python package 'yacs' including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from the script itself (package info, dependencies).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All data are static strings and lists. No dynamic code execution, no input processing, and no network activity. The dependencies are standard (PyYAML) and the package info appears normal. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
