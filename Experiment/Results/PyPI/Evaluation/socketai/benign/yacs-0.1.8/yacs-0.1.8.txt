      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-tested configuration management system with no malicious intent. The primary security consideration is the handling of untrusted YAML files with custom tags, which can pose a deserialization risk but is not an active threat in this context. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate configuration management system with a known security risk associated with dynamic code execution during module import. No malicious code or backdoors are detected. The scores should reflect a low to moderate risk, emphasizing the importance of trusting source files. Overall, the code is safe if used with verified sources, but caution is advised to prevent supply chain issues."
