  "purpose": "Unit testing class for MultiMapping functionality in Python.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'unittest', internal method calls, class and function definitions, and imports of external classes 'MultiMapping' and 'ExtensionClass'.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A; test code runs in a controlled environment, no external data or untrusted inputs involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or external network interactions observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test suite for the 'MultiMapping' class, testing typical dictionary-like behaviors. The imports suggest dependencies on external modules 'MultiMapping' and 'ExtensionClass', but no malicious or suspicious activity is evident. There are no input sources, external data flows, or potentially dangerous operations. The code appears to be legitimate test code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical unit test for a data structure, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It solely verifies expected behaviors of the 'MultiMapping' class.",
