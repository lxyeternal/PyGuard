{
  "purpose": "Implements a multi-layered mapping class allowing layered dictionary lookups and modifications.",
  "sources": "Input data can originate from the list of dictionaries passed during initialization and the dictionaries added via push method.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if external dictionaries contain sensitive information, but no direct leakage or external output is shown in this code.",
  "flows": "Input dictionaries are stored in __dicts__; lookups traverse these dictionaries in reverse order; push and pop modify __dicts__; length sums the size of all dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The class provides layered dictionary behavior with methods for access, modification, and containment checks. It uses list of dictionaries to allow stacking and dynamic modification. No external data sources or network operations are present. The code appears standard and straightforward without malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a layered dictionary structure with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a multi-dictionary container with standard methods. No malicious activity or security issues are evident.",
