  "purpose": "Implements a layered dictionary utility class allowing multiple dictionaries to be managed with push/pop operations and layered access.",
  "sources": "External dictionaries passed during initialization and added via push method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data leaks; code operates entirely in-memory.",
  "flows": "Accessing a key searches through the list of dictionaries in reverse order; push adds a dictionary to the list; pop removes one.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward. The __getitem__ method traverses dictionaries in reverse, which is standard for layered lookup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, benign layered dictionary container with standard methods. No external I/O, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as a utility class with no malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with its behavior. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present. The class relies on external dictionaries; if any are malicious, they could introduce security issues outside this code's scope, but this is typical for such data structures. Overall, the code is safe, straightforward, and free of security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard layered dictionary utility with no malicious or security issues. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
