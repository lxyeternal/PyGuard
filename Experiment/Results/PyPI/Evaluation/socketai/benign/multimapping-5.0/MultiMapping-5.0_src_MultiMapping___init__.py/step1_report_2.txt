{
  "purpose": "Implements a multi-dictionary class that allows layered key-value mappings with dynamic push and pop capabilities.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the provided dictionaries during initialization and through __getitem__, get, and __contains__ methods.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks; no untrusted data output or external communication functions present.",
  "flows": "Input dictionaries are stored internally; data retrieval flows from these dictionaries via overridden __getitem__, get, and __contains__ methods.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The class is a straightforward implementation of layered dictionaries, allowing push and pop operations for dynamic management. It uses standard exception handling for missing keys. No network, file, or external system interactions are present. The code does not contain hidden or suspicious behavior. It solely manages in-memory data structures with common Python idioms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data structure implementation with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious behaviors.",
