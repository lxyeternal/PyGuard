{
  "purpose": "Defines a MultiMapping class that aggregates multiple dictionaries, allowing layered key-value access, modification, and management.",
  "sources": "Input data is primarily the dictionaries passed during initialization or added via the push method.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data or external outputs; no I/O operations or network interactions present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the stored dictionaries (__dicts__) through getitem, get, and __contains__ methods; no external data flow or output is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Uses __slots__ for memory optimization, which is benign. The class methods behave as expected for a dictionary-like structure. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a composite dictionary structure with layered access, using list of dicts. Methods like __getitem__, get, and __contains__ follow standard patterns. No external network, file I/O, or data exfiltration activities are present. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or secret handling observed. The code appears to serve as a utility data structure with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard layered dictionary utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and benign.",
