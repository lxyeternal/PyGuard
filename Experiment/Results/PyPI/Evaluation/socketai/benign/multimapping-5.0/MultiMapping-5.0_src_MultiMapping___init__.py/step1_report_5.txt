{
  "purpose": "Define a multi-dictionary class that allows layered access and modification of multiple dictionary-like objects.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the __init__ method arguments and potentially external dictionary objects added via push().",
  "sinks": "Access to dictionaries via __getitem__, get, __contains__, and push/pop methods, which operate on external dictionaries passed by reference.",
  "flows": "Input dictionaries are stored in __dicts__; get and __getitem__ access these dictionaries; push adds new dictionaries; pop removes dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code simply manages collections of dictionaries with no network or I/O operations.",
  "analysis": "The class MultiMapping provides layered dictionary-like behavior, allowing retrieval and management of multiple dictionaries. It iterates over stored dicts in reverse for lookups, which is standard. The methods are straightforward and do not perform any network, file, or system operations. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is typical for a multi-layered mapping utility. No obfuscation or unusual language features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a layered dictionary class with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be safe and intended solely for managing multiple dictionary objects in a layered manner.",
