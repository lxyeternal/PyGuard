  "purpose": "Setup script for the MultiMapping Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and distribution details.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.txt and CHANGES.txt files for long_description.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data processing or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "Reading files for description and passing static data to setup(), no flow of untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated logic.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks for a Python package using setuptools. It reads local files for descriptions, defines package metadata, and specifies dependencies. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network communication, or handling of untrusted input. The files read are static documentation files, and no other potentially malicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
