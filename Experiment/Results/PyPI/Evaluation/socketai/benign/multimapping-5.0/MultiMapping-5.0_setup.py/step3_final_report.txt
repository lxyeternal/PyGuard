  "purpose": "Define package metadata, dependencies, and long description for distribution.",
  "sources": "Imports setuptools, reads 'README.txt' and 'CHANGES.txt' files for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external system calls; static file reads.",
  "flows": "File reads supply static strings to setup parameters; no dynamic or untrusted input flows.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard setup.py pattern with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for Python packaging, involving static imports, reading documentation files, and defining package metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. Reading files for long_description is standard practice. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets are detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The assigned scores accurately reflect its safety and simplicity.",
