  "purpose": "Setup script for the MultiMapping Python package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Imports setuptools functions; reads 'README.txt' and 'CHANGES.txt' files; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no network or system command execution, no credential or sensitive data processing.",
  "flows": "Read files for long_description; package setup configuration flows with static data; no dynamic or untrusted data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The script uses standard setup procedures with no hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional Python setup script using setuptools. It imports necessary functions, specifies package metadata, reads documentation files for long_description, and defines dependencies. No dynamic code execution, external inputs, or suspicious logic is present. The use of open() calls is standard for including documentation and does not introduce risks. All operations are static and controlled.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a typical, benign package configuration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
