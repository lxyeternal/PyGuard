  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:  \n   All reports confirm that the code is a simple import statement:\n   ```python\n   from .html_void_elements import html_void_elements\n   ```\n   This is a standard relative import within a Python package, importing a specific object or module from a local module named `html_void_elements`.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:  \n   - **Confirmed Issues**: None of the reports identify any actual issues—no suspicious behavior, malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - **Errors or Flaws**: The reports are consistent in stating that the code is minimal and benign.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - **Confidence**: All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated**: All are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - **Malware**: All are 0, indicating no malware activity detected or suspected.\n   - **Security Risk**: All are 0, consistent with the benign assessment.\n\n4. **Risk and Malware Scores Justification**:\n   - Since the code is purely an import statement with no external data handling, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity, the risk score should remain very low.\n   - Malware score should be 0, as there is no indication of malicious intent or activity.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, matching the reports.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Concerns**:\n   - The reports are consistent and do not overstate or understate any risks.\n   - The scores are reasonable given the context.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly notes the absence of suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a benign, standard import statement.\n   - No signs of supply chain attack, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n   - The scores reflect this understanding accurately.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score**: Keep at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score**: Keep at 0.\n- **Risk Score**: Keep at 0, as there's no evidence of security issues.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**: The code snippet is entirely benign. The reports and scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No changes are necessary.",
