  "review": "Let's analyze these reports systematically:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\nAll reports describe the code as a simple import statement:\n```python\nfrom .html_void_elements import html_void_elements\n```\nThis is consistent across all reports, and the original code matches this description.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues:**\n- **Issues Confirmed?** No. The code is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or data handling.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Reports?** No significant errors. All reports correctly identify the minimal, benign nature of the code.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n- **Confidence:** All reports assign a confidence of 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All report 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All report 0, indicating no malicious behavior detected or suspected.\n- **Security Risk:** All report 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification of Risk and Malware Scores:**\n- Since no malicious activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n- The security risk score of 0 is appropriate given the benign context.\n- The code does not involve external inputs, network communication, or dynamic code execution.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions:**\n- The reports assume that import statements are benign, which is generally valid. However, in supply chain security, even seemingly benign code could be part of a malicious package if the package itself is compromised.\n- But based solely on this snippet, there are no signs of malicious intent.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The scores reflect the minimal and safe nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard import statement with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. It is benign and typical in Python projects.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code snippet. No changes to scores are necessary. The overall security posture based on this snippet is very low risk, with no malware or obfuscation detected.",
