{
  "purpose": "This code imports a module named 'html_void_elements' from a relative package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name 'html_void_elements' from the relative import statement.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects; the code only imports a module.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets. The only unusual aspect is that it's a relative import, which is common in packages but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement for a module named 'html_void_elements'. There are no input sources, data processing, or output sinks. The import is a standard Python operation; there is no indication of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. The simplicity suggests this is part of a larger codebase, likely dealing with HTML processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a typical import function with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
