{
  "purpose": "This code performs a relative import of 'html_void_elements' from a local module, likely for use within a larger package or module.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is the source; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leakage.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a static import statement with no runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement, which is common in Python packages. It does not involve data processing, external communication, or dynamic execution. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code's minimal and standard structure supports a conclusion of no security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, representing a standard import statement within a Python package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All assessments and scores are consistent with this analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
