  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code snippet.\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\nfrom .html_void_elements import html_void_elements\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Presence of Issues\n- The code is a straightforward relative import statement.\n- No data processing, external communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThere are **no issues** with the code itself; it appears benign.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the import as benign, with no malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Also correctly states the import is standard and harmless.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same as above; the import is straightforward and benign.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no change needed.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the import is normal and no malicious behavior is evident.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others; a simple import with no suspicious features.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Verdict:** Accurate; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n### Final Recommendations\n- **Scores:** Remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk.\n- **Risk scores:** Justifiably low; no adjustments needed.\n- **Malware Score Justification:** Since no malicious activity or code is present, a malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score Justification:** The code is clear and straightforward; obfuscation is not present.\n- **Security Risk Score Justification:** The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **All reports are accurate.**\n- **The code is benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns.**\n- **Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.**\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms that the code snippet is safe and standard for Python projects.",
