  "sources": "None; the code only contains a static list declaration.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks exists.",
  "anomalies": "The list includes standard HTML tags; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a list of HTML void element names as string literals. No input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. The list appears to be for HTML parsing or templating purposes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code structure is straightforward and static, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, defining a static list of HTML tags. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
