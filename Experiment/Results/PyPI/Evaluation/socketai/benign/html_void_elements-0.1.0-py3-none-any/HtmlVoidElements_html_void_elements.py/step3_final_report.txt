  "purpose": "List of HTML void tag names for use in HTML parsing or validation.",
  "sources": "Static list declaration within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static list with no input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static list, includes deprecated tags but no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static list of HTML void elements, with no input, output, or dynamic behavior. No external dependencies or data flows are present. The list includes some deprecated tags, but their inclusion does not imply malicious intent. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are evident. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and static nature justify these assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static list of HTML void tags with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or correction is necessary.",
