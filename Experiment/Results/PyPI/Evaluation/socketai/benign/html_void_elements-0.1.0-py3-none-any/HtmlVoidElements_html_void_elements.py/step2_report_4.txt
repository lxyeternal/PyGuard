  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static list declaration of HTML void elements.\n- No external input, data processing, or dynamic behavior is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The inclusion of outdated or less common tags (e.g., 'basefont', 'bgsound', 'isindex', 'keygen') is noted but not problematic in terms of security.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk is also correctly scored as 0, given the code's simplicity and static nature.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are very consistent and thorough; no logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) seem appropriate and justified.\n- No report claims or implies any malicious behavior or security concern beyond the benign static list.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a straightforward, static list of HTML void tags.\n- There are no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation.\n- The scoring in all reports is reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\nNo adjustments are necessary. The reports are accurate, and the code poses no security threat.",
