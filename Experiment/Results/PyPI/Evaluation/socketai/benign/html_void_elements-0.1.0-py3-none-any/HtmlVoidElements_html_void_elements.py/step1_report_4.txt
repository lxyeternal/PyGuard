  "purpose": "Define a list of HTML void (self-closing) tag names for use in HTML or web-related processing.",
  "sources": "The list is hardcoded within the script, with no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing of untrusted input; the code only defines a static list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code features; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code simply declares a list of HTML void elements, which are standard and recognized in HTML specifications. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no data manipulation, and no suspicious behavior observed. The code does not perform any operations beyond defining this list.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely declarative, and contains no malicious intent. It serves as a static resource for identifying HTML void tags.",
