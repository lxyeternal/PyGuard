  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a static list of HTML void tags.\n- No external input, data processing, or dynamic behavior is involved.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The list includes some deprecated or less common tags (e.g., 'basefont', 'bgsound', 'isindex', 'keygen'), but their inclusion does not imply malicious intent.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The security risk is also 0, as expected.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not perform any operations beyond defining a static list.\n- No data flows, sinks, or sources are present.\n- The reasoning in all reports is sound and consistent.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The inclusion of outdated or deprecated tags like 'basefont', 'bgsound', 'isindex', and 'keygen' could be noted as a minor concern if the list is intended for modern HTML validation, but this is not a security issue.\n- Since the code is purely declarative, there's no reason to adjust the malware or security risk scores.\n\n**Score evaluation:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The risk scores are all 0, also appropriate.\n- The confidence levels are 1, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- No changes to scores are necessary.\n- The code is a benign static list with no security concerns.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The code is a straightforward, static list of HTML void tags with no security implications.",
