  "purpose": "Define a list of HTML void (self-closing) tag names for use in HTML processing or validation.",
  "sources": "The list is hardcoded within the script, no external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code merely initializes a list.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple list definition with standard HTML tags.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining a list of standard HTML void elements. There are no dynamic elements, input handling, or external dependencies. The list includes common HTML tags, some of which are outdated or less common (e.g., 'basefont', 'bgsound', 'isindex', 'keygen'), but their inclusion does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign definition of HTML void elements for potential use in HTML validation or parsing. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks.",
