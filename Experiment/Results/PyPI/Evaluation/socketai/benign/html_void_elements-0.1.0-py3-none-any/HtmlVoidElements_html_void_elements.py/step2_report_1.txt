  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a static list of HTML void element tags, with no input/output, no dynamic behavior, and no external dependencies.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The list includes standard and some deprecated or less common tags, but their inclusion does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and evaluations:\n\n**1. Presence of issues in the code:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, defining a list of strings. No issues are present.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident in the code itself.\n\n**2. Logical reasoning and summary:**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that this is a static list with no data processing, external inputs, or malicious behavior.\n- They also correctly note that inclusion of deprecated tags (e.g., 'basefont', 'bgsound', 'isindex', 'keygen') is not problematic but may be outdated.\n\n**3. Scores assigned:**\n\n- All reports assign `malware: 0`, `securityRisk: 0`, and `obfuscated: 0`.\n- Confidence is 1 in all cases, which is reasonable given the static nature of the code.\n- The reasoning appears consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0. No malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Correctly 0. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** Correctly 0. No vulnerabilities or security concerns are evident.\n- **Confidence:** 1 is appropriate, given the static, benign nature.\n\n### Any potential issues or assumptions?\n\n- Some reports mention inclusion of deprecated tags. This is not a security concern but could be flagged for code modernization if needed.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all assessments are cautious and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a static list of HTML tags, with no malicious, obfuscated, or vulnerable aspects.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly assess that this code is benign and pose no security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or correction is necessary.",
