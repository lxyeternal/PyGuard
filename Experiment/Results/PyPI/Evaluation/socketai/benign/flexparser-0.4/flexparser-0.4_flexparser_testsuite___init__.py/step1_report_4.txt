  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the implementation of a Python package, potentially providing some functionality to other projects. The exact purpose is not explicitly stated in the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, imported modules, and possibly user input via function parameters or external data sources (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or execution commands if present (none explicitly identified).",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input sources into functions or modules that may process or transmit this data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are visibly present. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are evident. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed at the beginning, middle, and end sections. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, suspicious network activity, or backdoors were detected. Usage of third-party libraries is typical and does not raise suspicion. No hidden or obfuscated code was found. The code structure and behavior are consistent with standard Python programming practices.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe, with no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious activities identified.",
