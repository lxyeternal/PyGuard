{
  "purpose": "This code defines and tests classes for parsing a custom syntax with block and root structures, focusing on validation, formatting, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from string inputs in test cases; no external data sources or network calls are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks such as database, file, or network operations; no untrusted data processing beyond in-memory parsing and comparison.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into statement iterators, then into block and statement objects, with no data exported or transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code primarily consists of class definitions, assertions, and test functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports parsing classes and testing frameworks, then defines subclasses of parsing structures. It tests formatting, parsing, and error handling with assertions. No external data or network operations are present. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are identified. The code functions solely within the scope of parsing and validation logic, with no suspicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward test suite for parsing classes with no malicious behavior or security risks. It contains no network, file, or system access that could be exploited maliciously. Overall, the code is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
