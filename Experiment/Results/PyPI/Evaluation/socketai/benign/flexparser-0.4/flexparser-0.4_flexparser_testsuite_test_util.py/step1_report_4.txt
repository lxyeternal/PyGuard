{
  "purpose": "The code provides unit tests for functions related to type handling and hashing in the flexparser package.",
  "sources": "Code reads test input data (e.g., content bytes for hashing) and type annotations for type handling functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks, code execution, or system effects; no untrusted data handling or output manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (bytes) is processed to generate hashes; type annotations inform type processing functions, but no flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation; use of standard libraries and straightforward tests.",
  "analysis": "The code is composed of standard test functions verifying type extraction and hashing functionality. It uses standard libraries such as hashlib and pytest. No dynamic code execution, no input from untrusted sources, and no network activity. The tests are self-contained and serve to verify package behavior, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of unit tests for type handling and hashing functions within the flexparser package. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code appears legitimate and focused solely on validation.",
