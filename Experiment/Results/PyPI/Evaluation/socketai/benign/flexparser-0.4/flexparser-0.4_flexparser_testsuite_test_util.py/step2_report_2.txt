  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is composed of straightforward unit tests.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- Hash functions use static, hardcoded byte strings.\n- No suspicious or obfuscated code patterns are evident.\n- No hardcoded secrets beyond test data.\n- The code does not exhibit malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n**Specific issues and scoring considerations:**\n\n### Malware Score\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity—no network, no code injection, no data exfiltration.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n### Obfuscated Score\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The code is clear, well-structured, and uses standard libraries.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are observed.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n\n### Security Risk Score\n- Most reports assign a score of 0, with one report assigning 0.1.\n- The only point of contention is whether the hashing of static data could pose any risk.\n- Since hashing static test data is common and safe, the risk is negligible.\n- The report with 0.1 perhaps overstates the risk; unless there is some hidden vulnerability, the risk remains minimal.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep the security risk score at 0 for consistency and accuracy.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is purely for testing purposes.\n- No external or untrusted input is involved.\n- No malicious or obfuscated behavior.\n- The slight variation in the security risk score (0.1) in one report is unwarranted; the overall consensus should be 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Security risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent in their analysis, but the security risk score should be uniformly zero across all reports, given the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The overall security posture of this code is very safe; it is standard testing code with no security concerns.",
