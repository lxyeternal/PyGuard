  "purpose": "Unit tests for the 'flexparser' library, verifying type handling and hashing functionalities.",
  "sources": "Static byte strings used in hashing functions, type annotations for yield type extraction.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input or data flow to external systems.",
  "flows": "Hashing static data, type annotations to yield types.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward unit tests on static data, with no external data sources, network activity, or dynamic code execution. Hash functions are used on fixed byte strings, and type extraction functions operate on known type annotations. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is present. The code's purpose is solely to verify internal functionalities, and it does not process untrusted input or perform any security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing purposes, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score should be 0 across all reports. The slight variation in one report's risk score (0.1) is unwarranted given the static, controlled nature of the code.",
