{
  "purpose": "Provides classes and functions for creating parsers in Python, mainly for content processing and structure validation.",
  "sources": "Imports version information from importlib.metadata; imports parser-related classes and functions from internal module .flexparser.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no external data handling or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; module imports and version detection are static and internal.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors identified. The version detection is standard practice, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module metadata, imports, and exports. It uses try-except for safe version detection, which is normal. All imported items are from a local or standard library, with no suspicious behavior. No data input, output, or network communication observed. No anomalies or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard, benign code for parser class definitions and functions, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
