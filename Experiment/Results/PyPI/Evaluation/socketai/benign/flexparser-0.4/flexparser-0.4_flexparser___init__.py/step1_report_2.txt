{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports classes, functions, and version information for the 'flexparser' package, a parsing library.",
  "sources": "Reads version information via importlib.metadata.version and package metadata, imports internal module components.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data, user input, or sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Imports version info and internal module classes/functions; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code appears standard for a package __init__.py file.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages package metadata and re-exports of classes/functions. The use of importlib.metadata.version is safe; exception handling is standard. No external data is processed or handled insecurely. The code structure is straightforward and typical for Python package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initializer, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It simply sets up the package metadata and exports, with no suspicious logic or data flows.",
