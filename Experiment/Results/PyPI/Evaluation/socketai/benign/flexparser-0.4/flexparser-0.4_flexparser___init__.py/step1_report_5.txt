{
  "purpose": "This source code provides class and function definitions for a content parser library called 'flexparser'. It sets up imports, version handling, and exports for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from importlib.metadata, the local module .flexparser, and the version function. No external input sources or untrusted data handling present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data, no network calls, file operations, or sensitive data processing present.",
  "flows": "The code primarily defines module metadata and imports. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be straightforward module setup and import/export declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines version handling logic with a try-except block. It imports classes and functions from a local module '.flexparser' and sets up an __all__ list for export. There are no input handling, user data processing, or network operations. The code structure is typical for a Python package's __init__.py or main module. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected based on the code provided.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, primarily defining exports and version information. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
