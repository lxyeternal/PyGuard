{
  "purpose": "The code provides a module for creating and managing content parsers, including importing necessary components, defining version handling, and exporting relevant classes and functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard library modules (`importlib.metadata`) and internal package components (`.flexparser`).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive or harmful actions are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual behavior, are observed. Version handling is standard, with fallback logic. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, version handling, and the definition of `__all__`. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or include any suspicious or malicious code. The only dynamic aspect is retrieving package version info, which is standard and safe. No code injection, data leakage, or backdoor mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, well-structured module meant for parsing content with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is a typical package initialization script with no harmful behavior.",
