{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python module for creating and managing parsers in the flexparser library, including version handling, imports, and exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements (__future__, importlib.metadata, try-except block), module-level variable definitions (__version__, __all__)",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows identified; version retrieval is safe, and imports are static",
  "anomalies": "Use of importlib.metadata.version to dynamically retrieve package version is standard; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports necessary modules, handles versioning with exception fallback, and declares public API exports. No user input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution beyond version fetching, and no malicious logic observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward module initialization script for the flexparser package, with standard version handling and explicit exports. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
