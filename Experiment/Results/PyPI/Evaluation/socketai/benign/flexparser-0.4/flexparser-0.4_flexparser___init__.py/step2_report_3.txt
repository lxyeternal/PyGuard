  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to assess the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, standard package initialization code.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are identified.\n- The code is mainly import statements, version handling, and export declarations.\n- No untrusted data handling, network activity, or sensitive operations are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code appears syntactically correct and functionally straightforward.\n- **Malicious indicators:** None detected—no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic.\n- **Data flows:** No untrusted input flows to sensitive sinks.\n- **Version handling:** Standard try-except fallback for package version retrieval.\n- **Exports:** Clear and typical for a Python package.\n\n### Scores assessment:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign analysis.\n\n### Critical points:\n- The code does not process untrusted input or perform any sensitive operations.\n- The use of `importlib.metadata.version` is standard and safe.\n- The exception handling for version retrieval is common practice.\n- No anomalies, suspicious imports, or obfuscation are present.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Adjustments to scores:** The current scores seem appropriate; no changes needed.\n- **Risk justification:** Since the code is purely setup and import/export, the risk is minimal, justifying a score of 0.\n- **Malware justification:** No malicious activity, so malware score remains 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** No obfuscation detected, score remains 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the provided code and reports, the overall security risk is negligible.** The code is standard, well-structured, and free from malicious indicators.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical package initialization module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
