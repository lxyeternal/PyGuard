{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the main module setup for the 'flexparser' package, handling version detection, importing internal components, and defining exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version via importlib.metadata.version, and imports classes/functions from the local flexparser module.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs, no network connections, and no sensitive data handling; thus, no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves retrieving the package version, importing internal classes/functions, and exporting them via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package initialization script with safe version retrieval and explicit exports. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The exception handling for version retrieval is common practice. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. The code's structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file, indicating benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured package setup module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
