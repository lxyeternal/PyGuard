  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to assess the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward package initialization (__init__.py) that imports modules, handles version info, and exports classes/functions.\n- No untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or anomalies are detected.\n- All reports consistently identify the code as benign, with a confidence of 1.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Code correctness and intent:** The code performs standard package setup, with safe version retrieval and module exports.\n- **Malicious activity:** None observed.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** None, as the code does not process untrusted input or perform sensitive operations.\n\n### Logical/Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- No flawed reasoning or mistakes are evident.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, justified by the absence of any security issues.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- The only dynamic aspect is `importlib.metadata.version`, which is standard and safe.\n- The try-except block for version handling is common practice.\n- No external data handling or security-sensitive operations.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n**Based on the detailed review:**\n\n| Score Type     | Suggested Value | Justification                                              |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0                 | No malicious code or behavior detected.                     |\n| Obfuscated     | 0                 | Code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.        |\n| Risk           | 0                 | No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.          |\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThis code is a standard package setup module with no security concerns. It should be considered safe and low risk.",
