{
  "purpose": "The code implements a comprehensive parsing framework with classes for statements, blocks, resource handling, and hashing. It is designed for flexible source code analysis and project management, supporting resource files, byte streams, and hierarchical parsing.",
  "sources": "File I/O via pathlib.Path, resource loading via importlib.resources, bytes input, and raw string data.",
  "sinks": "No data exfiltration, network activity, or external data sinks are present. The code reads files/resources and processes data internally.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into parsing classes, resource handlers, and hashing routines. No external or malicious data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The dynamic hash selection is benign and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, standard parsing utility using common Python modules and design patterns. It handles resources securely, performs content hashing, and manages hierarchical source structures. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage are evident. The resource handling and hashing routines are routine in such frameworks. The code does not execute untrusted code, connect to networks, or contain hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured open-source parsing framework with no malicious intent or sabotage features. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are correctly set to 0. The overall assessment is consistent with the code content.",
