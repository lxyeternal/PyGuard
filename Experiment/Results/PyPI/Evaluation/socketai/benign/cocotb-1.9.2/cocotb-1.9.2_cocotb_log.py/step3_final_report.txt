{
  "purpose": "The code sets up logging for the cocotb framework, configuring log levels, formatters, and simulation time annotations based on environment variables and internal utilities.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., COCOTB_LOG_LEVEL), imported modules (logging, os, sys, cocotb utilities), and internal functions for simulation time.",
  "sinks": "Logging output directed to stdout with formatted messages; no external data transfer or network activity.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log level; log records include simulation time; messages are formatted and output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected; code is straightforward configuration for logging.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes logging handlers, formatters, and filters, incorporating environment variables for log level control. Custom formatters add simulation time annotations. No external data leaks, network activity, or obfuscated code are present. The code is well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, and uses standard practices for logging setup. No signs of malicious intent or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard logging configuration module for cocotb, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores are consistent: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, reflecting typical configuration practices with minimal inherent risk.",
