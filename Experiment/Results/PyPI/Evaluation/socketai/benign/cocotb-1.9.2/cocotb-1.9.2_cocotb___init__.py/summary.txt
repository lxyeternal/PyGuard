  "conclusion": "The code is standard test environment setup code with no malicious behavior. The main concern is the use of eval() on plusargs for seed configuration, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but in controlled testing contexts, this is unlikely. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). The existing reports' scores are appropriate; I recommend maintaining these scores, with a note to replace eval() with safer parsing to eliminate even this minimal risk."
