{
  "purpose": "The script is a setup script for the cocotb Python package, handling package configuration, dependency management, and build instructions.",
  "sources": "Reads files such as README.md, _version.py, and directory structures for package data; reads environment via sys and os modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; the script does not process untrusted input or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "File reading flows from filesystem to variables; package data collection; setup configuration processes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to run code from '_version.py' may be risky if the file is maliciously modified; appends to sys.path; uses open() with encoding for file reading, which is standard. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with proper file reading, package data collection, and configuration for building a Python package. The use of 'exec' on '_version.py' is a potential security concern if the version file is compromised, but this is a common pattern in setup scripts. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, code injection, or data exfiltration. The script does not handle untrusted input, execute external commands beyond build extensions, or include malicious payloads. All third-party library uses are standard and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with minimal security risks. The only noteworthy point is the use of 'exec' on a local version file, which is a common pattern but could be risky if the file is tampered with. No malware, malicious behavior, or obfuscation detected. Overall security risk is very low.",
