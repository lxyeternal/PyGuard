  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging the cocotb library, including version assignment, package data collection, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '_version.py' via exec(), reads files for long description, walks directories for package data, and imports build extensions.",
  "sinks": "Uses open() for file reading, exec() for version assignment, and standard setup() parameters; no untrusted data handling or external commands.",
  "flows": "File reading feeds into variables; exec() executes '_version.py' content to set __version__; setup() uses collected data to build package.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on '_version.py' is common but can be risky if the file is compromised; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical, well-structured setup.py with standard practices. The exec() pattern for versioning is common but could pose risks if the version file is malicious. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 are justified given the context, with the minor risk associated with exec(). Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The use of exec() is typical but should be maintained with trusted files. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are accurate.",
