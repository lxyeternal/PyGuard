  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key points: code behavior, potential vulnerabilities, malicious indicators, and consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, uses 'exec' to assign version from '_version.py'. No malicious activity detected.  \n- **Analysis:** The use of 'exec' is common in setup scripts but can be risky if the version file is compromised. However, in this context, it's a typical pattern. No suspicious dependencies or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 seem reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues.  \n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The low risk score aligns with the standard practice, and no malware is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the use of 'exec' on '_version.py' as a potential risk but standard practice.  \n- **Analysis:** Same points as above; no malicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or vulnerabilities.  \n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. The use of 'exec' is noted but not considered malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Again, a typical setup.py, with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Analysis:** No external commands, no untrusted input processing, standard practices.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 fit well.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe and standard.  \n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Standard setup script, minimal security risk, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, and no dangerous data handling.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 are appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate setup script.\n\n**Assessment:** Well justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Standard setup, no signs of malicious activity, proper version enforcement.  \n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code, no network activity, no obfuscation, standard practices.  \n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 are reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence of concern:** The only noteworthy pattern is the use of 'exec' to load version info from '_version.py'. This is common but can be risky if the file is maliciously modified. However, in the context of a trusted package, it's standard practice.\n- **Malware suspicion:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, primarily due to the 'exec' pattern, which is standard but should be noted.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk around 0.1-0.2) are appropriate.\n- No changes needed; the analysis is consistent with the code.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to 'exec' pattern, which is standard but should be acknowledged)\n\n**In conclusion,** the code is a standard, well-structured setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
