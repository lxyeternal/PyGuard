{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and configures the Python package 'cocotb' for distribution, including dependency management, package data, and entry points.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys.path, file reads via read_file(), walk() for directory traversal, imported modules, and environment variables for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "File operations (reading files), system exit via SystemExit, printing logs, and package setup functions.",
  "flows": "Input: Version check via sys.version_info, file reads via read_file(), directory walk to gather package files. Output: SystemExit on version mismatch, setup configuration and logs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The code appears to perform standard setup tasks without suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures, including version checks, reading files, directory traversal for package data, and logging. The version check enforces a minimum Python version, which is typical. Importing build extension modules and defining setup parameters is routine. No indications of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated sections are present. No suspicious system calls or code injections are identified. The code structure is clear and conforms to standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It primarily handles package configuration and dependency management. The overall security risk is minimal.",
