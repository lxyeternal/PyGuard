  "purpose": "A comprehensive test harness for cocotb-based FPGA/ASIC verification, managing test discovery, execution, reporting, and optional coverage collection.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for test discovery and configuration, dynamic module imports, test functions, and debugging tools like pdb.",
  "sinks": "Output reports to files and logs; no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Test discovery via environment variables, dynamic import of modules, creation of tests through factory functions, execution, and reporting.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pdb for debugging, environment variables for configuration, optional coverage collection, all typical for testing frameworks.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured test management framework for cocotb, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. It employs common practices such as dynamic imports, environment-driven configuration, and debugging support. No network activity, data leaks, or hidden backdoors are present. The use of environment variables and pdb is typical for debugging and test setup, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source testing framework with no malicious or obfuscated components. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified. The high confidence scores reflect thorough analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
