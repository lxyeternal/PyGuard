  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate build infrastructure code for cocotb extensions, with no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation. The subprocess calls and file operations are standard, and the overall security assessment is appropriate. The low risk scores reflect typical build process risks, which are unlikely to be exploited maliciously in a controlled environment."
