{
  "purpose": "Framework for managing HDL simulation objects within cocotb, including handle creation, value setting, querying, and hierarchy management.",
  "sources": "Handle method calls (get_type, iterate, get_name_string, get_handle_by_name, get_handle_by_index), attribute access, operator overloads (__le__, property setters).",
  "sinks": "Handle value modification via set_signal_val_* methods, property setters, and __le__ operator, which invoke internal _set_value() methods that call simulator API functions.",
  "flows": "Internal data flow within the simulation environment, from handle method calls and attribute access to handle value modification functions; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns detected. Use of warnings and deprecation notices are standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured, standard implementation of HDL object management in cocotb. It employs typical patterns such as caching, dynamic object creation, and safe handle interactions. No suspicious or malicious logic, external communication, or obfuscation patterns are present. The purpose and behavior align with common simulation API practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe, and standard cocotb HDL simulation object management library. No signs of supply chain compromise, sabotage, or malicious intent are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.1, reflecting very low risk.",
