{
  "purpose": "Defines version comparison classes for various simulation tools used in hardware description language verification, based on the LooseVersion class from distutils.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'LooseVersion' from 'cocotb._vendor.distutils_version'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only defines classes and methods without executing or processing external data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply provides class definitions and parsing logic for version strings.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes multiple class definitions that inherit from a common version class, with a specific override in 'QuestaVersion.parse' to process version strings. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present. The only notable feature is the custom parsing in 'QuestaVersion', which is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several classes inheriting from 'LooseVersion', intended for comparing version strings of various hardware simulation tools. Each class is a pass-through subclass, except 'QuestaVersion' which overrides 'parse' to extract the first component of a version string for comparison. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or other suspicious behaviors. The purpose appears to be purely to facilitate version comparison. No anomalies such as hidden code, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and intended solely for version comparison logic. No malicious activity, supply chain threats, or security risks are present.",
