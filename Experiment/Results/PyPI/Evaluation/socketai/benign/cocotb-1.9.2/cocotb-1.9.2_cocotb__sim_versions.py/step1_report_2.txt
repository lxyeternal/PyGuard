{
  "purpose": "Defines version comparison classes for various HDL simulators and tools, facilitating version handling and comparisons.",
  "sources": "Imports 'LooseVersion' from 'cocotb._vendor.distutils_version'; no other data inputs or external data reading sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data for output, storage, or network transmission.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the classes inherit and utilize 'LooseVersion' for version parsing and comparison, with no data transformation or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation; the code is straightforward class inheritance and method override with comments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard library for version comparison and defines multiple subclasses for specific HDL tools, each with documented example usage. The 'parse' method in 'QuestaVersion' customizes version string parsing, but no untrusted input is handled directly; no code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. The code is purely for internal version comparison logic with no network or I/O operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module for version comparison with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It employs standard practices for subclassing and version parsing without external interactions.",
