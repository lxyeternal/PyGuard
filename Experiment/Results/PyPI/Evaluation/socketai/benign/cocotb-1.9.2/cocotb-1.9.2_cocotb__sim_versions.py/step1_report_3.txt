{
  "purpose": "Define version comparison classes for various simulation tools using a common base class.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'LooseVersion' class from 'cocotb._vendor.distutils_version'. No external input sources or data reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points related to untrusted data processing are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The classes are only wrappers around version parsing and comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed. The code is straightforward and primarily for version handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple subclasses of 'LooseVersion' for different simulation tools, each with descriptive docstrings and minimal logic. The only method override is in 'QuestaVersion', where the 'parse' method extracts the first component of a version string, which is a normal parsing behavior. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. No external data input or output occurs. The classes serve as data structures for version comparison without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for version comparison purposes, with no malicious intent, no malicious behavior, and no security risks detected. It is a standard implementation for version handling with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
