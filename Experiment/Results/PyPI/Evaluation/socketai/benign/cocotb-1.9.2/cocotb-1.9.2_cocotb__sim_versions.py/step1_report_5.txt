{
  "purpose": "Define version comparison classes for various HDL simulation tools, inheriting from a common version class.",
  "sources": "Imports from cocotb._vendor.distutils_version, class definitions, and string parsing in the parse method.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data output or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "String inputs to version classes flow through parsing methods; no external data flows to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a 'parse' method in QuestaVersion that overrides a superclass method, but no actual code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines subclasses of a version comparison class, with descriptive docstrings and minimal logic. The parse method in QuestaVersion extracts the first part of a string for comparison. There are no functions executing external commands, handling sensitive data, or performing unsafe operations. The code structure is straightforward and focuses solely on data parsing and comparison. No suspicious code or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of class definitions for version handling, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any harmful or obfuscated code and appears to be a standard utility module.",
