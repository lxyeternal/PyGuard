{
  "purpose": "The code implements a waveform tracing utility compatible with WaveDrom, used for capturing and exporting signal waveforms during simulation.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'cocotb' library, especially signal handles, bus objects, and clock signals; reading signal values during sampling.",
  "sinks": "Writing JSON waveform data to files through the 'write' method; no other output sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Signal values are sampled in the '_monitor' coroutine upon clock edges, stored internally, and later exported as JSON through 'dumpj' or 'write' methods.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. Use of 'cocotb' and related simulation libraries is standard. No obfuscation or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and cocotb modules for HDL simulation and waveform recording. It defines classes for waveform data collection ('Wavedrom') and signal tracing ('trace') with methods to sample signals, manage tracing state, and export data. The sampling relies on signal handles and clock edges, which are standard for testbench waveform capture. The code safely manages file writing and JSON serialization without executing external or malicious commands. No anomalous or malicious behaviors such as network communication, credential handling, or backdoor mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate waveform tracing utility compatible with WaveDrom, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is designed solely for simulation signal capture and export, with standard practices and no suspicious behavior.",
