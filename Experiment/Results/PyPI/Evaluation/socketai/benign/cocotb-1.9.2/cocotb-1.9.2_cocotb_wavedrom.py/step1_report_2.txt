{
  "purpose": "This code provides a tracing utility for hardware simulation signals, specifically compatible with WaveDrom visualization, enabling signal sampling, gap insertion, and data export in JSON format.",
  "sources": "Input sources include signal objects (SimHandleBase, Bus, or Mapping) during Wavedrom class instantiation, and a clock signal passed to the trace context manager.",
  "sinks": "Data exported via the dumpj() method to a JSON file; no untrusted data processing or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Signals are sampled during RisingEdge of the clock, stored internally, then exported via dumpj() to JSON, which is written to files with write().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of async functions and dynamic attributes appears standard for cocotb-based simulations. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for capturing signal states during hardware simulation, including sampling, gap insertion, and exporting to WaveDrom-compatible JSON. The import of cocotb modules suggests it runs within a testbench environment. No external or network activity, nor any code that could execute malicious actions, is present. It primarily manages data collection and serialization. There are no apparent anomalies or malicious behaviors, and the code adheres to typical cocotb usage patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign utility for hardware simulation tracing. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. Its purpose is to facilitate signal visualization in waveform viewers. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
