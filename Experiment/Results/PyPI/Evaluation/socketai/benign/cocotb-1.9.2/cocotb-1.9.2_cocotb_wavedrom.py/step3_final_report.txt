{
  "purpose": "A waveform tracer compatible with WaveDrom, used within cocotb-based simulation environments to sample signals and export waveform data as JSON.",
  "sources": "Signal handles, buses, and simulation signal objects accessed via cocotb modules and handle attributes.",
  "sinks": "JSON files written via dumpj() or write() methods, exporting sampled waveform data.",
  "flows": "Sampling occurs on clock edges within the _monitor coroutine, storing signal states; data is serialized into JSON format for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, backdoors, obfuscation, or external network activity detected; standard cocotb usage patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard waveform capture utility for HDL simulation, sampling signal values during clock edges, storing them, and exporting as JSON for visualization with WaveDrom. It does not include any malicious logic, obfuscation, or external communication. The structure and functions are typical for such tools, with proper handling of signal data and file output. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign waveform tracing utility used in hardware simulation environments. It poses no security threat or malicious intent, with all indicators pointing to standard, safe functionality.",
