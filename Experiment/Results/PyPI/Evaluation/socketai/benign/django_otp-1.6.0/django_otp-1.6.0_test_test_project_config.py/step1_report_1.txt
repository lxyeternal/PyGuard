{
  "purpose": "Load configuration data from a file or environment variables, primarily for Django settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'DJANGO_OTP_CONFIG' and 'HATCH_ENV_ACTIVE'; file system (os.path.exists and open).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks leading to data leaks or malicious actions; file reading is standard and controlled by environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variables determine the config file path; if present, the file is loaded; otherwise, fallback to other configs or empty dict.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; conditional configuration loading is typical. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally loads a configuration file based on environment variables, with safe checks for file existence. Uses standard library modules and exception handling. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior detected. No suspicious obfuscation or backdoors apparent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration loader with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It safely handles missing files and environment-driven configuration. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
