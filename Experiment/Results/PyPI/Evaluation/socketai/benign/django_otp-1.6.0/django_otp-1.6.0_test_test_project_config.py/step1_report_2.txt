{
  "purpose": "Load configuration data from a specified file or environment variable, primarily for Django application setup.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'DJANGO_OTP_CONFIG' and 'HATCH_ENV_ACTIVE', and the configuration file path obtained from 'DJANGO_OTP_CONFIG'.",
  "sinks": "File opening and reading using open(), loading config with tomllib.load(). No dangerous sink identified.",
  "flows": "Environment variables determine the configuration file path, which is then read using safe file I/O; no untrusted data flows directly into dangerous operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors observed. The code handles config loading safely and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code safely loads configuration files based on environment variables with proper existence checks. It uses standard library modules and does not execute untrusted code. No obfuscation or malicious intent apparent. The only potential concern is reliance on environment variables for config paths, but this is common and not inherently insecure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration loader with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It securely loads configuration data based on environment variables without executing or exposing sensitive data.",
