{
  "purpose": "Load configuration data from a TOML file specified by environment variables or default paths.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'DJANGO_OTP_CONFIG' and 'HATCH_ENV_ACTIVE', file system checks and reads with open() and tomllib.load().",
  "sinks": "Reading environment variables and reading configuration files; no direct data leaks or untrusted data processing beyond reading configuration files.",
  "flows": "Environment variables determine configuration file paths which are then read via safe file open and tomllib.load(); no untrusted data processing flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or unusual code patterns, no obfuscated code, no backdoors or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code loads configuration data conditionally based on environment variables. It employs safe file handling with context managers and uses standard modules. It includes fallback logic and error handling for missing files, and avoids dangerous practices like eval or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration loader without malicious intent. It uses safe patterns and proper error handling. No security risks or malware indications detected.",
