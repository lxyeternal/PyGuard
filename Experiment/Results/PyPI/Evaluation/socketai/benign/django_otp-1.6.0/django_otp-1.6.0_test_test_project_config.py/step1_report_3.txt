{
  "purpose": "Load configuration data from a TOML file specified by environment variables or a default path.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'DJANGO_OTP_CONFIG' and 'HATCH_ENV_ACTIVE'. File system when reading configuration files.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations. No direct sink of untrusted data leading to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Environment variables determine file paths; files are read to load configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior. Use of standard libraries for configuration loading. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code loads configuration data from files specified by environment variables or defaults. It performs environment checks, reads files with safe methods, and raises exceptions for missing required files. There is no code injection, malicious network activity, or suspicious behavior. Usage of environment variables and file I/O appears standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration loader with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply loads configuration data from environment-specified or default paths without any suspicious or malicious activity.",
