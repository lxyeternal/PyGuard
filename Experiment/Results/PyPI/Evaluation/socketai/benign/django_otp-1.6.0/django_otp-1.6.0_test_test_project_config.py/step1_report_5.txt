{
  "purpose": "The code loads configuration data from a specified file or environment-based fallback.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'DJANGO_OTP_CONFIG' and 'HATCH_ENV_ACTIVE'. File system access to paths provided via environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Reading files specified by environment variables; loading configuration data into memory.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'DJANGO_OTP_CONFIG' or 'HATCH_ENV_ACTIVE' -> file path determination -> file existence check -> file loading into memory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, no unusual behavior. The code performs standard config loading.",
  "analysis": "The script safely loads configuration data based on environment variables, with checks for file existence and optional required loading. Use of 'os.path.exists' and environment variables is standard. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no data leaks are present. The import fallback for 'toml' parsing is typical. Overall, the code appears benign with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration loader with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It handles environment variables and file loading securely, with appropriate error handling.",
