{
  "purpose": "Load configuration data from a specified file path, with fallback options based on environment variables, ensuring safe file handling and error reporting.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'DJANGO_OTP_CONFIG' and 'HATCH_ENV_ACTIVE'; filesystem path checks and file opening.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; file reading is safe and controlled.",
  "flows": "Environment variables determine config file paths; existence checks precede file reading; configuration data is loaded via 'tomllib'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward use of standard libraries; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration loading with environment variable-based paths, safe existence checks, and exception handling. It uses standard libraries and does not execute untrusted code or perform network operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are present. The logic is clear, and the security posture is minimal risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and secure. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
