  "purpose": "Defines a Django application configuration class for 'test_app' within the 'test_project'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'name' attribute and the 'default_auto_field' setting within the class definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external communications are involved.",
  "flows": "The code flow is limited to class definition and attribute assignment; no data flows from input to output or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and follows standard Django patterns; no suspicious or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports AppConfig from django.apps and defines a subclass for application configuration, setting 'name' and 'default_auto_field' attributes. It contains no user input, external data handling, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Django AppConfig class definition with no malicious or suspicious code present. It serves to configure the 'test_app' application with default settings. No security risks or malware are detected.",
