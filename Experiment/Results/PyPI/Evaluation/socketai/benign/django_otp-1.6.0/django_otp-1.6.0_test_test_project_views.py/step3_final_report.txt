{
  "purpose": "The code implements Django views for static pages and protected redirects using standard authentication and OTP decorators.",
  "sources": "The decorators (@login_required, @otp_required) and redirect functions accessing static URL names ('home'). No user input or external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "The redirect responses to 'home' do not process untrusted data; no data leaks or harmful effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Authenticated or OTP-verified requests trigger redirects to 'home' without data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Django class-based and function-based views with authentication decorators. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure patterns are present. The redirect logic is static and safe. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are identified. The minimal security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is justified by the context but does not indicate actual vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and secure. All reports correctly identify no malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and no modifications are necessary.",
