{
  "purpose": "This code defines Django class-based views and function views with authentication and OTP protection for a web application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from request objects, mainly through the request parameter in each view function.",
  "sinks": "The code performs HTTP redirects using HttpResponseRedirect and reverse to generate URLs, which are safe sinks in this context.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves user requests being processed to enforce login and OTP requirements, then redirecting to the 'home' URL.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code patterns. Usage of decorators is standard. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Django views with authentication and OTP decorators to secure pages. The redirect functions use safe reverse URL resolution. No suspicious or malicious code detected. No hardcoded secrets, no unsafe input handling, and no malicious network activity or data leaks evident. The structure is straightforward and typical for Django applications implementing multi-factor authentication.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of protected views in Django with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It enforces user authentication and OTP verification appropriately. There are no anomalies or malicious code present.",
