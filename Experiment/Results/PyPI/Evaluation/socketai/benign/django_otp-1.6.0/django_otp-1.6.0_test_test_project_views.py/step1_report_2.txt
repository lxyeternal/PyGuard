  "purpose": "This code defines Django views and class-based views for rendering templates and redirecting users based on authentication and OTP verification.",
  "sources": "User request data triggering the view functions, authentication decorators, OTP decorators",
  "locks": "HttpResponseRedirect and reverse functions that determine redirection targets based on user requests",
  "flows": "User request -> decorators check authentication/OTP -> view function -> redirect to 'home' URL",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages user authentication flows with login and OTP requirements. It uses standard Django and django_otp decorators to enforce security steps. The views perform straightforward redirects to the 'home' page. There are no sources or sinks indicating untrusted data handling or potential data leaks. The structure is typical for a Django project managing user login flows. No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of authentication and OTP enforcement for Django views. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are evident based on this fragment.",
