{
  "purpose": "This code defines several Django views for a web application, including pages with login and OTP requirements, primarily for navigation and user authentication.",
  "sources": "User requests triggering the view functions (require_login, require_otp, require_login_then_otp)",
  "sinks": "HTTP redirect responses that send users to the 'home' URL after authentication checks",
  "flows": "Input requests → Authentication decorators (login_required, otp_required) → Redirect to 'home' URL",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious data leaks, no unusual code patterns, and no dynamic execution or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Django authentication decorators to protect views, ensuring only authenticated and OTP-verified users can access certain routes. It performs simple redirects without processing untrusted input or executing dangerous operations. No hidden or malicious behaviors are evident. The structure is straightforward and aligns with typical Django security practices. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of user authentication and OTP verification in a Django project, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
