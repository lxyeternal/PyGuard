  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- The code is standard Django views, using built-in decorators (`login_required`, `otp_required`) and class-based views.\n- All reports agree that there are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows.\n- The redirect targets are static URL names ('home'), and no user input is processed in a dangerous way.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware in the code snippets.\n- The use of OTP is via standard decorators, indicating multi-factor authentication, not malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Standard Django views with authentication and OTP.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious data flow.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Verdict:** Fully reasonable.\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, with emphasis on standard practices.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Verdict:** Slightly non-zero securityRisk, perhaps because of the general context, but still reasonable.\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious data handling, no obfuscation.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.1\n- **Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar static pages with authentication.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, matching the absence of obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the fact that these are authentication-related views, but no actual vulnerabilities or risks are evident.\n\n**Given the code's nature, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minimal, based on the context of authentication flows, but no real security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The reports are consistent and justified.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are warranted here; the code is standard and secure.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores are appropriate; the code is benign with no malware or obfuscation, and minimal security risk due to its nature.",
