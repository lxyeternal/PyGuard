{
  "purpose": "The code defines Django views for rendering pages and enforcing authentication and OTP requirements.",
  "sources": "User requests to access views, specifically through Django's request object.",
  "sinks": "Redirects via HttpResponseRedirect, which depend on reverse('home') URL resolution.",
  "flows": "User request → Authentication/OTP decorators → Redirects to 'home' URL",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious data flows or data leaks. Use of decorators appears standard. No unusual code patterns or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code implements basic Django view classes and functions, utilizing built-in authentication and OTP decorators to enforce security policies. The redirect targets are static URL names, not dynamic or user input. No data is being read from or written to external sources, and no malicious code or backdoors are present. The structure and usage align with typical Django practices, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of authentication and OTP enforcement in a Django application, with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
