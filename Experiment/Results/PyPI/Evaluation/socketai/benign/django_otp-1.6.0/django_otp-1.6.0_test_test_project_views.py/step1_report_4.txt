{
  "purpose": "This code defines several Django views, including class-based views for static pages and functions for login and OTP verification redirects.",
  "sources": "Request objects passed to view functions",
  "targets": "Reverse URL resolution and HttpResponseRedirect objects",
  "flows": "Request input -> view functions -> URL reversing -> redirect responses",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. Use of decorators for authentication and OTP are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Django practices for rendering static pages and redirecting authenticated users. The functions redirect users to 'home' URL after authentication checks. No data is read from untrusted sources, nor are there any suspicious or malicious code patterns. The use of 'otp_required' indicates multi-factor authentication but is implemented via standard decorators. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of authentication-based redirects with no malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to typical Django security practices without any suspicious behavior.",
