  "purpose": "Define a proxy model for TOTPDevice from django_otp.plugins.otp_totp.models",
  "sources": "Import statement for TOTPDevice from external package",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Code is minimal, standard use of Django proxy model; no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a model class and defines a proxy class without additional logic. Proxy models in Django are used to extend or alter behavior without changing the database schema. No user input, data processing, or external communication is involved. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard, benign extension of a Django OTP model.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward proxy model definition with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not process untrusted data, does not contain obfuscation, and adheres to common Django patterns.",
