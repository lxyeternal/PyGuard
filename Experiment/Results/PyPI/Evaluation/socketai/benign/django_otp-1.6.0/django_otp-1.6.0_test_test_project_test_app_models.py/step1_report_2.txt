  "purpose": "Define a proxy model for TOTPDevice from django_otp plugins to customize or extend its behavior without creating a new database table.",
  "sources": "Import statement from django_otp.plugins.otp_totp.models importing TOTPDevice",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flows; code only defines a class proxy with no additional logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward proxy class definition, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a TOTPDevice model from a well-known library (django_otp). It then defines a subclass TOTPDeviceProxy as a proxy model with Meta.proxy=True, which is a common Django pattern for extending or customizing existing models without altering the database schema. No data input/output, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The code is minimal and standard for Django proxy models.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard proxy model extension for a TOTP device in Django OTP. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, benign extension of existing functionality.",
