  "purpose": "Define a proxy model for TOTPDevice from django_otp.plugins.otp_totp.models",
  "sources": "Import statement importing TOTPDevice from an external package",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only extends a class without additional logic",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious constructs; no obfuscation or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a third-party library and creates a proxy subclass with no additional methods or logic. It serves as a proxy model for ORM purposes in Django. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or obfuscation. The code appears straightforward and typical for Django applications, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign proxy model extension of a TOTPDevice, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It functions as a structural component within Django for model inheritance or customization.",
