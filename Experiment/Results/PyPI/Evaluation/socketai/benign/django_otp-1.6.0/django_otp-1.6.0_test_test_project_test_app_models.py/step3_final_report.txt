{
  "purpose": "Define a Django proxy model class for TOTPDevice without additional logic or data manipulation.",
  "sources": "Import from django_otp.plugins.otp_totp.models, class declaration, Meta.proxy attribute.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Import source to class declaration, then to Meta.proxy setting; no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of data handling, input/output, network operations, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Django proxy model subclassing TOTPDevice with no additional logic. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate; the slight risk score of 0.1 is conservative but acceptable. No anomalies or malicious behavior are present. The code's simplicity and adherence to Django patterns indicate no security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Django proxy model with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are justified; a risk score of 0 is most accurate. No modifications are necessary.",
