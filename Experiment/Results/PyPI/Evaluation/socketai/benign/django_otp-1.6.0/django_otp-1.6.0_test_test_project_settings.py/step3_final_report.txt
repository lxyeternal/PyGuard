  "purpose": "Django project configuration setup, including dynamic loading of settings and plugins, with OTP integration.",
  "sources": "cfg.get() calls for database, middleware, plugins, settings, and globals()[k] assignments.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; configuration influences global variables and settings but does not process external untrusted input directly.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from cfg into settings, middleware, installed apps, and globals, influencing application behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of globals()[k] = v for dynamic global variable assignment; hardcoded SECRET_KEY ('test-key'); reliance on external configuration without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django configuration with dynamic elements loaded from an external 'cfg' object. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The use of globals()[k] = v, while potentially risky if cfg is malicious, is a common pattern for flexible configuration. The fixed SECRET_KEY 'test-key' is insecure for production but acceptable for testing. No evidence of malware, malicious network activity, or code injection is detected. The primary security concern is the reliance on external configuration and dynamic globals assignment, which could be exploited if the configuration source is compromised. Scores reflect low malware (0), no obfuscation (0), and moderate risk (0.2-0.3).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security considerations involve ensuring the trustworthiness of the external configuration source and securing secrets like SECRET_KEY. The overall risk is moderate due to configuration flexibility but does not indicate active threats.",
