  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external API calls, file system, network connections, dynamic code execution (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network communications, file operations, system commands, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input lead to sinks like network or file system, potentially via dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Potential use of eval/exec with untrusted data, network activity to suspicious domains, obfuscated code patterns, hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits potential dynamic execution and network activity, which could be exploited maliciously. However, without concrete code snippets confirming malicious payloads, suspicion remains moderate. The absence of obfuscation and straightforward data handling suggests low likelihood of malicious intent. Scores should reflect potential risk but not overstate suspicion. The malware score is set to 0.1, considering the possibility of misuse if untrusted data is involved. Security risk remains at 0.4 due to the potential for malicious activity if misused. Obfuscation is not detected, so score remains 0. Confidence is moderate (0.6), acknowledging uncertainty without concrete evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows potential for malicious behavior if dynamic execution involves untrusted input, but no definitive malicious payloads are identified. Scores are adjusted to reflect low but cautious concern, emphasizing the importance of verifying actual code behavior.",
