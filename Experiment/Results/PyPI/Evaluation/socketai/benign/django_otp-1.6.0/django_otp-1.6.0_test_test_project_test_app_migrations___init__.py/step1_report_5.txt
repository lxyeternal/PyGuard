  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a basic utility or application script, but the specific intent cannot be determined without more context.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'input()' function and possibly from environment variables or external files if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands executed via 'os.system' or 'subprocess', network calls, or file writes if such functions are present.",
  "flows": "Data from input or environment variables flows into system calls or network functions; specific flows depend on the code's structure.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies or suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or backdoors are identified. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. No malicious code patterns are evident. It performs basic operations without external dependencies that could be malicious. The code structure is standard, with no obfuscation or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script. However, without seeing external dependencies or execution context, this assessment is limited.",
