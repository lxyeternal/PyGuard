  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing and possibly interacting with external systems or files.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly shown; possibly reading from files or environment variables if present.",
  "sinks": "Output destinations include system calls, network connections, or file writes if used.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No suspicious network activity or unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing tasks without any signs of malicious intent. There are no indications of data exfiltration, system manipulation, or concealed backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries, if present, is typical. No risky functions such as eval, exec, or insecure network calls are identified. The structure appears straightforward and aligned with common programming practices.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no evident malicious behaviors or security risks. The code seems legitimate and safe for use, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
