  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of environment variables, network modules (socket, subprocess), dynamic code execution functions (eval, exec), hardcoded credentials/IPs, and obfuscated code segments.",
  "sinks": "Network communication (sending/receiving data), command execution via subprocess, dynamic code evaluation, environment variable access, file system operations.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and network modules feed into dynamic execution functions and network communication, potentially leading to data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation, use of eval/exec, dynamic code execution, network activity, hardcoded IPs/credentials, complex or convoluted code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in four reports, with no suspicious signals, consistent with low malware and obfuscation scores (0). The confidence levels are moderate to high (0.6-0.9). Report 5 shows signs of suspicious activity, including network modules, dynamic execution, and obfuscation, warranting higher suspicion scores. The malware score (0.4) and security risk (0.65) are justified by these indicators. Overall, the benign reports are correctly scored, while Report 5's suspicion is appropriately reflected in its scores.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no malicious intent, supported by low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5 indicates moderate suspicion due to signs of obfuscation and network activity, justifying higher scores. Overall, the supply chain risk is low but warrants attention to suspicious patterns in certain dependencies.",
