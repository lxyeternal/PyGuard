  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be for performing some form of data processing or system interaction, potentially related to network communication or data handling.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from environment variables, user inputs, or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands executed with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through processing functions to sinks like network sockets, system calls, or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are detected. The code uses standard constructs; no suspicious dynamic execution or obfuscated logic identified.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be straightforward, performing standard operations such as reading input, processing data, and possibly outputting results. No malicious patterns like data exfiltration, system damage, or unauthorized access are evident. The structure and style are typical of legitimate Python scripts. Absence of suspicious hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or obfuscated code suggests low malicious intent. No unusual or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard Python script. However, without full context or additional hidden logic, this assessment has low confidence.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
