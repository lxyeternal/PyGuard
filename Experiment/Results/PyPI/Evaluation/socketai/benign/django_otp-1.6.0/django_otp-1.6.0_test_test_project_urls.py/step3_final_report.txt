  "purpose": "Configure URL routing for a Django project with OTP and admin integration, mapping URLs to views and admin sites.",
  "sources": "URL patterns, imported views, and admin registration logic.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only sets up URL routes and admin registration without processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "URL patterns direct requests to views; no data flows from untrusted sources within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard Django URL configuration with OTP integration.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing necessary modules, setting up URL patterns, and registering admin models with OTP support. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The security implications are minimal, mainly related to exposure of admin and login URLs, but this is typical for web applications. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's nature. Given the lack of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, the overall assessment is that the code is safe and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django URL configuration with OTP integration, free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk reflects its configuration role, assuming views and admin implementations are secure.",
