  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code snippet is a minimal class definition with licensing comments, containing no methods, attributes, data processing, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   The reports are consistent in noting that the code is benign and straightforward. No logical errors or flaws are identified, which is appropriate given the simplicity of the snippet.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**  \n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified. The code shows no malicious intent.  \n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code is clear and unobfuscated.  \n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Risk Score Justification:**  \n   Since there's no malicious activity, no obfuscation, and no security issues, the overall risk score should be very low, ideally 0.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions and Claims:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a benign class skeleton with licensing comments.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\nThis code is a standard open-source license header and a class skeleton with no operational code. It is safe and poses no security threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe provided code snippet is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero across all categories.",
