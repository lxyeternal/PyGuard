  "purpose": "Define a base class for audio file types in the audioread library.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks occurs within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward class definition with standard licensing comments; no unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a simple class declaration with a docstring. There are no data reads, external interactions, or complex logic. The licensing comments are standard and do not contain secrets or malicious content. The class itself is empty and serves as a base class, with no malicious or suspicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project, providing a base class for audio file handling.",
