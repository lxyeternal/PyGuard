  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Presence of Issues:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal class definition with licensing comments.\n   - There are no methods, attributes, data processing, input/output operations, or network activity.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign and serves as a base class placeholder.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are apparent in these assessments.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware: 0`\n     - `securityRisk: 0`\n     - `obfuscated: 0`\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of suspicious elements.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable considering the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk or Malware Scores:**\n   - Since there is no evidence of malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation, scores higher than 0 are unwarranted.\n   - The code is purely a structural placeholder with licensing info, common in open-source projects.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they stick to observable facts.\n   - The assessments are cautious and appropriate.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code snippet is benign, with no malicious or security risks.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My Final Estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (a very low, negligible risk, mainly because the code is minimal and part of a larger project, but still worth noting as a placeholder)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, harmless class definition with licensing comments. It does not pose any security or malware concerns.",
