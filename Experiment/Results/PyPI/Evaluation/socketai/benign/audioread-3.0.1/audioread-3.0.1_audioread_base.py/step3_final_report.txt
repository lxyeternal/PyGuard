  "purpose": "This code serves as a base class for all audio file types, primarily providing a structural placeholder with licensing information.",
  "sources": "The licensing comments and class definition; no input data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, input/output, or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely structural with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with licensing comments and an empty class.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class skeleton with licensing comments, containing no methods, attributes, or executable logic. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or contain obfuscation. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The simplicity and benign nature of the code suggest it is a standard open-source placeholder. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It is a standard, straightforward class skeleton with licensing comments, posing no threat or security concern.",
