{
  "purpose": "The code provides a standard implementation for reading AIFF, WAV, and AU audio files using Python's built-in modules, handling format validation, byte order, and data extraction.",
  "sources": "File input via open file handle, data read through library functions (aifc, wave, sunau).",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed locally within the module.",
  "flows": "File is opened, validated, and data is read in chunks, with potential byte swapping based on format; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; standard resource management and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code correctly identifies and opens audio files using standard libraries, performs necessary format validation, handles endianness with byteswap, and reads data in blocks. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code is present. The security risk is minimal, related only to file handling, which is typical and not inherently dangerous. The malware score is zero, obfuscation score is zero, and the slight security risk score of 0.1 is a conservative estimate reflecting general file handling risks but no actual vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe implementation for reading audio files with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with no need for adjustments. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with standard practices.",
