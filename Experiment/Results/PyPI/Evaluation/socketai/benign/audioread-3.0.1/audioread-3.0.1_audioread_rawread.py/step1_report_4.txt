{
  "purpose": "To read AIFF, WAV, and AU audio files using Python standard libraries, providing audio data and metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a file specified by filename, opening it in binary mode and passing the file handle to audio libraries.",
  "sinks": "The code does not appear to send data externally, write to network, or handle untrusted outputs. It processes local files only.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> open file -> identify file type -> read audio frames -> process data (byte swapping, format conversion) -> yield audio data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code includes proper exception handling for unsupported formats and errors.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python modules (aifc, wave, sunau, audioop, struct) to open and process audio files. It checks file types and handles byte order conversions. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is evident. The file operations are straightforward, with appropriate exception handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The implementation appears to be a typical audio file reader module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate audio file reader using standard libraries, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. It functions solely to process local audio files for further use.",
