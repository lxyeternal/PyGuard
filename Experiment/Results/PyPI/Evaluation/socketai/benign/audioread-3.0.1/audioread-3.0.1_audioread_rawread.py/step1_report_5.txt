{
  "purpose": "To read and decode AIFF, WAV, and Au audio files using Python's standard library modules.",
  "sources": "The filename input in the constructor (__init__) method, which is used to open and process the audio file.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that send untrusted data over the network, write to system files, or perform other malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code opens a filename, attempts to identify the file type, reads audio data in chunks, possibly swaps byte order, and provides properties for metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Uses standard library modules appropriately. No embedded or hidden malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines classes for opening audio files with support for multiple formats. It checks file compatibility, handles byte order, and reads data in chunks. The flow involves opening the file, identifying its type, checking supported parameters, and reading data efficiently. No external network activity, data leaks, or suspicious operations are present. The code follows typical patterns for audio file handling without anomalies or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, well-structured implementation for reading audio files without any indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. No security risks or malware signals were detected.",
