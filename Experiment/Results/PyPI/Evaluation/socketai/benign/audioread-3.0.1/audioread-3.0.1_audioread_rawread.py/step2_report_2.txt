  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to verify the accuracy of their assessments and scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard implementation for reading audio files (AIFF, WAV, AU) using Python's standard libraries.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration is indicated.\n- The code performs typical format validation, byte swapping, and data reading.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present.\n- The only slight concern is the \"securityRisk\" scores of 0.1 in some reports, which seem to be a default or placeholder rather than indicating real risk.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues in the code:\n\n- **Are there any issues?**  \n  No. The code appears correct, well-structured, and standard for its purpose.\n\n### Logical, reasoning, or summary flaws:\n\n- **Are the reports accurate?**  \n  Yes. They correctly identify that the code is standard, with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports give 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports give 0, which is correct.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  Most reports give 0.1, which seems to be a default or minimal placeholder rather than an actual risk. Given the code's nature, the actual risk is effectively zero.  \n  **Recommendation:** Set the security risk score to 0 for all reports, as there's no real security concern.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the code or reports indicate any security risk warranting a high score.  \n- The code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and performs no malicious actions.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis—mostly zero or negligible risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**  \n- **Risk score:** **0** (since no security issues are present)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate and reasonable in their analysis. The only adjustment I recommend is to set the \"securityRisk\" scores to 0 across all reports, reflecting the true absence of security concerns.\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard, safe implementation for reading audio files, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.**",
