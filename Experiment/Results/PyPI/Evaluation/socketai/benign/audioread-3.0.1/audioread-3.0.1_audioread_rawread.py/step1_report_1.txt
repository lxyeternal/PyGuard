{
  "purpose": "The code reads AIFF, WAV, and AU audio files using standard Python library modules, providing functionality to process and extract PCM audio data.",
  "sources": "File opened in __init__ method (__fh), file parameters accessed via self._file (e.g., getsampwidth, getnchannels, getframerate, getnframes), and file data read in read_data method (self._file.readframes).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if file data or metadata are improperly exposed outside the module; however, the code primarily processes data internally without external data sinks.",
  "flows": "File is opened (__init__), file parameters are read (_check), and audio data flows through read_data() where it is read from the file, possibly byte-swapped, and yielded for processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code segments; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Use of standard library modules for audio processing is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code opens audio files with three different standard libraries, handling errors to identify unsupported formats. It performs byte swapping based on file endianness, and yields PCM data in chunks. No malicious functions, external network activity, or privacy violations are detected. The file handling and data processing are straightforward and consistent with standard audio file reading procedures. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard audio file reader utilizing Python's built-in modules. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It performs typical file format checks, data reading, and byte swapping as expected for such functionality.",
