{
  "purpose": "The code sets up pytest fixtures to load audio file specifications from local JSON files, constructing data objects for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files from the 'data' directory based on test parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; local file reading and object creation only.",
  "flows": "JSON data is loaded from files and passed into AudiofileSpec objects during test setup.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data loading and fixture setup with no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs local file I/O to load JSON specifications for audio files, constructs data objects, and uses pytest fixtures for parameterized testing. There are no external system calls, network activity, code execution based on untrusted input, or obfuscation. The data flows are limited to reading local files and creating in-memory objects. No secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The logic is simple, well-structured, and adheres to standard testing practices. Given these observations, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard test setup for loading audio file specifications with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The assigned malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
