{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to provide test fixtures for audio file specifications and load JSON data related to audio files for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads JSON files from the 'data' directory based on test parameters, and reads the 'pytest' configuration for test setup.",
  "sinks": "There are no clear sinks that could lead to data leaks or execution effects; no untrusted data is being executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "JSON data from files flows into Python objects via json.load(), used within test fixtures; no external untrusted data flows into sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual logic; the code strictly handles test setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, sets up test fixtures to load JSON files from a specified directory, and defines classes and functions for test parameterization. It handles data safely, reads static JSON files, and uses well-known testing patterns. There is no indication of malicious behavior, external data manipulation, or security issues. The code's purpose is to support testing of audio file attributes, with no security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test setup script for loading audio file specifications from JSON files. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. Its functionality is limited to safe test data handling.",
