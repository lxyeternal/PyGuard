{
  "purpose": "The code sets up testing infrastructure for audio files, loading test specifications from JSON files for pytest-based tests.",
  "sources": "The code reads JSON files from a data directory based on test parameters and loads them into Python dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no external system calls, data transmission, or sensitive data handling are observed.",
  "flows": "JSON files are loaded from disk in the 'audiofile' fixture and used to instantiate 'AudiofileSpec' objects during tests.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code appears standard for a test setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules (json, os, pytest), defines a fixture to load test data from JSON files, and sets up parameterization for test functions. It constructs file paths dynamically and loads JSON data without executing or evaluating its content beyond loading. No network operations, external command execution, or data leaks are present. The code functions as a typical testing setup with safe practices. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing setup for audio files using pytest, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It only reads local JSON files and constructs data objects for testing purposes.",
