  "purpose": "The code is designed for testing audio file processing, providing fixtures and specifications for pytest testing framework.",
  "sources": "Reading JSON files for audio specifications (spec_path = os.path.join(DATADIR, request.param + '.json'))",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no output or network communication occurs",
  "flows": "Reading JSON files -> Loading data into AudiofileSpec objects -> Providing test data via pytest fixtures",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded paths are predictable, and no dynamic or malicious code execution is present",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules (json, os, pytest), loads JSON data into AudiofileSpec objects, and uses pytest fixtures for parameterized tests. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior detected. The code handles test data setup in a straightforward manner without external or untrusted data manipulation beyond reading local JSON files. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test setup for audio file testing with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It solely loads local data and sets up test fixtures.",
