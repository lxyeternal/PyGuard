{
  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for reading audio files on macOS using CoreAudio and CoreFoundation system libraries, handling file metadata and streaming raw PCM data.",
  "sources": "Filename input, system library functions (CFURLCreateFromFileSystemRepresentation, ExtAudioFileOpenURL, ExtAudioFileRead, etc.)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; data flows from file system through system API calls to in-memory buffers, with no network or external data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Filename input -> CFURL object -> system API calls to open/read file -> data buffers -> yield audio data",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. Proper error handling and resource management are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation leveraging macOS system APIs for audio file processing. It uses ctypes to interface with system libraries, manages resources appropriately, and performs no suspicious operations. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is evident. The data flow is straightforward, with no external or untrusted data sinks beyond system calls. Error handling is consistent, and resource cleanup is properly implemented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured wrapper around macOS CoreAudio APIs for reading audio files. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should reflect this.",
