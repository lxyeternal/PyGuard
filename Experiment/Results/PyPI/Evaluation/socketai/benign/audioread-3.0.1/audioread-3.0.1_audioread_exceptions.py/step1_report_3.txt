  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for decoding errors in the audioread package.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class definitions with comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with appropriate documentation. It consists of two classes inheriting from Exception and DecodeError, respectively. There are no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs. The comments and class names are clear and typical for error handling in a Python library. No external data sources, sinks, or flow paths are present. The code appears to be legitimate and solely for error management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions for a Python package. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious anomalies.",
