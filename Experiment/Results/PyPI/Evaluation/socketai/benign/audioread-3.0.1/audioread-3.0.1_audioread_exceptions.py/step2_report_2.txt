  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code solely defines two custom exception classes: `DecodeError` and `NoBackendError`.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, external data sources, or sinks.\n   - The code contains only license comments and class definitions, with no dynamic or obfuscated code.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Security Risks:**\n   - No report indicates any suspicious code, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n   - The code is standard for error handling in Python packages.\n   - The malware score assigned in all reports is 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious patterns.\n\n3. **Obfuscation & Anomalies:**\n   - All reports note that the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or anomalies.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Scores & Justifications:**\n   - The confidence score is 1 in all reports, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable in their assessments.\n\n5. **Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n   - No issues are present; the code is a minimal, standard exception class definition.\n   - The reasoning in all reports is sound and aligns with the code content.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risk associated with this code.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.",
