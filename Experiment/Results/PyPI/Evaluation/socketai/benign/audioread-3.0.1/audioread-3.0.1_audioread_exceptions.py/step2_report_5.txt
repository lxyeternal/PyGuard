  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code only defines two exception classes (`DecodeError` and `NoBackendError`) with no data processing, input/output, or external interactions. There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly note that the code is straightforward, with no suspicious behavior, and is typical for a Python package's error handling. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature. These scores seem appropriate given the content.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:  \n   Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior, there is no justification for any risk score higher than 0.5. The reports' scores of 0 are justified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There is no malicious activity or payload.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports avoid assumptions; they only describe the code's structure and content, which is benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. All reports agree on the benign nature, and their assessments are reasonable.\n\n**Overall Conclusion**:  \nThe code is a standard, harmless definition of exception classes. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My Own Estimate:\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe code is straightforward, well-documented, and contains no suspicious or malicious elements.",
