{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for decoding errors in an audio processing package.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class and exception definitions; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard exception class definitions with clear documentation. It includes licensing comments and class inheritance without dynamic or obfuscated code. There are no inputs, outputs, or external data interactions that could be exploited. The code appears to be boilerplate for error handling, typical in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as error class definitions for the package. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks.",
