  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code content verification:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code solely defines two custom exception classes (`DecodeError` and `NoBackendError`) with associated docstrings and license comments. There are no data flows, external interactions, or complex logic. The code is static, straightforward, and typical for error handling in Python.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly note the absence of malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security risks. No report claims the code performs any data processing, external communication, or contains suspicious constructs. The assessments are appropriate.\n\n3. **Scores review:**  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate given the code's benign nature.  \n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.  \n- **Confidence scores:** All are 1 or 1.0, reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \nSince all reports agree the code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious or suspicious content, a risk score higher than 0.5 is unwarranted. The code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n5. **Malware score justification:**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \nNo report makes baseless assumptions; all are cautious and accurate.\n\n7. **Score consistency:**  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis; all are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThis code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions with no security issues. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus in the reports.",
