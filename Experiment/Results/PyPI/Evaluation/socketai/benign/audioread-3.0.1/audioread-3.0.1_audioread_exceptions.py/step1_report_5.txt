  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class and exception definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data handling or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward class declarations with no suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions for error handling. It contains licensing comments, which are common in open-source projects. No code reads input, writes output, or interacts with external data sources. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs. The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
