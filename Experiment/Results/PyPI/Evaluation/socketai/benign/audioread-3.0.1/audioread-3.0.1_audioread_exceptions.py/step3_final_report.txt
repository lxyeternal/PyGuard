  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for decoding errors in an audio processing package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only contains class definitions and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only declares exception classes without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard class definitions and license comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two exception class definitions with associated docstrings and license comments. There are no data flows, external data sources, or malicious patterns. The code is static, simple, and typical for error handling modules. No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or malicious behavior are present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, with high confidence (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and contains no malicious or security-risk elements. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
