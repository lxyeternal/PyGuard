  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and systematically.\n\n**Code Content Confirmation:**\n- The provided code only defines two custom exception classes: `DecodeError` and `NoBackendError`.\n- There are no data flows, input/output operations, external data sources, or processing logic.\n- The code includes license comments and class docstrings, standard for open-source code.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic:**\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, with no malicious behavior.\n- They correctly note the absence of data handling, external interactions, or suspicious patterns.\n- No logical flaws are evident in the reasoning; the analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n**Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n- All reports assign:\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0\n  - Confidence: 1 (or 1.0)\n- These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n- No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and justified.\n\n**Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n- Since all reports assign a risk of 0, and the code is purely defining exception classes, there is no basis for higher risk scores.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious or introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Malware Score Consideration:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- No malicious activity or intent is present.\n\n**Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n- All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they stick to observable facts.\n- The analysis correctly states that the code is standard and benign.\n\n**Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n- The scores are consistent and appropriate given the code content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0**\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nNo changes needed. The code is benign, and the current scoring reflects that accurately.",
