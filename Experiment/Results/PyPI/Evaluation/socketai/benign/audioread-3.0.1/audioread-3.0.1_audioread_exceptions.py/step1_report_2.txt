  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for decoding errors related to the audioread package.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; code contains only class definitions and comments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; classes are exception definitions with no active data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard license comments and straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of license comments and two simple exception class definitions inheriting from Exception and DecodeError. There are no functions, input handling, external data sources, or suspicious code structures. The exception classes are typical and do not include any malicious code or backdoors. The code is standard, well-structured, and typical for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as exception class definitions for the audioread package. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks are present.",
