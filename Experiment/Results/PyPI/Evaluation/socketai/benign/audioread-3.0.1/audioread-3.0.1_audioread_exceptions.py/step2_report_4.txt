  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The code in question is a straightforward definition of two custom exception classes, `DecodeError` and `NoBackendError`, with accompanying license comments and docstrings. There are no data flows, input/output operations, or external interactions. The code is standard, boilerplate, and typical for a Python package.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**  \n   The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or security risks. They note the absence of data handling, external sources, or suspicious constructs. No errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence scores are 1, reflecting certainty. The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n\n4. **Justification for higher risk scores:**  \n   Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no operational logic, no external data, and no malicious patterns, higher risk scores are unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   All reports correctly avoid speculative claims; they base their conclusions on the actual code content, which is minimal and standard.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.\n\n**Overall assessment:**  \nThe code is a standard, harmless set of exception class definitions with no security concerns. The reports are accurate and appropriately cautious, reflecting the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, just because it’s a library code, but no real risk)\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is entirely benign, with no malicious or suspicious content. The minimal risk score reflects that it's part of a package that could be used maliciously if combined with other malicious code, but on its own, it poses no threat.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate. The code is harmless, and the scores should remain at zero for malware and obfuscated, with a very low security risk score, such as 0.1, to acknowledge the context of being a library component.",
