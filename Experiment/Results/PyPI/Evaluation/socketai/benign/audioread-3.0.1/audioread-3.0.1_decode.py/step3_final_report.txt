  "purpose": "A command-line utility to decode audio files into WAV format using audioread.",
  "sources": "Filename input via command-line argument, file existence check, audioread.audio_open for decoding",
  "sinks": "Writing decoded audio frames to a WAV file in the same directory as input",
  "flows": "Input filename -> os.path.exists check -> audioread.audio_open -> reading frames -> wave.open -> writing frames to WAV",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or network activity; standard error handling and resource management",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward audio decoding with proper validation and error handling. It uses standard libraries without obfuscation or malicious code. No network activity, data leaks, or backdoors are present. The file is read, decoded, and written locally, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The logic is simple, and the security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard utility for decoding audio files with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate, though the risk could be considered very low (~0.05). Overall, it is safe for use in open-source projects.",
