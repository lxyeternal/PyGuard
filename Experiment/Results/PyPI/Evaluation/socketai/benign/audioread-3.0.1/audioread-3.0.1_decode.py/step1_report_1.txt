  "purpose": "Command-line tool to decode audio files to WAV format.",
  "sources": "Reads input filename from command-line argument and accesses the specified audio file.",
  "sinks": "Outputs informational messages to standard error; writes WAV files to disk.",
  "flows": "User provides filename -> code resolves filename path -> reads audio data from file -> writes WAV output to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Uses standard libraries and open-source modules appropriately. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution detected. No network communication or data exfiltration mechanisms present.",
  "analysis": "The script processes a user-specified audio file, decodes it using the 'audioread' library, and writes the output as a WAV file. It performs filename resolution and existence checks to prevent errors. It outputs file and decoding information but does not process or transmit untrusted data beyond standard file operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data theft, system compromise, or covert network activities. The code structure is straightforward and standard for a file conversion utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign audio file decoding tool with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It performs standard file operations with proper checks. No malware or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
