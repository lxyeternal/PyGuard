  "purpose": "A command-line tool to decode audio files to WAV format.",
  "sources": "User provides filename via command-line argument, which is expanded to an absolute path.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output WAV files; no untrusted data is written to network or external systems.",
  "flows": "User input (filename) is expanded and validated; audio data from the file is read and converted into WAV format; no external communication occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. The code properly handles file existence and decoding errors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a third-party 'audioread' library to open and decode audio files. It expands and checks the input filename, then attempts to decode it. If successful, it creates a WAV file with the same name plus '.wav', and writes the audio data into it. Error handling is in place for file not found and decode errors. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code's flow is straightforward and safe, with proper resource management.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign audio decoding utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly handles input validation and decoding errors without any suspicious behavior.",
