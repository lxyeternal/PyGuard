  "purpose": "Command-line tool to decode audio files to WAV format.",
  "sources": "Reads filename input from command-line argument and reads audio data from the file using audioread.audio_open.",
  "sinks": "Writes WAV output to a new file with '.wav' extension; no other data sinks present.",
  "flows": "User provides filename -> code checks file existence -> opens file with audioread -> reads audio data -> writes data to WAV file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. Use of standard libraries and straightforward logic. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script takes a filename as input, resolves its absolute path, and verifies existence. It then uses audioread to decode the audio file, printing info about the input file and backend used. It creates a WAV output file and writes the decoded audio frames into it. The process is linear, with error handling for decode failures. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or hidden functions observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard audio decoding utility with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It simply converts input audio files to WAV format, with appropriate error handling. No indicators of malware, data leakage, or sabotage are present.",
