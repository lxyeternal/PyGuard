  "purpose": "A command-line tool to decode audio files to WAV format.",
  "sources": "Input filename provided as a command-line argument; os.path functions to check and manipulate the filename.",
  "sinks": "Writing output WAV file to disk; printing status messages to stderr.",
  "flows": "User provides filename -> filename is validated -> audio file is opened with audioread -> decoded data is written to WAV file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or obfuscated code. The script reads and writes files but does not perform any network operations or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The script securely handles input filename validation, uses standard libraries and audioread for decoding, and writes to disk without executing untrusted code or external commands. No suspicious code paths, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. It performs straightforward audio decoding tasks. There is no indication of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate audio decoding utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign tool for converting audio files, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
