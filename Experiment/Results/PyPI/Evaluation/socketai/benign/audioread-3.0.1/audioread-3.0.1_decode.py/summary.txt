  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard utility for decoding audio files with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate, though the risk could be considered very low (~0.05). Overall, it is safe for use in open-source projects."
