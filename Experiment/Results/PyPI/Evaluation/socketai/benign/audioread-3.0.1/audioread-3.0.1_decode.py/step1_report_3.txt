  "purpose": "A command-line tool to decode audio files into WAV format.",
  "sources": "Reads input filename from command-line argument; accesses filesystem to verify file existence.",
  "sinks": "Writes decoded audio data into a new WAV file; outputs status and error messages to standard error.",
  "flows": "User provides filename -> code checks file existence -> opens file with audioread -> reads data -> writes to WAV file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious network activity, no unusual code structures or obfuscated code. Usage of standard libraries and modules. No dynamic code execution or external data fetched.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads an audio file, decodes it using the audioread library, and writes the output as a WAV file. It performs basic file existence checks, handles decode errors, and logs status messages. No untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to injection or leakage. No suspicious behavior such as network activity, credential handling, or malicious data processing is present. The code structure is straightforward and uses standard practices for file I/O and error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign audio decoding utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs simple file operations and audio decoding without any suspicious behavior.",
