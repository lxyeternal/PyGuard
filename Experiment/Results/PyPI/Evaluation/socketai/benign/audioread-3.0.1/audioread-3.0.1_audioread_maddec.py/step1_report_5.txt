{
  "purpose": "Decode MPEG audio files using the MAD library via pymad.",
  "sources": "Filename input in __init__ method, file opening with open(filename, 'rb').",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points for untrusted data leading to data leak or malicious effect.",
  "flows": "Filename input -> open file -> create MadFile object -> read data from MadFile -> yield data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; code adheres to standard library usage. No suspicious or obfuscated code features.",
  "analysis": "The code opens an audio file specified by filename, processes it with the mad library, and provides methods to read PCM data, retrieve properties like sample rate, duration, and channels. No data is sent over network or stored externally. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behaviors are present. It appears to be a straightforward implementation of an audio decoder. The open file handle is properly closed in close() and __del__, and no malicious or suspicious actions are evident. The code relies on external libraries and standard file handling without any unusual patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of an MPEG audio decoder using the mad library. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. It performs file I/O and data processing in a typical manner without suspicious activity.",
