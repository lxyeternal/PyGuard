{
  "purpose": "Decode MPEG audio files using the MAD library, providing PCM data and metadata such as sample rate, duration, and channels.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the specified filename via open() and mad.MadFile().",
  "sinks": "Outputs PCM data as bytes in read_blocks(); no external data sinks or leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Reads from file -> decodes via mad.MadFile -> yields PCM bytes; metadata accessed via properties.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The check for total_time() returning false may misinterpret silent files but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an MPEG decoder using the mad library. It manages resources properly with close(), __del__(), and context management. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behavior are present. The code does not perform any dangerous operations or contain obfuscation. The only minor concern is the use of total_time() to detect open failure, which is a benign logic check. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.1, reflecting minimal inherent risk due to file handling but no actual vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure MPEG audio decoder with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
