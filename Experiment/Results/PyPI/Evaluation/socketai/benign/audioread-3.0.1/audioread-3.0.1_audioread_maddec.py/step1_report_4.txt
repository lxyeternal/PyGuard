  "purpose": "Decode MPEG audio files using the MAD library via pymad, providing properties and methods to access audio metadata and PCM data.",
  "sources": "Reading input file via open(filename, 'rb'); calling mad.MadFile with file object; accessing self.mf.total_time(), self.mf.samplerate(), self.mf.mode(), and self.mf.read() methods.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written or transmitted; no data leaks or insecure sinks detected.",
  "flows": "File input stream -> mad.MadFile object -> methods accessing total_time, samplerate, mode, read() -> yielding PCM bytes or returning metadata properties.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets observed. The code strictly handles file input, audio decoding, and property access with no hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party library 'mad' for audio decoding, opens a file in binary mode, and uses the library to decode MPEG audio. It performs basic error checking on total_time to verify successful decoding. Methods expose metadata (duration, sample rate, channels) and read PCM data in chunks. The destructor and context manager ensure cleanup. No suspicious code, network activity, or malicious patterns detected. The code appears standard and straightforward for an audio decoding module, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard audio decoding implementation with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. It handles files securely and correctly without suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
