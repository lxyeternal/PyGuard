{
  "purpose": "Decode MPEG audio files using the MAD library via pymad, providing an interface to read audio data and metadata.",
  "sources": "Filename input provided to the constructor (__init__).",
  "sinks": "Data read from the file descriptor (self.fp), but only for legitimate decoding purposes; no data is written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Filename input -> open file -> pass file object to mad.MadFile -> read data blocks from MadFile -> return PCM data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Usage of standard libraries and file handling without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes by opening a specified file for reading in binary mode, then passes this file object to the mad.MadFile class for decoding. It provides properties for retrieving audio metadata such as sample rate, duration, and channels. The read_blocks generator yields PCM data read from the decoder. Proper resource cleanup is handled via close() and __del__ methods. No suspicious external network activity, code injection, or malicious data handling is observed. Usage of the mad library appears standard and intended solely for decoding audio files. No hardcoded secrets, environment variable misuse, or obfuscated code features are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an MPEG audio decoder utilizing the mad library. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. It safely reads and decodes audio files without external data transmission or hidden functionalities.",
