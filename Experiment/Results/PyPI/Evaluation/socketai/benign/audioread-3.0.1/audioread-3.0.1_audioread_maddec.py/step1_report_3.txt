{
  "purpose": "Decode MPEG audio files using the MAD library via pymad.",
  "sources": "The filename input parameter used to open and read the audio file.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data affects external systems; file reading occurs locally.",
  "flows": "Filename input -> open file -> create mad.MadFile instance -> read blocks -> process properties.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code; uses standard library functions and third-party dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code opens a specified filename in binary mode, creates a MadFile object, and provides methods for reading PCM data, retrieving properties like sample rate, duration, and channels. It performs error handling if the file cannot be opened or parsed. No untrusted data flow leads to external systems or malicious operations. The dependencies (mad library) are used as intended. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a legitimate MPEG audio decoder using the MAD library. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified. It operates within expected parameters for a media decoding library.",
