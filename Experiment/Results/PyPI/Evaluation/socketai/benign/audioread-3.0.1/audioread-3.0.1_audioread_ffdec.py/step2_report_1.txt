  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages subprocesses to run ffmpeg, handles threading for stdout/stderr, parses ffmpeg output for audio info, and manages errors. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the conclusion.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; the code is standard for audio decoding, with no malicious indicators. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing subprocess management, threading, and parsing ffmpeg output, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — still low, considering the code's purpose.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the reasoning is consistent, and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard wrapper around ffmpeg, managing subprocesses and streams, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no apparent security concern.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code's behavior; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on subprocess management, stream handling, and parsing, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with benign code.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound; scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard ffmpeg wrapper with no suspicious behaviors, data leaks, or malicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — low risk, consistent with the code's purpose.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is appropriate; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected in any report.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is justified given the benign nature of the code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), which is reasonable considering the code's function and the low likelihood of supply chain risk.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, consistent across all reports.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's purpose and no malicious indicators, a score of 0.1–0.2 is appropriate, possibly even lower if we consider the code is a well-understood wrapper around a trusted external tool.\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, primarily due to dependency on external tools (ffmpeg), which are generally trusted but could be compromised in supply chain.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, benign implementation for audio decoding via ffmpeg, with no security risks or malicious intent.",
