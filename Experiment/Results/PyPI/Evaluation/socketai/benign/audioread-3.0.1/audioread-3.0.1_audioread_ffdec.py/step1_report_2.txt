{
  "purpose": "This code provides functionality to read audio data from files using the ffmpeg command-line utility, managing subprocesses, threading, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads input filename for decoding, and captures stderr output of ffmpeg subprocess.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs error messages or diagnostic info from ffmpeg stderr; does not send data externally.",
  "flows": "Input filename -> ffmpeg subprocess -> stdout for audio data / stderr for info -> parsed in _get_info() -> potentially raised errors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Uses subprocess and threading in a standard manner. No malicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "analysis": "The code interfaces with ffmpeg to decode audio files, manages subprocesses with error handling, and employs threads to read stdout/stderr streams. It performs standard operations: detecting ffmpeg availability, parsing output info, and handling errors. No evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage is detected; it follows typical patterns for subprocess management and audio data streaming. No suspicious network activity, data leaks, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears legitimate and solely focused on audio decoding via ffmpeg, with proper error handling and process management. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code fragment.",
