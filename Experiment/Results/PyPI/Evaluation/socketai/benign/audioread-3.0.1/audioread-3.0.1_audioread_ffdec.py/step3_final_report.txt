  "purpose": "A wrapper around ffmpeg to decode audio files by managing subprocesses, threading, and parsing ffmpeg output for audio metadata.",
  "sources": "Filename input passed to subprocess call, ffmpeg stderr and stdout streams.",
  "sinks": "Parsing ffmpeg output for duration, sample rate, channels; no untrusted data sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Filename input → subprocess call → ffmpeg process → stdout/stderr streams → parsing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code manages subprocesses for ffmpeg, handles threading for stdout/stderr, parses output for audio info, and manages errors. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The filename input is passed directly to ffmpeg, which could pose command injection if untrusted, but this is a common pattern and not inherently malicious. The subprocess management and error handling are standard. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for audio decoding via ffmpeg with no detected malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, primarily considering potential command injection if filename input is untrusted, but no malicious intent is evident.",
