{
  "purpose": "This code manages audio decoding backends and provides functions to check system support and open audio files using available libraries.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the `path` parameter in `audio_open`, import statements, and system library checks (`ctypes.util.find_library`).",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the return of audio file objects from backend classes, which are instantiated with the input `path`. No untrusted data is explicitly leaked or sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input `path` flows into backend class constructors in `audio_open`, which attempt to open audio files. The system support checks (_gst_available, _ca_available, _mad_available) do not handle external data, only system libraries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed. The backend selection process is based on system library availability. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code apparent.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically checks for system support and available libraries for audio decoding. It caches available backends and provides a function to open audio files with those backends. The import logic and system checks rely on standard modules (`ctypes`, `gi`) and common practices. No data exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code detected. The code appears solely to manage media backend selection and usage, following typical patterns for such tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, system-compatible backend manager for audio decoding, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs system checks and loads files via available backends without any suspicious activity.",
