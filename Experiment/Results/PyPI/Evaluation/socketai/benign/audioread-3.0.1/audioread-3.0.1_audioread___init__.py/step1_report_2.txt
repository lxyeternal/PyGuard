{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to detect available audio decoding backends and open audio files using those backends.",
  "sources": "Reading system libraries with ctypes.util.find_library, importing modules (gi, mad), and dynamic backend detection.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data output or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements and availability checks lead to appending backend classes; audio_open iterates over backends to open files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The dynamic backend detection and import mechanisms are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs system capability checks, dynamic imports, and runtime backend selection for audio decoding. It does not contain obfuscated code or malicious instructions. The use of ctypes to find libraries and dynamic imports are typical for cross-platform compatibility. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected. The code functions as a standard audio backend loader with safe practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious component of an audio decoding library. No malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks are evident based on the provided source. It solely performs system checks, backend detection, and file opening routines.",
