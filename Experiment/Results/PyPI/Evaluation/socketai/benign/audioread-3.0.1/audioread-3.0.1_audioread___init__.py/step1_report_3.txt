{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to provide a cross-platform, multi-library framework for decoding audio files, selecting appropriate backends based on system availability.",
  "sources": "The code reads system libraries (ctypes.util.find_library), imports modules (gi, mad, ffdec, etc.), and receives input via the `path` parameter in `audio_open()`.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the `path` parameter which is used to open files, but no data is directly sent elsewhere or leaked.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking system capabilities, caching available backends, and attempting to open files with those backends in sequence.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. All imports and system checks appear standard for functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code performs system checks for libraries and components, caches backend availability, and attempts to open audio files with multiple decoders. The process is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious data handling. It only performs legitimate library checks, module imports, and file opening attempts based on system capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation for managing multiple audio decoding backends. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are detected. It relies on system libraries and handles audio files safely without any signs of malware or security risks.",
