{
  "purpose": "This code is part of an audio decoding library that detects available backends and opens audio files using the appropriate backend.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports, function parameters (`path`, `backends`), and library availability checks.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks that handle untrusted data leading to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "The flow involves checking backend availability, selecting appropriate backends, and attempting to open audio files with them.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. All imports and functions appear standard and relevant to audio processing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection (e.g., checking for GStreamer, CoreAudio, MAD, FFmpeg) to determine available audio backends. It caches results for efficiency and attempts to open audio files with these backends. No untrusted data is processed directly in a way that could lead to security issues. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network connections or data exfiltration, is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard component of an open-source audio processing library. It performs system checks and manages backend selection without any suspicious or malicious code. There are no signs of malware, data leaks, or security risks within this module.",
