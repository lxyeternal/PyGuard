{
  "purpose": "This code is part of an audio decoding library that detects available backends and opens audio files using the available decoders.",
  "sources": "The code reads system libraries via ctypes.util.find_library, imports modules and classes within the package, and accesses system-specific audio backend availability functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks that process untrusted input data beyond opening files with backend classes, which are expected to handle their own validation.",
  "flows": "The flow involves detecting system capabilities (_gst_available, _ca_available, _mad_available), caching available backends, and attempting to open audio files with each backend class.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The use of standard library functions and straightforward backend detection is normal. No hidden network calls or system modifications are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs system capability checks using standard libraries and imports, maintains a cache of available backends, and attempts to open audio files via these backends. The approach is standard and includes no suspicious or malicious behavior. All functions are related to system checks, cache management, and safe file opening routines. No external network activity, credential handling, or data exfiltration code is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical, benign component of an audio decoding library that detects available system backends and attempts to open audio files accordingly. No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident.",
