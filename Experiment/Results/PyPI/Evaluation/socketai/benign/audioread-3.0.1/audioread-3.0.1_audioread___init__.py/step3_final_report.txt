  "purpose": "Detects system capabilities and manages backend audio decoding modules for cross-platform support.",
  "sources": "System library detection functions (_gst_available, _ca_available, _mad_available), import statements, and the path parameter in audio_open.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data output or data leaks.",
  "flows": "System detection functions determine available backends; audio_open attempts to instantiate backend classes with the provided path.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard system capability detection and manages backend modules for audio decoding. It uses typical system libraries and safe import practices. The backend selection and caching are straightforward. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or obfuscation is present. The functions are designed for environment detection and safe file opening. No untrusted data handling beyond passing the path to backend classes, which are expected to handle validation. Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and free of security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for backend detection and audio file opening. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting system checks without security implications.",
