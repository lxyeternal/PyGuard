  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of session timeout middleware. It performs expected functions without malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (around 0.2), reflecting typical session management concerns. The high confidence scores are justified by the straightforward, well-understood logic."
