  "purpose": "Implement a Django middleware to manage session expiration based on total session age or inactivity, redirecting users upon expiration.",
  "sources": "Session data stored in request.session, configuration settings from django.conf.settings, current time via time.time().",
  "sinks": "request.session.flush() (session reset), redirect() and redirect_to_login() (user redirection).",
  "flows": "Session timestamp is set or retrieved from session; expiration is checked against current time; upon expiration, session is flushed and user is redirected; inactivity updates timestamp if configured.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django middleware for session timeout management. It reads session data and configuration, checks for expiration based on absolute age or inactivity, flushes session data, and redirects users accordingly. The logic is straightforward, using common Django functions, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The session timestamp is stored in session data, and expiration logic is based on configurable settings. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of session timeout middleware. It performs expected functions without malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (around 0.2), reflecting typical session management concerns. The high confidence scores are justified by the straightforward, well-understood logic.",
