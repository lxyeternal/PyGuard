{
  "purpose": "This code implements session timeout management middleware for Django applications, handling session expiration based on inactivity or total session age.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration settings from django.conf.settings and session data from request.session.",
  "sinks": "Calls request.session.flush(), redirects via redirect() and redirect_to_login(), potentially affecting user sessions and navigation.",
  "flows": "Session age or inactivity triggers session flush and redirects; session timestamp is updated periodically based on inactivity grace period.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Uses standard Django functions. No obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if the session has expired based on total session age or inactivity. If expired, it flushes the session and redirects the user. It updates the session timestamp if inactivity threshold is exceeded. No external network communication or sensitive data handling is present. The code follows standard practices for session timeout handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of session timeout middleware for Django without malicious intent or security issues. It manages user sessions securely and correctly based on configuration settings.",
