  "purpose": "Middleware to handle session timeout and redirect after inactivity or expiration.",
  "sources": "Reads session data (request.session), reads settings (settings.*), reads current time (time.time()).",
  "sinks": "Redirects using redirect() and redirect_to_login(), modifies request.session.",
  "flows": "Reads session init time -> Checks expiration -> Flushes session and redirects if expired -> Updates session timeout timestamp on activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated logic. Uses standard Django session handling and settings. No suspicious network activity or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a session timeout middleware that resets the session timestamp and redirects users upon session expiration. It utilizes standard Django functions and settings, with no evident malicious logic. No external data or network communication is involved, and the code performs expected session management tasks without hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard session timeout middleware with no malicious behavior. It manages user sessions securely by flushing expired sessions and redirecting appropriately. No malicious or suspicious actions detected.",
