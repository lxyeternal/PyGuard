  "purpose": "Middleware to handle session timeout based on inactivity or absolute expiration.",
  "sources": "request.session, settings attributes (SESSION_EXPIRE_SECONDS, SESSION_TIMEOUT_REDIRECT, SESSION_EXPIRE_AFTER_LAST_ACTIVITY, SESSION_EXPIRE_AFTER_LAST_ACTIVITY_GRACE_PERIOD), time.time()",
  "sinks": "redirect(), request.session.flush(), request.session[SESSION_TIMEOUT_KEY]",
  "flows": "Request session data -> Check expiration -> Possibly flush session and redirect -> Update session timestamp based on activity",
  "anomalies": "Use of time.time() for session management without additional security checks; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution; straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a session timeout mechanism that tracks session initialization time and expiration based on absolute timeout or last activity. It reads data from the request.session object and Django settings, then performs expiration checks and redirects accordingly. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data exfiltration. The logic appears standard for session management and security. No external network calls, no suspicious code injection, or privacy violations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard session timeout middleware with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It handles session expiration securely and does not introduce any apparent security risks beyond typical session management. No malware or malicious anomalies detected.",
