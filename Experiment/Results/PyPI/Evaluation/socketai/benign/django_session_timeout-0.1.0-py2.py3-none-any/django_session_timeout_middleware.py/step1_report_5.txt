{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Django middleware that manages user session timeout behavior based on inactivity or absolute expiration time.",
  "sources": "Request session attributes (request.session), settings (settings.*), current time (time.time())",
  "sinks": "Session flush (request.session.flush), redirects (redirect, redirect_to_login)",
  "flows": "Request session data (initial timestamp) → expiration check → session flush or redirect based on timeout → update last activity timestamp",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no suspicious network activity or data leaks; straightforward session management logic",
  "analysis": "The middleware checks for session expiration based on absolute timeout or activity-based timeout. It uses standard Django session and redirect functions. There are no indications of malicious data handling, backdoors, or unauthorized data exfiltration. The code's purpose aligns with session timeout management without any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard session timeout middleware for Django, with no malicious behavior detected. It correctly manages session expiration and user redirection without any signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
