{
  "purpose": "Middleware to handle session timeout and redirect users upon expiration",
  "sources": "Reads session data (request.session), reads settings (settings.SESSION_EXPIRE_SECONDS, settings.SESSION_TIMEOUT_REDIRECT, etc.), reads current time (time.time())",
  "sinks": "Redirects to login or custom URL using redirect() and redirect_to_login() functions, potentially flushes session data",
  "flows": "Request session data → Checks expiration time → If expired, flushes session and redirects → Otherwise updates last activity timestamp",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns; uses standard Django middleware structure and session handling",
  "analysis": "The code implements a session timeout middleware that checks if a user session has expired based on a timestamp stored in the session data. It reads configuration settings for expiration time and redirection URLs, and updates the last activity timestamp if configured to do so. No untrusted input handling or insecure data processing is present. The use of standard Django functions and no obfuscated or malicious code constructs suggests benign behavior. The session management logic aligns with typical practices, with no signs of malicious behavior or data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard session timeout handler with no indicators of malicious activity or sabotage. It does not perform any malicious actions such as data theft, network communication to suspicious domains, or backdoor operations.",
