  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to verify the accuracy of their conclusions and the appropriateness of their scores.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no input sources, data flows, or output sinks in the code.\n   - No suspicious or malicious constructs are present.\n   - The code is minimal and standard for version declaration.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - No factual inaccuracies or logical flaws are evident. Each report correctly states that the code is benign and standard.\n   - The assessments are consistent across reports, emphasizing the lack of anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1 (or 1.0)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0, and there's no evidence of malicious activity, this is justified.\n   - The malware score is also 0, aligning with the benign assessment.\n   - No reason exists to elevate these scores based on the evidence.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a standard version string assignment.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the analysis provided.\n   - The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a straightforward, standard version declaration with no input, output, or suspicious constructs. The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
