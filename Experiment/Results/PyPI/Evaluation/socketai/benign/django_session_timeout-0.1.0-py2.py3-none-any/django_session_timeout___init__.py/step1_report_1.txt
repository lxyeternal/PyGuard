  "purpose": "Define the version of the package or module",
  "sources": "Assignment of string to __version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations",
  "flows": "None, as the code only assigns a static string",
  "anomalies": "Lack of any input validation, dynamic code, or obfuscated content; only simple variable assignment",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal declaration setting the __version__ attribute to '0.1.0'. It contains no input handling, no data flows, and no suspicious constructs. No embedded malicious behavior or malicious code is present. The code appears to serve a standard purpose of versioning in a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as a version identifier with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
