  "purpose": "The code assigns a version string to the __version__ variable, serving as a standard version identifier in Python packages.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment of a string to __version__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the assignment is static and isolated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward, minimal version declaration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a static string to __version__, with no input handling, data processing, or external communication. All reviews correctly identify it as benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated code. There are no suspicious constructs, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious behaviors. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving a standard purpose in Python packaging. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behaviors are present. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent. No modifications or further investigations are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
