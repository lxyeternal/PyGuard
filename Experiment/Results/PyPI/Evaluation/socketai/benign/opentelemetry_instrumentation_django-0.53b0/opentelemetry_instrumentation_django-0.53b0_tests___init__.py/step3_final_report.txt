  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, file reads, network calls, data processing functions, input data variables.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file output, system commands, environment variables, data storage.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data to sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected; no backdoors or malicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets and context indicate benign data processing with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. Confidence levels are high where code is present, and zero where code is absent. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are identified, and the analysis aligns with the low malware and obfuscation scores. The security risk remains low, justified by the lack of suspicious activity, with some conservative margin due to limited context in certain reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears safe with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The supply chain security risk is minimal, and the current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
