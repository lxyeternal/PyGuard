  "review": "Let's review each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code snippets are simple, static variable definitions with license headers.\n- No dynamic code, no external input, no network activity, and no obfuscated patterns.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign and serves as configuration/setup.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues are present in the code. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis. They correctly identify the benign nature and the lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Malware: 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign assessment.\n  - Obfuscated: 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n  - Security risk: 0, as there's no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **risk scores** are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- The **malware scores** are 0, which is justified.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- The **confidence levels** are all 1, reflecting certainty about benignity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The code snippets are minimal configuration variables, with no behavior that could be malicious.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and aligns with the code content.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem appropriate; no changes are necessary.\n- The reports are thorough and correctly interpret the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the code and reports, I agree with the assigned scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Additional note:** If I were to assign a **malware score** based solely on this code, I would also keep it at 0. The code is purely configuration, with no malicious logic. The **obfuscated score** remains at 0 due to clarity.\n\n**In conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No security concerns are present in this snippet.",
