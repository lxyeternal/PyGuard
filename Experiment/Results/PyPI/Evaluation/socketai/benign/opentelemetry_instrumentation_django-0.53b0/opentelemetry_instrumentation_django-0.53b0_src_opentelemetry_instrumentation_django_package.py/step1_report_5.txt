  "purpose": "Define compatibility and support features for OpenTelemetry instrumentation in Django.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static configuration variables (_instruments, _supports_metrics).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; purely static variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of license comments and two simple variable assignments; no anomalies or suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only license comments and two variables indicating instrument compatibility and metrics support. There are no dynamic or potentially unsafe operations, no data input handling, no external network calls, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a standard, benign configuration snippet for a Python package. No malicious patterns or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration fragment, serving to specify instrumentation compatibility and metrics support. It poses no security threats or malicious behavior.",
