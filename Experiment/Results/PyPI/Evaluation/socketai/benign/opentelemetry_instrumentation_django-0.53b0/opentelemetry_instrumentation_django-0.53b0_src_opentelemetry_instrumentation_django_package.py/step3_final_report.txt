  "sources": "Assignment of static variables (_instruments, _supports_metrics). No external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or data leaks; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of dynamic code, external data handling, or obfuscation; standard license header.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static configuration snippet with no dynamic behavior, external input, or malicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code's simplicity and static nature support the conclusion of safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as safe. No further action or scoring adjustments are necessary.",
