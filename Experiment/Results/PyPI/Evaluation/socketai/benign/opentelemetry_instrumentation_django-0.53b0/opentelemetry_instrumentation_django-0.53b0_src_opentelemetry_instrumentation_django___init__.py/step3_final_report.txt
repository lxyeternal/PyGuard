{
  "purpose": "Django instrumentation for tracing and metrics collection, with optional SQL comment enrichment and configurable request hooks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, Django settings, request attributes, HTTP headers",
  "sinks": "Middleware list modification, setting of tracing and metrics objects, hooks invocation",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence middleware insertion; hooks and settings are configured at instrumentation time",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard instrumentation module for Django, enabling observability features. It reads configuration from environment variables, modifies Django's middleware list, and sets up tracing and metrics objects. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The dynamic middleware insertion is typical for instrumentation libraries. The reliance on environment variables poses a configuration risk but is common practice and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, well-structured Django instrumentation for OpenTelemetry, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The low risk score reflects potential misconfiguration in a compromised environment but does not indicate active malicious intent. The malware and obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the code's clarity and purpose.",
