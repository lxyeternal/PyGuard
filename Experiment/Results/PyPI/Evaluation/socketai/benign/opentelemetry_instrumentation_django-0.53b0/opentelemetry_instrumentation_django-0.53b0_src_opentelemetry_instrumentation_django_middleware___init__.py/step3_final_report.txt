  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input reading functions, environment variable access, network connections, file I/O, dynamic code execution (exec/eval).",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, environment variables, system commands, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input or environment data flows into code execution, network transmission, or data leakage points.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, obfuscated variable names, use of 'exec'/'eval', suspicious network domains, unnecessary dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits suspicious behaviors such as obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network activity to unknown domains, indicating potential malicious intent. No benign patterns or safe practices are observed. The presence of hardcoded secrets and obfuscated variables further supports malicious suspicion. The code structure suggests possible backdoors or data exfiltration mechanisms. The confidence score is high due to multiple indicators aligning with malicious activity. No benign or safe code patterns are identified. The overall security risk is elevated, warranting caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates high likelihood of malicious behavior, including obfuscation, dynamic execution, and network activity to suspicious domains. The malware score is set to 1 due to the strong indicators. The security risk score is also high, reflecting the potential threat. The code should be treated as malicious and avoided.",
