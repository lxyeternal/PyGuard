  "purpose": "This code serves as metadata for the package, including licensing information and version declaration.",
  "sources": "Static comments and the version string assignment",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process input or output data",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment and comments only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and static",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version string assignment, with no functions, data processing, network interactions, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify it as benign, static metadata. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as static metadata with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current security assessment scores are accurate and should remain at zero.",
