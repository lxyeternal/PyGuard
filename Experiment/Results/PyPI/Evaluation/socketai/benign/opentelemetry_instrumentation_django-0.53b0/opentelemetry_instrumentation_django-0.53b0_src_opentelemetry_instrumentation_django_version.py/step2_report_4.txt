  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Reports 1-5 Summary:**\n- All reports identify the code as a license header and version declaration.\n- They correctly note that the code is static, contains no input/output, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns.\n- All assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n- The confidence in each assessment is 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity and static nature of the code.\n\n**Confirmations and Evaluations:**\n- The code snippets are straightforward license comments and a version string assignment.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks is present.\n- The reports' conclusions are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only point to consider is whether any hidden or malicious code could be embedded in comments or in the version string. However, given the content, this is highly unlikely.\n- Since the code is purely metadata, the risk scores are appropriately low.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0. There is no indication of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate for static license and version info.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My Final Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is benign, standard for open-source projects, and contains no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores and reasoning are consistent with the code's nature.",
