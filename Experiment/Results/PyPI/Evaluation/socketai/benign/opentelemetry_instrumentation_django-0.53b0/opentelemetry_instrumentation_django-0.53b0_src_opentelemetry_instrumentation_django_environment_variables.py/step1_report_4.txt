  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; simple assignment statement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and contains only comments and a variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a single assignment of a constant string to a variable. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external data sources, and no suspicious code behavior. The license comments are standard and do not influence runtime behavior. The variable assignment is harmless and typical for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration constant definition with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
