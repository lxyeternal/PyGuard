  "purpose": "Define a constant environment variable name for OpenTelemetry Django instrumentation configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it is a static variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward license header followed by a single variable assignment of a string constant. It contains no input, external data, or complex logic. All reports correctly identify it as benign configuration code. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are observed. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard configuration constant with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and no further action is necessary.",
