  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue present?** Yes. It's just a variable assignment, which is benign.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No, the reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. These are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- **Conclusion:** Correctly identified as benign.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue present?** Yes. Similar to Report 1, it's a simple string assignment.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No, the reasoning is accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue present?** Yes. Again, a straightforward constant assignment.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No, reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue present?** Yes. Same pattern—simple constant assignment.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue present?** Yes. Consistent with others—just a variable assignment.\n- **Errors or flaws?** No.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0. Correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. The code snippets are simple configuration constants with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n\n### Final thoughts:\nGiven the uniformity and benign nature of all snippets, I agree with the assessments. No changes are necessary.\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, these are safe, standard configuration constants with no security concerns.**",
