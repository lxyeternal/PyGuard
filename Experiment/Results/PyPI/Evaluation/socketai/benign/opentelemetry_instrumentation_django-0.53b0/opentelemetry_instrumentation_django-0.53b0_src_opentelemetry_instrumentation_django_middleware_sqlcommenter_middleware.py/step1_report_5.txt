  "purpose": "Middleware for appending context-related comments to database SQL queries in a Django application, mainly for debugging and tracing.",
  "sources": "Request object (self.request), Django settings, SQL query object (sql), database connection context.",
  "sinks": "Execution of SQL queries via the execute function, appending comments to SQL strings.",
  "flows": "Request -> _QueryWrapper.__call__ -> _add_sql_comment -> execute SQL",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. Use of standard libraries and instrumentation utilities. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a middleware class that wraps database query executions to add comments containing contextual information such as framework version, controller, route, app name, and OpenTelemetry data. It reads input data from Django request objects, settings, and database connection contexts. The SQL query is modified via _add_sql_comment, which injects metadata as comments. These modifications are purely for debugging and tracing purposes. No external network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The code relies on standard libraries, and the logic appears transparent and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a debugging and telemetry middleware for Django database queries. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on its functionality and context. No suspicious activity or malicious intent is evident.",
