{
  "purpose": "Defines various data classes representing Kubernetes API objects, status messages, and related structures for use in a Python client or server implementation.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, datetime, and local modules; class definitions with attributes. No external data sources or user input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data such as network transmission, file writing, or command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to data class instantiations and attribute assignments; no code execution or data processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is autogenerated, with a comprehensive set of class definitions; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution present. The 'autogenerated' comment suggests this is a generated schema, not malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data class definitions modeling Kubernetes API objects, including metadata, status, and resource descriptors. It imports standard Python modules and local modules without executing or transforming data in suspicious ways. There are no functions, network calls, or data processing logic that could be malicious. The structure and content align with standard schema definitions for a client or SDK. The presence of type annotations and dataclass usage indicates typical schema modeling. No signs of code injection, data leaks, or hidden backdoors are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of autogenerated data classes representing Kubernetes API schemas. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured and appears to be a standard schema definition used in a client or server SDK. The likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.",
