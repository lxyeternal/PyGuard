{
  "purpose": "This module defines data classes for Kubernetes API resource metadata, list handling, status reporting, and related structures, primarily for internal API communication and resource management.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from type annotations, class constructors, and default values for the data classes, mainly for object initialization and serialization/deserialization.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network calls, file operations, or command executions present in this code. It is purely data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "The code flows involve creating instances of data classes with data from external sources (e.g., API requests), but no direct processing or untrusted data handling is evident within this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic, are present. The code relies on standard data classes and type annotations for structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of data class definitions representing Kubernetes API objects and related metadata. There are no functions performing operations, no data processing, or code injection mechanisms. All fields are standard API resource attributes with proper optionality. No external data sources or sink points are present. The code appears to be part of an SDK or client library to interact with Kubernetes, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only type-safe data class definitions for Kubernetes API objects, with no malicious intent, no external data handling, and no suspicious logic. It appears to be safe and standard for API data modeling.",
