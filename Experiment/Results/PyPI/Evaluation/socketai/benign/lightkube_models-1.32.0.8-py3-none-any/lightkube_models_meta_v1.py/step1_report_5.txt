{
  "purpose": "The code defines data classes for Kubernetes API objects and related structures used for API discovery, resource management, and status reporting.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, type annotations, and imports from standard library modules and internal modules. No user input or external data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No functions, external calls, or data sinks are present that could process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from external sources to sinks; the code primarily declares data structures without processing untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code, is present. The code appears to be straightforward data class definitions with proper type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of Python data classes modeling Kubernetes API objects, including metadata, status, resource descriptions, and discovery structures. It imports standard modules like datetime and typing, and internal modules such as '_schema' and 'runtime'. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or input processing occurs within this code snippet. The presence of type hints and comments indicates clear intent for data modeling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The structure is static, well-organized, and consistent with typical API schema definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured set of data class definitions for Kubernetes API representations. It does not contain malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It functions purely as a data schema module with no external or dynamic operations.",
