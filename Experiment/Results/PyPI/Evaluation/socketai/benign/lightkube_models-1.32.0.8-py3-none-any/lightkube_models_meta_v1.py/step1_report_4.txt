{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for Kubernetes API resources, status, and metadata with type annotations and default values.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; data is primarily defined through class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network connections, or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to data structure initialization and type definitions without untrusted data processing or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns identified. Code is autogenerated, with extensive comments and annotations; no obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises mostly data class definitions for Kubernetes API objects, such as ObjectMeta, Status, OwnerReference, etc. It uses type annotations and optional fields. No runtime code execution, input handling, or external data processing is present. No indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be a standard open-source schema module, likely autogenerated from Kubernetes API specifications, with no suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of data model definitions for Kubernetes API resources, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and typical for its purpose.",
