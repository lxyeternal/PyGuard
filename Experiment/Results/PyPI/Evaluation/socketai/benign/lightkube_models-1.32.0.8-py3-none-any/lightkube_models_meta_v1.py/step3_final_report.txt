{
  "purpose": "This code defines a set of Python data classes modeling Kubernetes API objects, including metadata, status, resource descriptors, and related components, primarily for serialization/deserialization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from static class definitions, type annotations, and docstrings; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or security effects; the code is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows or external data processing are present; the code only establishes data schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are detected; the code is straightforward and autogenerated.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of autogenerated Python data classes representing Kubernetes API objects, with detailed docstrings and type annotations. It contains no executable logic, external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The absence of hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns indicates that the code's purpose is schema definition for API communication. The structure and content are consistent with standard Kubernetes client SDKs or internal API layers, and there are no signs of sabotage or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, autogenerated schema module for Kubernetes API objects, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores should reflect this: malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, security risk score 0.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
