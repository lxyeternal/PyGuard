{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for Kubernetes authorization and access review objects, primarily for API interaction and validation.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, internal modules (_schema, meta_v1), and class definitions with default values. No external data input points are apparent.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks that process untrusted external input or send data to external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class instantiations with optional fields to potential API serialization, but no explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code. It mainly consists of data class definitions with descriptive comments. No unusual code constructs or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of data classes representing various Kubernetes authorization review objects. It uses standard Python typing, data class syntax, and optional fields. The classes include documentation and are designed for serialization/deserialization purposes. There are no functions, external data processing, or code execution components that could be exploited. The code appears to serve as a schema or model layer, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of data model definitions for Kubernetes authorization objects. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious logic, and no external data handling that would pose security risks. It appears safe and purely declarative.",
