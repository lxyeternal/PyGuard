{
  "purpose": "This code defines data classes modeling Kubernetes authorization review objects, serving as schema or API data models with embedded security considerations.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules such as ._schema and meta_v1, and defines class attributes; no external input or data flow occurs within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute code at runtime.",
  "flows": "The data flows are limited to class instantiation and attribute assignment; no active data flow or processing logic is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward, autogenerated schema definitions with comprehensive documentation highlighting security considerations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Python @dataclass definitions modeling Kubernetes authorization review objects, with no functions, input handling, or dynamic code execution. The embedded docstrings emphasize security issues related to rawSelector and requirements fields to prevent CVE-2022-2880, but these are only documentation and do not influence runtime behavior. The import statements are standard, and no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are consistent with the code's static, schema-like nature. Overall, the code is a safe, well-documented data model with no active security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, autogenerated schema for Kubernetes authorization objects, with explicit security considerations documented but no active vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The assigned low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal risk score reflects the code's static, declarative nature.",
