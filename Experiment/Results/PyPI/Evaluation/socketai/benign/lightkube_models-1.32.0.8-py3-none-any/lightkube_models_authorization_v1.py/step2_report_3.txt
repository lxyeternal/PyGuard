  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of data class definitions modeling Kubernetes authorization review objects.\n- It imports internal modules such as `._schema` and `meta_v1`, but no external data input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The classes include detailed docstrings emphasizing security considerations, especially around `rawSelector` and `requirements` fields, referencing CVE-2022-2880.\n- There are no functions, executable code, or suspicious patterns.\n- The code appears autogenerated, serving as a schema or API data model.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are issues present?**  \n  No, the code is purely structural with no evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or code injection.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The code is well-structured, with comprehensive docstrings highlighting security considerations. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident.\n\n- **Scores given in reports:**\n  - Malware: 0 in all reports.\n  - Obfuscated: 0 in all reports.\n  - Security risk: Very low (mostly 0.1 to 0.2), justified by the detailed security considerations in docstrings.\n  - Confidence levels are high, indicating the reviewers agree on the safety of this code.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The references to CVE-2022-2880 and the emphasis on not setting both `rawSelector` and `requirements` are good security practices. These are documented recommendations, not active vulnerabilities.\n- No dynamic or malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, and no suspicious patterns.\n\n### Justification of risk and malware scores:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is appropriate. No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate. The code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Given the nature of the code (data schemas), a low risk score (~0.1) is justified. The only potential concern is misusage, but the detailed docstrings mitigate this.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the code content and the detailed analysis in reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0.2, but 0.1 is reasonable given the documentation and no active vulnerabilities)\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe, well-documented, and standard for its purpose.**\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to potential misuse if misconfigured, but no active vulnerabilities)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a safe, autogenerated schema for Kubernetes authorization objects with no malicious intent or security risks. The detailed comments and references to CVEs demonstrate security awareness, not malicious activity.",
