  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, autogenerated schema for Kubernetes authorization objects, with explicit security considerations documented but no active vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The assigned low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal risk score reflects the code's static, declarative nature."
