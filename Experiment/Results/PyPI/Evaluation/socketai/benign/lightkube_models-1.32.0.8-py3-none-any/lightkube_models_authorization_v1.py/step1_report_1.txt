{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for Kubernetes authorization review API objects, including access reviews and attribute specifications.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules such as ._schema, meta_v1, and possibly external data when instances are created or serialized, but no explicit data input handling is shown.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or sent over networks, nor any code executing or writing external data directly.",
  "flows": "The data structures are intended to carry information internally within a system, with no explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks shown in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains detailed docstrings emphasizing security considerations, particularly around rawSelector and requirements fields to avoid CVE-2022-2880. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data class definitions modeling Kubernetes authorization API objects. It includes fields with optional parameters, and comprehensive documentation about security implications, notably on handling selectors to prevent parameter smuggling attacks. There are no functions, input handling, or network operations that could introduce malicious behavior. The structure appears standard and safe, focused on data modeling without suspicious or malicious code. The import statements and use of type hints are conventional. Overall, the code appears to serve as a safe, structured schema for authorization objects, with security considerations explicitly documented.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of safe data class definitions for Kubernetes authorization review objects, with no indications of malicious intent or harmful behavior. It is well-documented regarding security considerations to prevent parameter smuggling. No malicious code, backdoors, or insecure practices are present.",
