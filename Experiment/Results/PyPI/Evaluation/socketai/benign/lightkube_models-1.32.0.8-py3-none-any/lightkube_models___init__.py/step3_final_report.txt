  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to the __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it is a direct string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a simple assignment with no data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard version declaration in Python. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as benign, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. There are no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The code's simplicity and common usage justify these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
