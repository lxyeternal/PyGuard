  "flows": "No data flows observed",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a version string; no other code or logic present; no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns a string value to the variable __version__, which is a common practice for specifying package version. There are no functions, data inputs, external calls, or other logic. This minimal code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It does not contain hidden or suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a standard version declaration with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears benign and typical for Python packages.",
