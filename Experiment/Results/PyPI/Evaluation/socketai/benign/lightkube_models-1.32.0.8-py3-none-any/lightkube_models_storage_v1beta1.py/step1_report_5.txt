{
  "purpose": "Define data classes for volume attributes and their list, used in a Kubernetes CSI driver context.",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input; uses class definitions and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is sent or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; only class definitions and type annotations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Usage of type annotations and data classes appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward data class definitions with type annotations, used to model volume attributes in a Kubernetes environment. It imports necessary modules, defines classes with descriptive docstrings, and does not perform any dynamic execution, data processing, or external communication. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors. No obfuscated code or hidden logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard data modeling for a Kubernetes-related project, with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It serves as part of a larger system, providing structured data representations without executing harmful operations.",
