  "purpose": "Define data classes for volume attribute specifications used in CSI driver provisioning within a Kubernetes context.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class definitions, and import statements.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or points where untrusted data flows into security-critical operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class instantiation and field assignments without external input manipulation or unsafe handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. The code appears to be a standard data model definition with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data class definitions with type annotations and imports. It is primarily static, structured, and follows common conventions for defining API schemas. No external data sources, untrusted input handling, or dangerous functions are present. The code includes detailed docstrings and proper use of Python type hints. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The import statements are standard, and there is no suspicious logic or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard implementation of data models for Kubernetes volume attributes. It shows no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
