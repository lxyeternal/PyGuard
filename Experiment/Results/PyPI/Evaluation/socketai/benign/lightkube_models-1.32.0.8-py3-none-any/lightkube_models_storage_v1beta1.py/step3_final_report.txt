  "purpose": "Defines data classes representing volume attributes and their collection for Kubernetes CSI driver configuration.",
  "sources": "Type annotations, class definitions, and imported modules; no external input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static data schema definitions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward data modeling with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static Python dataclasses modeling volume attributes for Kubernetes, with no external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. It uses standard libraries and local modules for schema definitions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code's purpose is purely structural, serving as data schemas. The absence of external inputs, dynamic behaviors, or security-sensitive operations indicates a benign nature. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, assigning malware, obfuscated, and risk scores as zero, with high confidence. The code's static, well-documented structure aligns with typical schema definitions, and no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static data schema for Kubernetes volume attributes, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No adjustments are necessary.",
