{
  "purpose": "This code defines data structures (dataclasses) representing volume attributes for a Kubernetes CSI driver, including list collections.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; the code primarily defines classes and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output, storage, or external communication code is implemented.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows involving untrusted input to vulnerable sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, well-structured, with descriptive comments. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions using dataclasses, type annotations, and documentation strings. It imports typing utilities and references other modules for metadata types. There are no input handling, network operations, or data processing that could lead to vulnerabilities. The code appears to be auto-generated, but contains no suspicious or malicious constructs. It adheres to standard practices for defining data schemas.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, harmless data schema definition with no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is safe to use as part of a larger system, with no immediate security concerns.",
