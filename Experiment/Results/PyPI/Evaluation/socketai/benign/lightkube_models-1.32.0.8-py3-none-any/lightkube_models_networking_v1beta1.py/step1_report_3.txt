{
  "purpose": "This code defines data models for IP addresses, CIDRs, and related metadata, likely used in a network management or Kubernetes-related API context.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external or untrusted input; it only imports types and defines classes. No data input or external sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks for untrusted data or actions; the code does not perform data output, network communication, or system commands.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only declares data structures without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated and consists solely of data class definitions with no executable logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a set of data class definitions intended for modeling IP addresses, CIDRs, and associated metadata. It imports type hints and references to other modules for schema definitions. There are no functions, network operations, or code execution routines. The code does not handle user input, perform parsing, or interact with external systems. Its structure is straightforward, and it appears to be a standard schema definition likely generated automatically for API purposes. No signs of obfuscated or malicious code, such as dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a non-malicious, auto-generated schema definition module with no suspicious behavior. It serves as a data model layer for network-related objects without any security risks identified.",
