{
  "purpose": "The code defines data models for IP addresses, CIDRs, and related metadata, primarily used for network configuration in a Kubernetes-like environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from class initializations and imported modules such as meta_v1 and typing annotations.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not perform data output, network communication, or execute untrusted input. It mainly defines data structures.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is declarative and does not process external input dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be straightforward data model definitions with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All imports and constructs are standard for data class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The module consists of data class definitions representing network-related objects with type annotations and metadata. No functions perform data processing, input/output, or external communication. The code adheres to standard Python practices for defining data schemas and does not contain any hidden code or potentially malicious logic. There are no hardcoded secrets, code injection points, or unsafe operations observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a schema definition for network configuration objects and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, static data modeling module with no suspicious elements.",
