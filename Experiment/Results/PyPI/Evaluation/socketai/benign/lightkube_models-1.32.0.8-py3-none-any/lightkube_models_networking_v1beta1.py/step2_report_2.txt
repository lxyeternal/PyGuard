  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is straightforward data model definitions for IP addresses and related metadata. No dynamic code, no external input handling, no network operations, and no obfuscation.  \n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The report correctly identifies that the code is purely declarative and safe.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.5 (or lower). The report's assigned risk is 0, which seems appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, the code is just class definitions with no runtime logic or external interactions.  \n- **Assessment:** Correctly notes the absence of malicious or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The report assigns 0 risk, which is justified.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above—declarative data models, no executable logic, no external data processing.  \n- **Assessment:** Accurate.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The report's scores are reasonable.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar data class definitions with some comments and type hints. Slightly lower confidence (0.95) and a small security risk score (0.1), perhaps due to cautiousness about potential misuse or future extensions.  \n- **Assessment:** Still consistent. No actual malicious behavior or obfuscation.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 is reasonable given the cautious note, but overall, the code remains benign.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as previous—standard data models, no dynamic or malicious code.  \n- **Assessment:** Correct.  \n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1. The low risk score is appropriate.  \n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Presence:** The code consists solely of static data class definitions with no executable logic, input handling, or network operations.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware or obfuscation are evident in any report.  \n- **Risk Scores:** All are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Confidence:** High across all reports, as the analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0.1 (to account for cautiousness but recognizing the code's benign nature)\n\nThis module appears to be a standard, auto-generated schema definition with no malicious intent or security risks.",
