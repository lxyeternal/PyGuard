{
  "purpose": "Schema definitions for IP addresses, CIDRs, and related metadata used in network configuration and API representations.",
  "sources": "Class initializations, imported modules, and static class attributes; no external input or runtime data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative schema definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data class definitions with type annotations and descriptive docstrings. It imports standard modules and references other schema objects, but contains no executable logic, external data handling, or network operations. The code is static and auto-generated, serving as API data models. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The minimal security risk scores assigned in the reports (around 0.1) are conservative; given the static nature, the risk is effectively negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely schema definitions with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
