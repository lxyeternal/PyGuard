  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines data models for IP addresses and related metadata. It reads data from class initializations and imported modules, with no dynamic or external input processing.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The code is static, schema-like, and adheres to standard practices.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. The high confidence (1) is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, the code defines data structures for IP and CIDR representations, with no runtime logic or external data handling.\n- **Findings:** No anomalies, no suspicious patterns, no malicious intent. It’s a straightforward schema definition.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. Confidence 1 is appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, data classes for network configuration objects, with no dynamic code or external input processing.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is purely declarative.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0. Confidence 1 is justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Defines data models for IP and CIDRs, with no runtime or external data interactions.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. Slightly lower confidence (0.95) possibly due to the mention of \"securityRisk\": 0.1, but this is likely a conservative estimate for schema code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 (consistent with the report). The risk score reflects minimal concern for schema definitions.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar data models with no external data handling or dynamic code.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The \"securityRisk\" is again minimal (0.1), consistent with the nature of the code.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct. The code is static data class definitions with no malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate. The code is clear, auto-generated schema definitions, not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** The risk scores are very low (0 or 0.1). Given that this code is purely schema definitions with no runtime logic, this is appropriate. The slight elevation to 0.1 in some reports accounts for minimal security concern, perhaps due to the code being auto-generated or used in sensitive environments, but it does not indicate actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or execute untrusted input.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or vulnerabilities.\n- The structure and purpose are clear and standard for API schema definitions.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.05 (a very conservative, minimal risk score reflecting the schema's potential use in security-sensitive contexts, but no actual risk present)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, schema definitions with no security issues.",
