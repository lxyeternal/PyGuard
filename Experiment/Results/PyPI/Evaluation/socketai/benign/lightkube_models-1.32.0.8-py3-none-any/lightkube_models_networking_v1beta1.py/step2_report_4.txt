  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code consists solely of data class definitions, type annotations, and docstrings.\n- No functions, input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code appears to be auto-generated schema definitions for IP addresses, CIDRs, and related metadata.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- The import statements and class structures follow standard practices for API data modeling.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** No issues, standard data models, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning aligns with the code's static, schema-only nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, straightforward data classes, no dynamic or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No external input or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Data classes for IP and CIDR objects, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Clear, auto-generated schema code with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to above, standard data models, minimal security risk (0.1), no malware.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — justified given the minimal residual risk.\n- **Justification:** Slightly elevated security risk score (0.1) possibly due to the nature of the code being schema definitions, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, data models, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** Same reasoning as above.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly 0, with a slight increase to 0.1 in reports 4 and 5, which is reasonable given the schema nature of the code.\n\n**Are any scores unreasonable?**  \nNo. The scores are consistent with the code's static, schema-only purpose.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential adjustments or concerns:**\n\n- The only minor point is the small risk score (0.1) in some reports, which could be justified as a conservative measure since schema definitions could, in theory, be exploited if combined with malicious runtime code elsewhere. But in this isolated context, it's acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Final estimation:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — clear, standard code.\n- **Risk:** 0 — the code is purely declarative, with negligible security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a standard, auto-generated schema definition module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor risk scores are justified given the context but could be lowered to 0 if desired.\n\n**My final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware=0, obfuscated=0.  \n- Risk score can remain at 0 or be adjusted to 0 if a more conservative stance is preferred.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code poses no security threat and is a benign schema definition.",
