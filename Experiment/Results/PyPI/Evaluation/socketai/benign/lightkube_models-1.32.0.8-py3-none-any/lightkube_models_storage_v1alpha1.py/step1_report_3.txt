  "purpose": "Define data structures representing volume attributes and a list of such attributes for a Kubernetes CSI driver.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (_schema and meta_v1) and defines data classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data flows or external calls are detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified; the code is primarily data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code appears to be standard data class definitions with type annotations and docstrings.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Python dataclasses representing volume attributes, using type hints, optional fields, and imported metadata classes. There is no dynamic code execution, input handling, or network operations. The comments and structure are typical for autogenerated API models. The import of _schema and meta_v1 modules suggests dependency on external, likely benign, modules for metadata handling. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of data class definitions for Kubernetes volume attributes, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be standard autogenerated API model code.",
