{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for volume attributes and their collections in a Kubernetes-related context, with no explicit operational behavior.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads input or external data directly; it defines classes and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths involving untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only defines data models.",
  "anomalies": "The code is autogenerated, contains type hints, and includes detailed docstrings. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present. Usage of TYPE_CHECKING is typical for static analysis support.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes for volume attributes without executing any runtime logic or external data processing. It uses standard Python type hints, optional fields, and metadata imports, which are common in schema definitions. No network activity, file I/O, or dynamic execution is present. The code appears to be a standard schema/model definition for Kubernetes volume attributes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard, autogenerated schema definition for Kubernetes volume attributes and lists, with no malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security issues detected. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code. Overall security risk is minimal.",
