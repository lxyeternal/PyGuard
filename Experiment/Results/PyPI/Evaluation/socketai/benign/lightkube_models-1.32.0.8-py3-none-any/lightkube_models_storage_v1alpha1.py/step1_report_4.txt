{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures for volume attributes and their list, used in Kubernetes CSI driver interactions.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, local modules (_schema, meta_v1), and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform insecure operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical operations; primarily data class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns identified. The code is standard for data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python data classes and type hints to define schema-like structures for volume attributes. It includes type checking and imports related to Kubernetes object metadata. There are no indications of dynamic execution, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The code appears to be autogenerated schema definitions intended for API data handling, with no malicious or maliciously designed code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, autogenerated schema definition for volume attribute representations in a Kubernetes context. It contains no malicious, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The risk assessment is very low.",
