{
  "purpose": "The code defines data classes modeling Kubernetes Job and CronJob resources, including specifications, statuses, and policies, serving as schema representations for Kubernetes API objects.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and class attributes referencing imported modules (core_v1, meta_v1), with no external input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows, network calls, command executions, or I/O operations; purely declarative data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "The code contains no runtime data flows or untrusted data processing; it is static schema code.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or hidden code; marked as autogenerated, standard schema code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Python data classes representing Kubernetes resources, with no executable logic, external interactions, or security-sensitive operations. The absence of dynamic code, secrets, or obfuscation indicates a benign, schema-only module. Multiple reports confirm this understanding, assigning malware and obfuscation scores of 0 and very low security risk scores (~0.1), which are appropriate given the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, autogenerated schema module for Kubernetes resource definitions, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. It is safe for use in Kubernetes client or operator implementations.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
