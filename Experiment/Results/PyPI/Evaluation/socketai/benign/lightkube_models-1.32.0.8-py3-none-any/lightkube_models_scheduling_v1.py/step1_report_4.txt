{
  "purpose": "Define data structures for PriorityClass and PriorityClassList using dataclasses and type annotations, modeling Kubernetes API objects.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, local module references, and the dataclass decorator; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or data processing; no execution of external commands or data handling from untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code primarily declares data structures without processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. Use of type hints and dataclasses appears standard. No hardcoded secrets, no backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data classes, PriorityClass and PriorityClassList, which represent Kubernetes API objects. It uses standard Python typing, dataclasses, and references to other modules for metadata. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no network calls, or cryptographic operations. The code serves as a schema definition with no indications of malicious intent. It includes a comment about a fix for IDE autocompletion but nothing that raises security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe schema definition for Kubernetes priority classes. There are no malicious behaviors, no obfuscated code, and no security risks detected. It appears purely as a data model with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
