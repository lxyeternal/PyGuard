{
  "purpose": "Defines Kubernetes PriorityClass and PriorityClassList data schemas using Python dataclasses for API modeling.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions and type annotations; no external data sources or input handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code is declarative and does not process external input.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data class definitions with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of dataclasses, conditional imports for IDE support, and optional fields.",
  "analysis": "The code models Kubernetes priority classes with standard Python dataclasses, using type hints and optional metadata. It contains no dynamic code, network operations, or security-sensitive logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is purely structural, serving as schema definitions. The use of string annotations for 'Optional[...]' is acceptable, possibly due to code generation practices, but does not impact security. The overall structure is clean, correct, and aligns with best practices for schema modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of Kubernetes API data classes with no malicious or security risks. All signals indicate a safe, non-malicious schema definition. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the analysis.",
