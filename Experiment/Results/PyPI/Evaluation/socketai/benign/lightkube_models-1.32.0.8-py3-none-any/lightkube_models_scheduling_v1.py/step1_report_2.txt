  "purpose": "Define data structures for Kubernetes PriorityClass and PriorityClassList objects, including metadata.",
  "sources": "Type hints, import statements, and class definitions; no external or untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data is used to influence system behavior or leak data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes to potential external serialization or API interactions, but no such flows are explicitly present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code is standard data class definitions with no dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard data class definitions for Kubernetes API objects, including metadata and list structures. It uses type annotations, conditional imports for IDE support, and proper encapsulation. No external data sources, no network operations, and no suspicious patterns or obfuscation are present. The code appears purely structural, intended for defining data models, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a straightforward, benign definition of Kubernetes priority class data structures. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not perform any external operations or contain suspicious patterns.",
