{
  "purpose": "Defines data classes for Kubernetes PriorityClass and PriorityClassList objects, used for managing priority settings in a cluster.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, local modules (_schema, meta_v1), and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sources or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code is solely declarative class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code structures. The code is straightforward and consists of data models.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of Python data classes with type annotations, used for representing Kubernetes objects. It uses conditional import for type hints, standard dataclass syntax, and references to external metadata classes. There are no dynamic code execution, input handling, or network operations. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard, boilerplate data modeling implementation for Kubernetes resource definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of data classes for Kubernetes priority classes. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are identified. The code structure is clear, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
