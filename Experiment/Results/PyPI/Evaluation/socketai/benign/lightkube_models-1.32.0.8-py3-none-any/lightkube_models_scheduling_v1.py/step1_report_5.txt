{
  "purpose": "Define data classes for PriorityClass and PriorityClassList used in a Kubernetes-like API schema.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, internal module ._schema, and conditional import of dataclasses for type checking.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data processing; no network, file, or environment variable access present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code contains standard data class definitions with no suspicious code or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two data classes, PriorityClass and PriorityClassList, using standard Python typing and dataclass syntax. It includes type annotations, optional fields, and references to other modules for metadata. The conditional import for type checking is standard practice. No input/output handling, network activity, or environment variable usage is present. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code appears to be part of a schema or API model, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, schema-definition module for priority classes, with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is well-structured and uses standard practices. No threats are detected.",
