{
  "purpose": "This code defines data models for Kubernetes autoscaler resources using Python dataclasses, primarily for serialization/deserialization and type hinting.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and imported modules (typing, ._schema, meta_v1). No input or external data sources are explicitly read in this code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or sent over the network. No code writes or transmits data.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the code only declares data structures without dynamic data handling or execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated, with placeholder comments. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscation detected. No dynamic execution or suspicious logic found.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of Kubernetes resource data models using Python dataclasses. It relies on type annotations and imports from external modules, with no evidence of runtime behavior, data handling, or network operations. The use of TYPE_CHECKING is standard for type hints without runtime overhead. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The overall structure is clean and consistent with open-source schema definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated set of data models for Kubernetes autoscaler resources, with no malicious or security-related issues detected. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modification, making it safe from supply chain or malicious behavior perspectives.",
