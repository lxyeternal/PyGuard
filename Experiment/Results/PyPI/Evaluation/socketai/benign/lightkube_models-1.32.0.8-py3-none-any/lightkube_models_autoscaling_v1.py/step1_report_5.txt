{
  "purpose": "This module defines data classes representing Kubernetes autoscaling resources and their associated metadata for serialization and deserialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations and imported modules, notably the typing module and local modules such as ._schema and .",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks or data outputs that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; the code mainly defines data structures.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input are present; the code is purely structural and does not process runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. It is auto-generated and follows standard data class patterns with type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple @dataclass classes for Kubernetes autoscaler resources with type annotations and docstrings. It imports typing and local modules, employing type hints for optional fields. No user input handling, command execution, network communication, or data manipulation occurs. The code is purely declarative, establishing data structures for Kubernetes API objects. There are no suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward auto-generated data model for Kubernetes autoscaling resources. It does not include any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It is structurally sound and safe for use in managing Kubernetes resources.",
