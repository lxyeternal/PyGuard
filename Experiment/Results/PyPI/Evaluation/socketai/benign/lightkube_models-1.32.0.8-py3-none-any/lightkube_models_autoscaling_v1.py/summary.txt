  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of autogenerated data class definitions modeling Kubernetes autoscaler resources. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or runtime logic that could be exploited. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, schema-like nature. No security concerns or malicious activity are present, and the code is safe for use within trusted environments."
