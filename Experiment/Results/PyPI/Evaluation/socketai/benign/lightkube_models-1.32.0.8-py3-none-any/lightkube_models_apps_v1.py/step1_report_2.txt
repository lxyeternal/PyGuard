{
  "purpose": "This code defines data models for various Kubernetes resources using Python dataclasses, intended for use in managing and representing cluster states.",
  "sources": "The code reads class and attribute definitions, imports modules, and type annotations. It does not read external input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain data sinks or operations that process untrusted input to produce output or effects.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted data; the code is purely structural and declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code uses standard Python features and typing annotations for model definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code provides data model definitions for Kubernetes resource representations, using @dataclass and type annotations. It imports modules for metadata and runtime objects, and it uses optional fields for flexible resource descriptions. There are no external input operations, command execution, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code is purely declarative, defining data structures, with no embedded logic or operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data model definitions for Kubernetes resources, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be autogenerated or boilerplate code for API schema representations, with standard structure and no suspicious patterns.",
