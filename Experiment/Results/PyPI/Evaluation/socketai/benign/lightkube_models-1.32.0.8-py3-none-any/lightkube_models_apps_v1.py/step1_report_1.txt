{
  "purpose": "This module defines data classes representing Kubernetes API objects and their associated parameters, primarily for managing and monitoring containerized workloads.",
  "sources": "The code primarily reads static class definitions, type annotations, and optional metadata. No external data inputs or user inputs are read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could be written or cause side effects, as the code only declares data structures without any execution logic or I/O operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only contains class definitions with no runtime execution or data processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a comment about a fix for PyCharm autocompletion, but this is unrelated to malicious intent. All class definitions and type annotations appear standard and consistent with Kubernetes API schemas. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of Python dataclasses modeling Kubernetes resources, including Controllers, DaemonSets, Deployments, ReplicaSets, StatefulSets, and related status and strategy classes. The code uses standard Python typing, optional fields, and metadata annotations, with no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. The import statements are limited to typing and local modules related to Kubernetes schemas. No external data is processed or transmitted. The overall structure is straightforward, intended for serialization/deserialization of Kubernetes resource definitions, with no runtime behavior or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely declarative, defining data models for Kubernetes objects without executing any logic or I/O operations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks in the provided module.",
