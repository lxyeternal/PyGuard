  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python package or script that performs certain data processing or utility functions. The code does not demonstrate obvious malicious intent based on the provided fragment.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments, environment variables, or imported modules. Specific data sources are not explicitly visible in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls, but none are clearly present or triggered with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs or external sources to processing functions, with no evident untrusted data reaching sensitive sinks or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic code execution are apparent. The code appears straightforward and clean.",
  "analysis": "The code is examined for typical security issues such as input handling, data leakage, insecure code execution, or suspicious patterns. No such issues are identified. Usage of third-party libraries, environment variables, or network functions appears standard. No malicious backdoors or malicious data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The structure and content do not show signs of obfuscation or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to be a standard, benign Python script or module with no suspicious patterns.",
