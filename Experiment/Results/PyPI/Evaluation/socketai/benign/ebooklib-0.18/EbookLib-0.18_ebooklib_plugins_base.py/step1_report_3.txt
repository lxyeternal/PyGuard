  "purpose": "Defines a base plugin class for processing books and their items during read/write operations in EbookLib.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; class methods are placeholders invoked during book processing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output generation present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; methods return static True values without processing untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscated constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a base class with methods intended for hooks during ebook processing, all of which return True and do not perform any operations on data. It appears to be a standard, intentionally minimal plugin interface with no data manipulation, external calls, or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a harmless base plugin class for EbookLib with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a skeleton for extension, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
