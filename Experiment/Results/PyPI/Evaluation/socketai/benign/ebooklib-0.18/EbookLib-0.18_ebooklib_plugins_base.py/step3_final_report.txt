  "purpose": "This code defines a base class for plugin hooks in an eBook processing library, providing placeholder methods for processing before and after reading/writing books and HTML content.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines class methods.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; methods are placeholders returning True with no data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and well-documented.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign, standard plugin interface with no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network operations. All methods are placeholders returning True, serving as hooks for extension. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The license header is standard for open-source projects. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, well-structured plugin base class with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-sensitive content. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0, and confidence is high. No further action is necessary.",
