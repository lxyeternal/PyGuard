  "purpose": "Utility functions for EPUB/HTML/XML parsing, header extraction, and EPUB-specific element creation.",
  "sources": "Parsing functions (parse_string, parse_html_string), get_headers, get_pages, get_pages_for_items, create_pagebreak, guess_type, debug",
  "sinks": "None identified; functions process untrusted input but do not perform unsafe operations or data leaks",
  "flows": "Input strings flow into parsing functions; parsed content used for header/page extraction and element creation",
  "anomalies": "No malicious or suspicious code; exception handling in parse_string broad but not malicious; import of pprint inside debug is unusual but benign",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries with safe parameters, processes untrusted input in a typical manner, and performs content extraction and element creation. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. Exception handling may mask errors but does not facilitate malicious activity. No network activity or data exfiltration is evident. The functions are straightforward and serve content processing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign EPUB/HTML/XML utility module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are justified given the context. No adjustments are necessary.",
