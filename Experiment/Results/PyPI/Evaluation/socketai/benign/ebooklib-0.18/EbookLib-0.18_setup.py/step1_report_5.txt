{
  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for the EbookLib Python package, including reading the README file and converting links.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file via the read() function.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data is written or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' through the read() function, then passing content to setup() as long_description.",
  "anomalies": "The read() function performs regex substitution to convert Markdown links to reStructuredText links; this is a standard text processing operation with no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a read() function that reads a file and modifies Markdown links, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, no use of environment variables, network operations, or untrusted inputs beyond reading static files. The regex substitution is harmless and intended for formatting. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs standard operations for package configuration and documentation processing.",
