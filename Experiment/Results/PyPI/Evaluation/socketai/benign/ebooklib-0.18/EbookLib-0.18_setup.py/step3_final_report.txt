  "purpose": "The code defines package metadata and reads 'README.md' to convert Markdown links to reStructuredText format for documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file from local filesystem",
  "sinks": "Processes the content with regex substitution; no external data output or network activity",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> applies regex substitution -> passes processed string to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string processing and package setup",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup operation, reading a local Markdown file and converting links for documentation formatting. The regex operation is benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or external data handling. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. The code is clear, well-structured, and typical for Python package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All signals indicate safe operation.",
