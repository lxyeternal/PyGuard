{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the EbookLib Python package, handling package metadata, dependencies, and description processing.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file to generate long_description content.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external data handling beyond reading local files.",
  "flows": "Reads local 'README.md' file and processes it via regex substitution; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Uses regex to convert Markdown links to reStructuredText format; this is a benign string processing operation. No unusual or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration. It reads a local markdown file, transforms link syntax, and sets package metadata and dependencies. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is straightforward, using common libraries ('io', 're', 'setuptools') with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs standard package configuration tasks safely.",
