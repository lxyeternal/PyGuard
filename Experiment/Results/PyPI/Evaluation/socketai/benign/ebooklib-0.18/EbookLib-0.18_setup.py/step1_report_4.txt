{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for the 'EbookLib' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file via the read() function.",
  "sinks": "None directly, but the long_description content is derived from external input ('README.md').",
  "flows": "Reading the file content and inserting it into the setup configuration, with no external data being executed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "The read() function converts Markdown links to reStructuredText, which is standard documentation processing; no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a read() function to process 'README.md' content, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. The read() function performs regex substitution on Markdown links, which is benign. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. No anomalies or malicious intent are evident. Overall, this appears to be a typical package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
