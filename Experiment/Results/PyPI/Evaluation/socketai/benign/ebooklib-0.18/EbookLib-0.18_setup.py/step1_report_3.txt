  "purpose": "Define and configure the setup parameters for the Python package 'EbookLib' including reading and processing the README.md file.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file via the read() function, which opens and reads file content.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written to external systems or executed.",
  "flows": "Read file content → process with regex substitution → assign to long_description parameter in setup()",
  "anomalies": "The read() function converts Markdown links to reStructuredText links, which is standard text processing with no suspicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, defines a function to read and process a file, and then uses setuptools.setup() to configure package parameters. The read() function only processes and returns text content, with no execution or external network activity. All dependencies and data flows are standard for Python packaging. No anomalies, malicious behaviors, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with safe file reading and string processing. No signs of malicious behavior or security threats are present.",
