  "purpose": "Static configuration for ebook item types and file extensions used in the EbookLib library.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, version info, item type constants, extension mappings",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "N/A - static data definitions only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and declarative",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions, version info, and extension mappings for different ebook item types. There are no functions, input handling, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. The code is well-commented, static, and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious patterns. All reports correctly identify it as benign configuration data, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected or implied.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration module with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's nature.",
