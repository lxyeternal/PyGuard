  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step, considering the code and the provided assessments.\n\n**1. Confirm if issues are present:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is static configuration: constants, version info, and extension mappings. There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or network calls. No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in reasoning:**  \nThe reports uniformly state that the code is benign and purely declarative. This is accurate given the code snippet. No errors or flawed reasoning are apparent.\n\n**3. Review scores assigned to each issue:**  \n- *Malware score:* all reports assign 0, which is appropriate.  \n- *Obfuscated score:* all assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.  \n- *Security risk score:* all assign 0, which is correct.  \n- *Confidence:* all reports have 1, indicating high confidence, justified given the code's simplicity.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \nNo issues are present that would warrant a higher risk score. The code is static configuration with no dynamic or suspicious elements.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**  \nSince no malicious activity or code behavior is observed, malware should remain at 0.\n\n**6. Challenging assumptions about vulnerabilities:**  \nAll reports correctly assume no vulnerabilities based on the code provided. There are no hidden or obfuscated parts that could conceal malicious intent.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report:**  \nScores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on the code and reports, I concur that the code is benign.**  \n**My estimated scores would be:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward static configuration module defining constants and mappings for an ebook library. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present. The high confidence and zero scores across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate; no changes needed. The code is safe and benign.",
