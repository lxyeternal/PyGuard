  "purpose": "Define constants, license information, and file extension mappings for an Ebook library module.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading or data input functions present)",
  "sinks": "None (no data output or untrusted data handling functions present)",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is only defining static data structures and constants",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed; only licensing comments, constants, and a dictionary",
  "analysis": "The code consists of licensing comments, version info, item type constants, and a dictionary mapping item types to file extensions. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, no network or system calls, and no dynamic code execution. The code appears to be standard for defining static configuration or constants for a library.\n\nThere are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The license comments are standard open-source license headers. The constants and extension mappings are straightforward and typical for an application handling various media types.\n\nOverall, this code segment is purely declarative with no potential security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module defining constants and mappings for an Ebook library. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are present.",
