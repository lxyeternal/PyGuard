  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static configuration, constants, and mappings.\n- No functions, input handling, network calls, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- All reports conclude the code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the description: static constants, version info, item type constants, and extension mappings.\n- No code flaws, errors, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- No obfuscation or malicious code detected.\n- The code is consistent with the reported conclusions.\n\n### Potential issues or inconsistencies:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no issues are found in the logical reasoning or conclusions.\n- The malware score of 0 is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Scoring justifications:\n- **Malware score:** 0 is correct; no malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is correct; code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk score:** 0 is appropriate; static configuration without vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is a benign, static configuration module.\n- No changes needed to the scores or conclusions.\n- The detailed reasoning in the reports is sound and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe configuration snippet with no security issues or malicious intent.",
