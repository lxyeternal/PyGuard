  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports agree that the code is purely static configuration: constants, license comments, and extension mappings. There are no functions, no input/output handling, no network calls, and no dynamic behavior. Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code appears benign and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and thorough in their analysis. They correctly identify that the code is static configuration data. No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning. They do not overlook any potential issues such as hidden malicious code, obfuscation, or data handling vulnerabilities, which are not present here.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature. The confidence scores are 1, indicating certainty in their assessments. These scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious or security concerns, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified. The code is purely static configuration, with no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**  \nAll reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. There is no indication of malicious behavior, backdoors, or hidden payloads.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nThe reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static, straightforward nature of the code. Their reasoning is sound.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nThe scores are consistent across reports and with the code's characteristics.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is clear, straightforward, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n**Overall, the code is a benign configuration module with no security issues.**",
