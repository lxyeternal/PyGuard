  "purpose": "Define constants and mappings for an ebook library package, including version info, item types, and file extension associations.",
  "sources": "Constants and dictionaries declared at the module level.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points that handle untrusted input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed. The code appears to be standard configuration and constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of constant declarations, a version tuple, and a dictionary mapping item types to file extensions. There are no functions, input handling, network calls, or data processing routines. All elements serve as static configuration data. The code adheres to standard practices for defining constants and mappings without any suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration module for an ebook library project. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of an open-source project.",
