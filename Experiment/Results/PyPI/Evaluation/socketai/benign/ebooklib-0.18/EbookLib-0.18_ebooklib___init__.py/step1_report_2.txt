  "sources": "Constants and data structures defining item types and extensions; no external input reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data are present; no data leaks or external communications are involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists in the code; it's purely static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward configuration and constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of metadata, constants, and mappings related to ebook item types and file extensions. There are no functions, external data inputs, or operations that could lead to security issues. The license comments and versioning information are standard. No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration module defining constants and extension mappings for an ebook processing library. No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are detected.",
