  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if the issues are present in the code**\n\nAll reports agree that the code is purely static configuration: constants, version info, and extension mappings. No functions, input handling, network calls, or data processing routines are present. This is consistent with the code snippet provided.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning**\n\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- They note the absence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or code anomalies.\n- The reasoning that the code is purely static configuration is sound and consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - confidence: 1\n\nThese scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any high risk scores**\n\n- Since all reports agree that there's no malicious behavior or security risk, high scores are unwarranted.\n- The code is straightforward, with no dynamic or untrusted data handling.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge any claims based on assumptions**\n\n- The reports assume the code is benign because it is static configuration. This is reasonable.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made or implied.\n\n**Step 6: Consistency of scores**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no discrepancies.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard static configuration module with no suspicious or malicious content. All analyses support that there are no security risks, malware, or obfuscation present.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n- The confidence level of 1 is justified, given the clarity and simplicity of the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores accurately reflect the content and risk profile of the code.",
