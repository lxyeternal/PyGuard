  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only initializes static data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily contains license comments, version info, item type constants, and a dictionary mapping item types to file extensions. There are no functions, user input handling, external data reads, or network interactions. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are apparent. The code appears to be a straightforward static configuration module for an ebook processing library.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign static configuration module with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
