  "flows": "Import of LocalConfig -> creation of config object via LocalConfig()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; minimal code, no hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named LocalConfig from a module called localconfig.manager, then creates an instance of LocalConfig. This appears to be standard configuration management code. No data is read directly from external sources within this snippet, and no untrusted data flows are visible. There are no suspicious functions, obfuscated code, or indicators of malicious behavior. The module name suggests local configuration, which is common and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward configuration setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
