  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issue presence:** The code snippet is benign; it only imports and instantiates a class. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.\n- **Errors/flaws:** The report correctly notes the lack of context about what `LocalConfig` does internally. No logical flaws identified.\n- **Scores:** Confidence is 0.6, malware 0, risk 0.2. These seem reasonable given the minimal code but acknowledge uncertainty about internal behavior.\n- **Justification:** Since no malicious activity is observed, the scores are appropriate. The slight security risk score (0.2) accounts for the unknown internal operations of `LocalConfig`.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; the code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correctly states that no suspicious patterns are present.\n- **Scores:** Confidence is 1, malware 0, risk 0. These are justified given the simplicity and benign appearance.\n- **Justification:** No reason to increase the risk or malware scores.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same conclusion; minimal code, no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correctly notes that internal behavior of `LocalConfig` is unknown.\n- **Scores:** Confidence at 0.5, malware 0, risk 0.1. Slightly lower confidence reflects uncertainty, but scores remain low.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score is appropriate, given the lack of suspicious activity.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as previous; code appears benign.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correct assessment.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.9, malware 0, risk 0.1. High confidence justified by the simplicity; low risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; no malicious indicators.\n- **Errors/flaws:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, risk 0.0. Appropriate for a simple configuration load.\n- **Justification:** No security issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly varied but generally low, reflecting minimal security concern given the limited code.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, based on internal behavior unknowns, but no evidence of issues)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are reasonable given the code snippet. Without further details about what `LocalConfig` does internally, there's no justification for higher risk or malware scores. The overall security posture based on this snippet appears benign.",
