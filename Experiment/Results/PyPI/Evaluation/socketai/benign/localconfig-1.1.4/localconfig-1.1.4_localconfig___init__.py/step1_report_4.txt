  "purpose": "To import and initialize a local configuration manager object.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'localconfig.manager' module.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of 'LocalConfig' object; potential data usage or configuration loading within the constructor.",
  "flows": "Importation → object instantiation; any data or configuration processing occurs during 'LocalConfig()' creation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or malicious functions evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class 'LocalConfig' from a local module and creates an instance. Without access to the 'LocalConfig' implementation, it's unclear what actions occur during instantiation. The code itself is minimal and appears benign. It doesn't perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code explicitly. The structure and content are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import and object instantiation, likely used for configuration management. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks based on this fragment alone.",
