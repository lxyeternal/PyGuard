  "purpose": "Load configuration settings using the LocalConfig class from the localconfig.manager module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing LocalConfig from localconfig.manager; instantiation of LocalConfig object assigned to variable 'config'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks observed; no data output, network communication, or storage actions in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import leads to creation of a LocalConfig object, but no further data flow is shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from an external module, then creates an instance of that class. No data manipulation, input handling, or malicious patterns are evident. The snippet does not contain any network activity, file writing, or other potential malicious behaviors. The only potential concern is the imported module; however, without additional context, it appears to be a standard configuration pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears to be a standard configuration loading pattern with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
