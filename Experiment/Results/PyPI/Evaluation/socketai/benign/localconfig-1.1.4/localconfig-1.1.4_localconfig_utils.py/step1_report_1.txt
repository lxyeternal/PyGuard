  "purpose": "Utility functions for type checking and configuration parsing in Python.",
  "sources": "None; the code only reads its own input parameters and constants.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used in a way that causes effects or leaks.",
  "flows": "N/A; the functions operate independently without external data flows or output channels.",
  "anomalies": "The regular expression for configuration key detection appears benign. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present. No dynamic code execution or network activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several type checking functions and a regex for identifying configuration key-value pairs. These functions operate on input values, typically provided as parameters, without reading external sources or performing I/O. The regex is straightforward, matching common configuration key patterns. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The functions are simple and do not invoke external commands, access environment variables, or contain obfuscated code. The overall structure is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for configuration parsing and type validation. It contains no malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided content.",
