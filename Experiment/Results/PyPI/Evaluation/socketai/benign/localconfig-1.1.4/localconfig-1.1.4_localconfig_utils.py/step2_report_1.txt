  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code consists of utility functions for type checking and a regex for configuration key detection.\n- No external data sources, network activity, or system modifications are involved.\n- The functions are straightforward, with proper exception handling and no suspicious patterns.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The regex pattern `r'[A-Za-z0-9\\-\\_\\.]+\\s*='` matches typical configuration key-value lines, which is standard.\n- The functions like `is_float`, `is_int`, `is_bool`, etc., perform simple type checks.\n- The `to_bool` function converts strings to boolean based on common true values.\n- The `is_config` function checks for presence of newline or pattern match, which is a typical heuristic.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation:**\n- No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present.\n- The code does not execute dynamic code, perform network operations, or access environment variables.\n- The regex and functions are simple and standard.\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- The overall security risk is 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Scores:**\n- The scores given (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are reasonable.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n- Based on the provided code and reports, I concur with the assessments.\n- The code is a benign utility module with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis.",
