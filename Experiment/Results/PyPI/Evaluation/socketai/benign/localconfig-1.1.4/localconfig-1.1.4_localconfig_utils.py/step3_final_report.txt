  "purpose": "Utility functions for type checking and configuration pattern detection in Python code.",
  "sources": "Function parameters passed to is_float, is_int, is_int_base_n, is_bool, is_none, to_bool, is_config; the regex pattern matching configuration lines.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs; functions operate on input parameters only.",
  "flows": "Input values are checked through type conversions or regex matching; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with standard regex and type checks, no obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises simple utility functions for type validation and a regex for configuration key detection. It does not perform any I/O, network activity, or dynamic code execution. Exception handling is appropriate. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The functions are safe, standard, and do not access environment variables or system resources. The regex pattern is typical for configuration parsing. All indicators point to benign utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for configuration parsing and data validation, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
