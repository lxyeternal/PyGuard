  "purpose": "Utility functions for type checking and parsing configuration-like strings in Python.",
  "sources": "None (no input reading from external sources; only functions processing input values).",
  "sinks": "None (no data output, network operations, or system commands).",
  "flows": "Input values are passed to functions which perform type checks or pattern matching; no flow to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The regex pattern for configuration keys allows various characters including hyphens, underscores, dots, and whitespace before '='; no suspicious or malicious patterns detected. Functions are simple and do not execute untrusted data or perform harmful actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions to check data types and patterns, such as floats, ints, booleans, and configuration key-value lines. The regex pattern appears to target configuration-style strings. Functions like 'to_bool' and 'is_config' operate on provided string values, with no execution of untrusted code or external interactions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The functions are straightforward and serve standard validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing basic type and pattern checks without any malicious intent or security risks. It functions as utility validation code with no suspicious behavior.",
