  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as utility functions for type checking and configuration parsing.\n- They emphasize the absence of external data sources, network activity, or code execution.\n- The regex pattern appears benign, matching common configuration key-value formats.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are noted.\n- The functions are straightforward, with safe exception handling and no malicious behavior.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code does not read external inputs directly (apart from function parameters), nor does it perform I/O, network, or system commands.\n- The regex is simple and designed for configuration key detection.\n- The functions perform basic type checks and conversions without side effects.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware score: 0 across all reports aligns with the analysis; no malicious activity is present.\n- Obfuscated score: 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Risk score: 0.5 or below is appropriate, given the benign nature; all reports give 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a safe utility module with no security risks or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and justified.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:**\nThe overall assessment is that this code is benign, standard utility functions with no security concerns. The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
