  "purpose": "Utility functions for type checking and configuration pattern matching in Python.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines functions and a regex pattern. No input reading or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code only contains function definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The regex is straightforward, and functions perform standard type checks.",
  "analysis": "The code defines regex pattern for configuration key matching and several functions to identify data types and convert values, including boolean, float, int, and None. The functions use standard Python practices. No input handling, network communication, or data leaks are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for type validation and configuration pattern matching. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
