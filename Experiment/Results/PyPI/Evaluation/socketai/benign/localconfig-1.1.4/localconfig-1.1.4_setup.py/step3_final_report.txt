  "purpose": "The code is a standard setup.py script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.rst file for long_description; static metadata fields; no untrusted input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static metadata assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Author email contains a typo ('maxzheng.os @t gmail.com') with an extra space, but this is a formatting issue, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup.py with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input. The only irregularity is the malformed email address, which is likely a typo. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's behavior aligns with standard packaging practices, and the minor email typo does not impact security. The malware score is correctly 0, as there is no malicious intent. The risk score is also 0 or 0.1, reflecting the minor typo, but overall, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script is benign, with no signs of malware or security risks. The only issue is a minor typo in the author email, which does not constitute a security concern. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0 are appropriate.",
