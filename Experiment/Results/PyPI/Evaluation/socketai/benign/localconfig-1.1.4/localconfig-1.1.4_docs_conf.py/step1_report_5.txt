  "purpose": "Configuration setup for Sphinx documentation generation for the 'localconfig' project.",
  "sources": "Imports of sys and os modules; configuration variables and lists; no external data input handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static configuration code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious dynamic code; no obfuscation, network calls, or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with typical setup parameters, extensions, and output options. It imports standard Python modules but does not execute any external commands or handle untrusted input. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is purely declarative and for documentation purposes. All variables are static, and there are no indications of malicious payloads or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard configuration script for documentation generation with no malicious intent, malware, or security risks detected.",
