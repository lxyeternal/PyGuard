  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file, setting project info, extensions, output options, and paths. No dynamic execution, network calls, or data handling occurs that could indicate malicious behavior. The import of sys and os modules is typical for configuration scripts, and no suspicious code patterns or obfuscated constructs are present. The file strictly contains static configuration data with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration file for Sphinx documentation generation with no indicators of malicious or maliciously sabotaged behavior.",
