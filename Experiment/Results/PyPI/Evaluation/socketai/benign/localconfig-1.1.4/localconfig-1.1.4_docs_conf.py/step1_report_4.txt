  "purpose": "Configuration file for building documentation using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "Import statements ('import sys', 'import os').",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data sinks or external data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to standard import usage; no untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Sphinx configuration file setting parameters for documentation generation. It imports only standard libraries ('sys' and 'os') with no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no external data handling. All settings relate to documentation aesthetics and structure. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or backdoors. The code appears to be straightforward configuration without hidden or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration script for documentation generation with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
