  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign implementation of a constraint operator with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only potential security concern is the execution of user-defined functions, which is inherent in such frameworks but does not indicate malicious activity. Therefore, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score low (~0.1-0.2)."
