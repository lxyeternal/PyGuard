  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and justified given the routine environment variable check. Overall, the code is safe for supply chain purposes."
