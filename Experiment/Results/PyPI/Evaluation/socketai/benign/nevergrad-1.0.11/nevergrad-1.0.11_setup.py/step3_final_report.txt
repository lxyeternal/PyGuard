  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'nevergrad', handling requirements, version extraction, link rewriting, and CI version verification.",
  "sources": "Reads requirements files, README.md, and the '__init__.py' for version; environment variable 'CIRCLE_TAG'; file existence checks for links.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variable for version verification; no data leaks or external network activity; no untrusted data sinks.",
  "flows": "Source: requirements files, README.md, version extraction; Sink: environment variable check, link URL construction; Flow: data read from files to setup configuration, environment variable to version validation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic; link rewriting is benign; environment variable check is routine in CI/CD pipelines.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks with straightforward logic. The version is extracted via regex, links are converted for display, and a custom command verifies CI version consistency. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The environment variable usage is standard practice, with minimal risk. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with benign package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, benign setup configuration with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are appropriate and justified given the routine environment variable check. Overall, the code is safe for supply chain purposes.",
