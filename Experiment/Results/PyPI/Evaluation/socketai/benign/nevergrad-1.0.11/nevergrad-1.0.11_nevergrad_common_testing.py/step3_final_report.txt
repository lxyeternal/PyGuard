  "purpose": "Utility functions for testing, link validation, warnings suppression, and system-based test skipping.",
  "sources": "Reads local markdown files for link validation; uses standard libraries, numpy, and a local errors module.",
  "sinks": "No external data exfiltration or network activity; link validation only checks local file existence.",
  "flows": "Reads markdown files, verifies links, suppresses warnings, and conditionally skips tests based on platform info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard testing utilities.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises testing utilities such as assertions, link validation, warnings suppression, and test decorators. It reads local files to validate links, manages warnings, and controls test execution based on system info. No network activity, external data leaks, or malicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and uses common testing practices. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk approximately 0.1) are justified given the filesystem and environment interactions, which are benign in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of testing utilities with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and the overall assessment aligns with the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
