  "purpose": "A test suite validating constraint behavior within an optimization framework, using randomly generated data and internal assertions.",
  "sources": "Data generated via numpy's np.random.randn() within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or sensitive data handling; internal assertions only.",
  "flows": "Input data from numpy functions flows through constraint application and validation functions, with no external sinks involved.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward pytest-based test suite for a constraint mechanism, utilizing numpy for data generation and the 'nevergrad' library for parameter handling. It performs internal assertions to verify expected behavior of constraints. No malicious code, obfuscation, or external data transmission is present. The code's purpose is to validate functionality, not to perform any harmful or covert actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is appropriately set to 0. The security risk is minimal; a score of 0 is justified given the absence of external interactions or sensitive data handling. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting the code's clarity.",
