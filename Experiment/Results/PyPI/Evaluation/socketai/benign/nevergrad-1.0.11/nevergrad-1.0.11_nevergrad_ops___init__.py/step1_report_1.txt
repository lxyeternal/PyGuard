{
  "purpose": "Module imports and exports related to parametrization, data layers, and constraints, likely for a larger system involving mutations and constraints management.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; no external input sources are present in this code fragment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or external communication points are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious code structures are present. The code appears standard for a Python module defining exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules from relative paths, indicating part of a larger package. It includes a copyright notice and license statement, and defines an __all__ list for public API exposure. No external data processing, no user input, no external communication, and no suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module setup with no malicious intent or security risks. It is likely part of a larger, legitimate project. No indicators of malware, malicious behavior, or security concerns are present.",
