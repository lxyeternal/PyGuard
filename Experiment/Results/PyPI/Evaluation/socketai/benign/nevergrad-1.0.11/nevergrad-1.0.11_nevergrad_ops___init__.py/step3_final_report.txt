{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports specific components from internal packages and defines an export list for use in a larger project, likely related to data parametrization or modeling.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: '..parametrization.mutation', '..parametrization._datalayers.Int', and '.constraints'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not handle external input or output.",
  "flows": "Import statements serve as sources; no data flows to sinks or external systems are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with standard import and export declarations, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports specific components from internal relative modules and defines an '__all__' list for exports. It includes licensing comments and does not perform any runtime logic, data processing, external communication, or contain any obfuscated or malicious code. The structure and content are typical for a modular package component. Given the absence of dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious patterns, there are no security concerns. The code's benign nature is consistent with the reports' conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. All reports correctly identify its safe and straightforward nature, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
