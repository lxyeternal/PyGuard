{
  "purpose": "The code defines module exports and imports specific components related to parametrization, constraints, and data layers, likely for use in a larger framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (`..parametrization`, `..parametrization._datalayers`, and `.`)",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs in this code",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; code only sets up imports and exports",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, involving only import statements and setting `__all__`. It appears to be part of a larger codebase, serving as a module initializer or interface. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The code is minimal and standard for Python modules that organize exports.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module setup with no malicious intent, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks. It appears safe and typical for Python projects.",
