{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module exports for a package related to parametrization, constraints, and data layers, likely used in a larger project for data manipulation or modeling.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and objects from relative paths within the package: '..parametrization', '..parametrization._datalayers', and '.'",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or potentially leaked, as the code only imports modules and defines the __all__ list",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and objects, establishing dependencies but does not process external input or data flows beyond module imports",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious operations. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical module setup conventions",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and functions from internal package paths, indicating modular design. It then defines __all__ to specify public exports. There is no user input handling, data processing, or network communication. The license comment suggests open-source intent. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It primarily manages namespace exports for a package. Overall, it appears benign.",
