{
  "purpose": "The code defines imports and exports for a module related to parametrization, mutations, constraints, and data layers, likely for a larger framework or library.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ..parametrization.mutation, ..parametrization._datalayers.Int, and .constraints",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or perform any data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward with standard import/export statements. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module setup, importing specific components from internal modules and defining __all__ for export. It contains no runtime logic, data handling, or external communication. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module setup code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard, safe Python module structure.",
