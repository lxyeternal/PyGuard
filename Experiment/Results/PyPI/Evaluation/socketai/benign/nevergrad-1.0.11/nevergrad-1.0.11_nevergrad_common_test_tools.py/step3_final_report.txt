  "purpose": "Test functions for utility modules including pairing, round-robin, grouping, sleeping, set operations, environment variable management, flattening, and hyperparameter randomization.",
  "sources": "Environment variables set and unset within controlled context managers; data read from function parameters and standard libraries.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network operations; environment variables are used only within testing scope.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through utility functions; environment variable setting affects only local test context.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for utility functions, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. Environment variables are manipulated safely within test contexts, and no external data or network activity is present. The code relies on standard libraries and internal modules, with clear, readable structure. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of utility function tests with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The environment variable manipulations are safe and typical for testing purposes. The overall security posture is very low, and the code can be considered safe for supply chain purposes.",
