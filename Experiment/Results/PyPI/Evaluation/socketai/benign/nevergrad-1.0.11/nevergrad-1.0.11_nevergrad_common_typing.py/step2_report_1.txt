  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as primarily consisting of type aliases, protocol interfaces, and import statements.\n- No dynamic code execution, data handling, or external system interactions are present.\n- The code is consistent across reports, emphasizing type safety and interface definitions.\n- No suspicious or malicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are identified.\n- The use of try-except for importing 'Protocol' from 'typing' or 'typing_extensions' is standard for compatibility.\n- The numpy import is solely for type annotations related to arrays, not for executing any code.\n\n**Specific Points:**\n- The code does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or write to files.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The purpose is to define types and protocols, which is a common and safe practice.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Malware:** 0 — No malicious behavior or intent is evident.\n- **Risk:** 0 — Since there's no malicious activity or security risk, the overall risk score should be zero.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment that this code is benign and purely for type hinting and interface setup.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary; they correctly reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, safe setup for type annotations and interface definitions, with no security concerns.",
