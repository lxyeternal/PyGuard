{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases, imports, and protocol interfaces for use in other code modules, primarily related to typing and executor abstractions.",
  "sources": "Imports various typing modules, pathlib.Path, numpy, and defines type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; code mainly sets up type definitions and protocols.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code observed. The code is straightforward and primarily type-related.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard Python libraries, including typing, pathlib, and numpy, and defines type aliases and protocols for job and executor interfaces. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious operations. The use of try-except for Protocol import ensures compatibility with different Python versions. No signs of malicious or sabotage behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup of type definitions and protocols without any malicious intent or security risks.",
