{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases, import standard libraries, and create protocol interfaces for executor and job-like objects.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, typing_extensions, pathlib, and numpy; definitions of type aliases and protocol classes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external network interaction; no apparent data leaks or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow involving untrusted input or insecure handling; code is purely type and protocol definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. The code is straightforward and purely for type hinting and interface definition.",
  "analysis": "The code provides type aliasing, imports, and protocol definitions for job execution patterns. It uses standard Python modules and common type annotations, with no evidence of dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent is detected. The inclusion of 'try-except' for Protocol import ensures compatibility across Python versions, which is a common practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of type definitions and imports for structuring asynchronous job execution interfaces. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
