  "purpose": "Define type aliases and protocol interfaces for asynchronous job execution and type annotations.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, pathlib, numpy, and typing_extensions; type alias definitions; protocol class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not process untrusted input or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; static type definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward type aliasing and interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type aliases, import statements, and protocol class definitions for job and executor interfaces. It imports standard libraries and numpy for type annotations, with a fallback import for 'Protocol'. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The code serves as a foundation for type safety in larger systems and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and safe. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
