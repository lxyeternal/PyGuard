  "purpose": "Define convenient type aliases and protocol interfaces for a Python project, including type annotations, and import necessary modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from standard libraries (typing, pathlib, numpy, typing_extensions) and local type alias definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data inputs or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; primarily type definitions and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; straightforward type and protocol definitions. Use of 'try-except' for importing 'Protocol' is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports various type annotations from the 'typing' module, defines type aliases for common data structures and data types, and sets up Protocol classes for asynchronous task execution. It includes a fallback import for 'Protocol' for environments where 'typing.Protocol' may not be available, which is standard practice. There are no functions, data input, or output mechanisms that could be exploited. The numpy import is used for type annotations related to arrays, not for executing malicious code. The overall structure is consistent with a type definition module, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of type aliases, protocol definitions, and imports used for type hinting and code structure purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity. The code is straightforward and safe.",
