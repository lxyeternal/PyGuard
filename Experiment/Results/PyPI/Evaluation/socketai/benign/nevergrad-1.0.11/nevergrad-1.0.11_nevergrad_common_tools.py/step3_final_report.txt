  "sources": "Reading environment variables, loading shared libraries from site-packages, iterating over data structures.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic loading of shared libraries via ctypes, environment variable modification.",
  "flows": "Loading shared libraries during 'pytorch_import_fix' potentially exposes to exploitation if malicious libraries are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad exception handling, print statements for import errors, dynamic library loading as a workaround.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of utility functions with no network activity or code injection. The 'pytorch_import_fix' function loads specific shared libraries dynamically, which could be exploited if malicious libraries are introduced into the environment. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious code and assign a malware score of 0. The risk score of 0.2 reflects the minor concern related to dynamic library loading, which is a known workaround rather than malicious intent. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation detected. The overall assessment aligns across reports, indicating low risk and no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily utility functions with a known workaround for PyTorch. The only minor concern is the dynamic shared library loading, which could be exploited if malicious libraries are present, but this is a common and documented technique. Scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.",
