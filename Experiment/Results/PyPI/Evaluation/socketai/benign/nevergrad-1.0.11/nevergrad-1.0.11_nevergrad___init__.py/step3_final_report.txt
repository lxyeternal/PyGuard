{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a package initializer (__init__.py) that imports internal modules, sets the public API via __all__, and defines the package version.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.common, .parametrization, .optimization, .ops, .errors) and the setting of __all__ and __version__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not handle external input, network communication, or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Imports modules and sets metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward. The comment about 'busy namespace' is benign and typical in large modular packages.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py file for a Python package, importing internal modules and defining public API exports. It does not perform any dynamic execution, handle sensitive data, or contain obfuscated or malicious code. The structure and content are typical for open-source packages, with no suspicious patterns or behaviors. The comments and import statements are benign, and the code's purpose is purely structural.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals and reports correctly identify it as a standard package initializer. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are appropriate at 0. The overall assessment confirms the code poses no security concerns.",
