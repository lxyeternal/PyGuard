{
  "purpose": "Performs a left similarity join between two CSV files based on n-gram similarity of specified columns.",
  "sources": "Reads input CSV files, command-line arguments, and user-specified file paths.",
  "sinks": "Writes output CSV file, potentially to user-specified location; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reads input files; processes data via n-gram similarity; writes results to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious obfuscation or unnecessary dynamic code execution; uses external 'ngram' library without suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a straightforward similarity join on CSV files, utilizing the 'ngram' library for processing. It validates file existence and input parameters, processes CSV data, and outputs results accordingly. No embedded network operations, data exfiltration, or system manipulations are observed. No suspicious code patterns, backdoors, or malicious payloads detected. The only external dependency is the 'ngram' library, which is a standard approach for string similarity tasks. The command-line interface and file handling are conventional, with proper input validation. Overall, the code appears benign and aligned with its intended purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CSV similarity join utility with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It performs its described function securely without embedding harmful code or behaviors.",
