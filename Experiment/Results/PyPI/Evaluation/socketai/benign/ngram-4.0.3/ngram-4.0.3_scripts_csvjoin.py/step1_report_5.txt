{
  "purpose": "Perform a similarity join between two CSV files based on n-gram similarity for matching rows.",
  "sources": "Reads input CSV files specified by file paths, reads command-line arguments, and loads data into memory via the NGram class.",
  "sinks": "Outputs results to a specified CSV file. Uses file operations for reading and writing, and possibly external libraries.",
  "flows": "Reads files -> processes data with NGram-based search -> writes matched or unmatched rows to output file.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious string operations. Uses external library 'ngram', but this is not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code or unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a CSV-based similarity join using an external 'ngram' library, with input validation and file operations. It reads CSV files, processes text data with normalization, and writes output accordingly. No signs of malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors are present. The use of standard libraries and file operations appears legitimate. The external 'ngram' module's source is unknown, but usage here does not indicate malicious intent. No code injection, data exfiltration, or system sabotage code is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a CSV similarity join tool utilizing an external n-gram library. It performs standard file reading/writing, input validation, and data processing without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No malware indications or security risks are evident from this code segment.",
