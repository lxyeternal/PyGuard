  "purpose": "Performing a similarity join between two CSV files based on n-gram string similarity.",
  "sources": "Reads input CSV files specified by the user, including file paths provided via command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to a specified CSV file; no untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input files through the n-gram similarity processing, then results are written to an output file. No untrusted data appears to be sent elsewhere or over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of standard libraries and a third-party n-gram library is benign. No signs of malicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a CSV similarity join based on n-gram matching. It reads input files, processes data using the NGram class, and writes results to an output file. Command-line argument parsing validates file existence and parameter ranges. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or code injections, is present. The code relies on external library 'ngram', which appears to be a standard implementation for string similarity. The script does not include any obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious instructions.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a CSV similarity join tool utilizing an external n-gram library. It performs input validation and file handling securely. No malicious behavior or malware indications are evident. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate data processing utility with no security risks.",
