{
  "purpose": "Performs a CSV similarity join based on n-gram string similarity, matching rows from two CSV files and outputting matched pairs with similarity scores.",
  "sources": "Reads input CSV files using open(), processes data with the 'ngram' library, and reads command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writes output CSV file with matched rows and similarity scores.",
  "flows": "Reads data from input files, processes with 'NGram' for similarity, outputs matched rows with scores.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open()' without context managers, which is a minor resource leak concern but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard CSV similarity join without network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code. External 'ngram' library usage appears benign. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The only minor issue is the lack of 'with' statements for file handling, which does not impact security. All reports correctly assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk scores (~0.1-0.2). The overall behavior is benign and intended for data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign CSV similarity join utility with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. No adjustments are necessary.",
