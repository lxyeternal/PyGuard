{
  "purpose": "The script performs a similarity join between two CSV files based on n-gram similarity of specified columns, outputting matched or unmatched rows with similarity scores.",
  "sources": "Reads input files specified by user (left and right CSV files), reads command-line arguments, reads data from CSV files, and imports the 'ngram' module.",
  "sinks": "Outputs results to a specified CSV file, with no evident untrusted data sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reads input files -> processes data with 'NGram' for similarity -> writes output CSV with matching rows and scores.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'open' without explicit context management (no 'with' statement), which could lead to resource leaks, but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated code detected; standard library functions used appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard CSV similarity join, utilizing the 'ngram' module for string similarity. Input files are read based on user parameters, and output is written to a file specified by the user. No external network connections, system modifications, or code injection points are present. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behaviors. The use of 'open' without context managers is a minor concern but not malicious. Overall, the code functions as a data processing tool without malicious intent or harmful side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data processing script designed for CSV file similarity matching. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The use of open files without context managers is a minor code quality concern but not a security issue.",
