{
  "purpose": "The script performs a left similarity join between two CSV files based on n-gram similarity of specified columns.",
  "sources": "Reads input CSV files (left_path, right_path), reads command-line arguments, reads CSV data, uses n-gram library for similarity indexing",
  "sinks": "Writes output CSV file (outfile), potentially outputs data including matched rows, similarity scores, and rankings",
  "flows": "Reads CSV files and command-line parameters -> creates NGram index -> searches for similar rows -> writes matched or unmatched rows to output file",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no use of eval or exec, no suspicious network calls, no obfuscated code or dynamic code execution. Uses external 'ngram' library, which is acceptable if trusted.",
  "analysis": "The code loads CSV data and processes it to perform similarity joins using an external 'ngram' library. It accepts command-line arguments for flexibility and performs standard file checks. No suspicious or malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be a legitimate data processing utility. All data handling and library usage appear standard, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard CSV similarity join utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It performs expected file I/O operations and uses a reputable external library for n-gram processing. There are no indications of malware or security risks within this code.",
