  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external or untrusted data; the code is purely declarative configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration file for Sphinx documentation. It sets extensions, file suffixes, project info, language, copyright, exclude directories, Pygments style, and root document. There are no external data sources, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for Sphinx configuration. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
