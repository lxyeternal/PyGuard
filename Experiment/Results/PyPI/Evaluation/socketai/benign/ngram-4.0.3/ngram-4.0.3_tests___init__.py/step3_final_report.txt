  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "The code snippets or descriptions provided, including any input handling, data flows, or external interactions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, system modifications, network communications, or other untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "Paths from data sources (inputs) to sinks, including any code execution or data processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, obfuscation indicators, or unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or absent code content, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious indicators. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the descriptions. Confidence levels vary based on the amount of information, with higher confidence in reports with more detail. The low risk scores reflect the benign nature of the code, and the assessments are appropriate given the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports accurately assess the code as benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The scoring aligns with the content descriptions, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security posture based on these reports is very low risk.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
