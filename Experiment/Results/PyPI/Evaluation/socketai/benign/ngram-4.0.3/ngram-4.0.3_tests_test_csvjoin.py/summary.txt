  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test harness for an external CSV join utility. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities within this code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."
