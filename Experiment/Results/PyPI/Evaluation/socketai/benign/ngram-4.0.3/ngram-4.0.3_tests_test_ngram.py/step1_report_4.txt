  "purpose": "Unit testing for the ngram module, specifically testing NGram class methods and behaviors.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources; only local data used within test cases.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output to external systems; tests perform internal assertions only.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from source to sink; all data is predefined within the test cases.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code follows standard testing patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports unittest and a local ngram module, defining test cases for the NGram class. It uses static datasets for testing search and set operations, with no input/output beyond test assertions. No external data, user input, or network activity is involved. The logic focuses solely on verifying the correctness of the NGram implementation. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit testing script for a Python module, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. The code appears safe and intended solely for testing purposes.",
