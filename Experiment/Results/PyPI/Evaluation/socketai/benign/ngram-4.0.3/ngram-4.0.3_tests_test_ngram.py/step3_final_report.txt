{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the ngram module, verifying search, comparison, and set operations within the NGram class.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string data within test cases, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "In-memory data flow from test inputs to assertions; no external or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python unittest script testing the NGram class with static data. It performs searches, comparisons, and set operations without external dependencies or network activity. The code structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. All tests are self-contained and use hardcoded data, and no sensitive information or external data flows are present. The security posture is benign, and the code serves solely as a test suite for the NGram class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign unit testing script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All evidence supports a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
