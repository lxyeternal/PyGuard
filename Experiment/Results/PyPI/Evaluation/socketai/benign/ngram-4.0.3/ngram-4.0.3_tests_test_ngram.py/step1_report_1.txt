  "purpose": "Unit testing for the ngram module, verifying search and set operations.",
  "sources": "Importing 'unittest' module and 'NGram' class from ngram module.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks, network operations, or untrusted data handling are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (test strings) flows into NGram methods; no external data or untrusted sources are used.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard unit testing using Python's unittest framework for the NGram class. It defines test cases for searching and set operations, with no external data inputs or outputs, no network activity, and no suspicious code constructs. The code is straightforward, uses standard libraries, and only tests the functionality of the NGram class. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical test suite for the ngram module, containing no malicious behavior or security risks. It only exercises the NGram class's methods and does not perform any harmful operations.",
