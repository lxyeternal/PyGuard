{
  "purpose": "Unit testing the NGram class for search and set operations functionality.",
  "sources": "Importing 'unittest' and 'ngram' modules, using predefined item lists, and invoking methods on NGram instances.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data input or output functions, network operations, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code performs in-memory tests on the NGram class without external data flow or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. The code strictly performs unit tests on a local class.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a class 'NGram' to perform unit tests. It tests search functionality, set operations, and comparison methods. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code appears to be a straightforward test suite with no suspicious behaviors or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test script for the 'NGram' class, with no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated/malicious code. It solely performs in-memory tests without external interactions.",
