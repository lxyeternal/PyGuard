  "purpose": "Unit testing for the NGram module, verifying search and set operations functionality.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'ngram' module, using hardcoded string data within test cases.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or data sinks; all data used is hardcoded within test functions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests for a presumably external 'ngram' module. It creates instances of NGram with static datasets, performs searches, and validates results using assertions. No external input, environment variables, or network interactions are present. The code appears to be a standard testing script with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward test suite for the NGram class with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain obfuscated code or malware behavior.",
