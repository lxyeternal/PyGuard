{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for the ngram module to verify its functionality and correctness.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'ngram' module and uses its NGram class methods. It does not read untrusted input but tests internal functions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or file writes are present.",
  "flows": "The code creates instances of NGram, performs searches, comparisons, and set operations, all within a controlled test environment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward unit test code, following typical patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the NGram class and defines test cases to verify search and set operation functionalities. It uses standard unittest methods and assertions. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code performs in-memory computations with test data. No external data sources, network connections, or environment variables are accessed. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit test suite for the ngram module, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is safe and intended for verifying code correctness.",
