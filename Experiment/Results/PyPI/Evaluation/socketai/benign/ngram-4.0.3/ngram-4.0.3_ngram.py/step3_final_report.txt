  "purpose": "Implementation of an N-gram set class supporting lookup by string similarity, with set operations and search functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input items for indexing, string inputs for search and comparison, key functions for item string conversion.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data flows internally through string processing and set operations.",
  "flows": "Input items are processed into n-grams, stored in internal dictionaries, and used for similarity calculations during search and comparison.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Warnings about deprecated parameters are benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured implementation of an N-gram string similarity class. It performs internal data processing without external system calls or network activity. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are present. The set operations and search functions are standard and do not indicate sabotage or malicious intent. The warnings about deprecated parameters are benign and related to maintenance. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an N-gram based string similarity utility. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low security risk scores are appropriate given its purely computational nature. The code can be considered safe for use.",
