  "purpose": "Implementation of an NGram class for string similarity search and set operations based on N-gram analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are user-provided items added to the set, and the query strings used in search functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that could process or output untrusted data, but no explicit data exfiltration, network connections, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input items through padding and splitting into N-grams, stored in internal dictionaries, and is used in similarity calculations and search functions. No external network or system modification flows are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. The code is straightforward, with proper input validation and standard set and dictionary operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an NGram class for string similarity, including methods for adding, removing, and searching items based on N-gram analysis. It performs standard set operations and similarity calculations with clear input validation and warnings for deprecated parameters. No malicious behavior, such as network activity, system modification, or hidden backdoors, is detected. The logic is consistent with typical string similarity utilities, and the use of warnings and exception handling appears appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of an N-gram based search set, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It provides useful string similarity functions without any suspicious features or external side effects.",
