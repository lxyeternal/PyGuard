  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points that handle untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths exist; the code only calls a setup function without parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only invoking setuptools.setup() with default parameters; no suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls its setup() function with default arguments. There are no additional parameters, inputs, or data handling routines present. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated logic. Its simplicity aligns with standard packaging procedures.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard minimal setup script for packaging a Python module with setuptools. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
