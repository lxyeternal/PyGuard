  "purpose": "Import the version information from a local module to define the package's version.",
  "sources": "The local module '._version' which is imported to access the 'version' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code imports data from a local module to set __version__, with no data flow to external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with a standard shebang line and a straightforward import; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "This script primarily serves to set a version attribute by importing it from a local module. There is no user input, external data fetching, or data processing that could lead to vulnerabilities. The code is very minimal and appears standard for package versioning. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious behavior, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version import statement used for package versioning. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
