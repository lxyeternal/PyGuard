{
  "purpose": "The code imports a version string from a local module, likely for package versioning purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module ._version, specifically importing 'version'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the local module ._version into the '__version__' variable; no external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a version string from a relative module, which is common in Python packages for maintaining version info. There are no external inputs, no data manipulation, and no malicious indicators. Its structure is standard and simple.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving only to define the package version. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
