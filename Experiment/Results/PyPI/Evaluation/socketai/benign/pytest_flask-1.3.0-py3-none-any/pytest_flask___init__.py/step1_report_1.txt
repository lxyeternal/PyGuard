  "purpose": "Importing version information from a local module for package version tracking",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (_version.py)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; purely an import statement",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no suspicious or unusual constructs; no hardcoded credentials or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module, which is standard practice for version management. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity. The code does not include any user input, network operations, or executable code beyond the import. It appears to be a simple, safe component of a larger package.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving a typical purpose of importing version info. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
