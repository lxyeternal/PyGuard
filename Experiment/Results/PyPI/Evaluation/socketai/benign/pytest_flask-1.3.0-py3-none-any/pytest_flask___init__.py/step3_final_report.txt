  "purpose": "Import a version string from a local module for package version management.",
  "sources": "Local module '_version.py' where 'version' is defined.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output.",
  "flows": "Import statement reads 'version' from '_version.py' and assigns it to '__version__'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple shebang line followed by an import statement from a local module. It does not involve untrusted data, external inputs, or dynamic execution. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The import is typical for version management in Python packages, and the code's clarity indicates benign intent. All reports correctly identify this as a safe, standard pattern, with malware and obfuscation scores of 0 and security risk scores of 0. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version import statement with no malicious or security concerns. All assessments are accurate and consistent; no further action is needed.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
