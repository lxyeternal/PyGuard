  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: importing a version string from a local module (_version.py).\n- The code is standard practice for version management in Python packages.\n- No untrusted data, external network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are identified.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippets in all reports match the original code:\n  ```python\n  #!/usr/bin/env python\n  from ._version import version as __version__\n  ```\n- The logic is straightforward: importing a version string from a local module, which is common in package setup.\n\n### Error or Flaws:\n- No errors, flaws, or suspicious constructs are present in the code.\n- The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code segment.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0 or very close to 0, which is appropriate.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- Report 4 has a slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still reasonable given the simplicity.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there's no evidence of malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n- The malware score is correctly 0; no malicious intent is detected.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the clear, readable import statement.\n- The overall security risk is 0, as the code does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- All reports assume the local module `_version.py` is benign. If the content of `_version.py` were malicious, that could change the risk profile, but based on the provided code, the import itself is safe.\n- No external data or dynamic behavior is involved, so no vulnerabilities are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Note:** The overall security posture of this code segment is benign. If `_version.py` is also safe, then the entire component is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard, safe version import statement with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are appropriate.\n\n**My final estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.",
