  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same minimal code: a shebang line and an import statement from a local module `_version`.\n- The code's purpose is to import a version string for package versioning.\n- No untrusted data, external network activity, or data processing occurs.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign and standard practice.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code provided matches the description: it only imports a version string from a local module.\n- There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or code obfuscation.\n- The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are present in the code.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are also 0, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since all evidence points to benign, standard version import code, there is no justification for higher risk scores.\n- The malware score is correctly 0; no malicious behavior is indicated.\n- The obfuscated score is correctly 0; no obfuscation is present.\n- The overall security risk is correctly 0.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is simple and typical.\n- No potential vulnerabilities are implied by the code structure.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- Minor variation in confidence (0.9 vs 1) is acceptable and does not impact overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal, standard import statement used for version management. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis supply chain component is safe. No further action needed.",
