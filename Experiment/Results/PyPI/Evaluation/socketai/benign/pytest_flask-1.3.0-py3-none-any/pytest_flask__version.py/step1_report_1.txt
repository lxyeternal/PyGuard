  "purpose": "This code defines versioning information for a Python package, generated automatically by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting __version__, version, __version_tuple__, and version_tuple.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code assigns version strings and tuples to module-level variables without any data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed; the code is straightforward and auto-generated for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard generated file for managing package version info, with conditional typing support. It assigns static version strings and tuples to variables, with no external input, no code execution, and no data leakage. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The logic is simple and serves the purpose of version tracking only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely for version metadata management. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
