  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is an auto-generated version management snippet created by setuptools_scm.\n- It assigns static version strings and tuples to module-level variables.\n- It includes conditional type hinting imports, which are standard.\n- There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or data flows involving untrusted sources.\n- No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present.\n- The code's purpose is solely to maintain version metadata.\n\n**Assessment of each report:**\n\n1. **Report 1:**  \n   - **Verdict:** Accurate. The analysis correctly identifies the code as benign, straightforward, and auto-generated, with no malicious behavior.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n2. **Report 2:**  \n   - **Verdict:** Correct. The report correctly states that the code is for version info, with no suspicious patterns or external data handling.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n3. **Report 3:**  \n   - **Verdict:** Accurate. It notes the standard pattern, static assignments, and absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n4. **Report 4:**  \n   - **Verdict:** Correct. The code is straightforward, with no external data or suspicious patterns.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n5. **Report 5:**  \n   - **Verdict:** Correct. It recognizes the code as benign, auto-generated, with no malicious intent.  \n   - **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The scores assigned (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0) are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The logic and reasoning in each report are sound and align with the code's purpose.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- Given the static, straightforward nature of the code, I agree with the provided scores.\n- There is no indication of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- The code is a standard auto-generated version info snippet, with no suspicious features.\n\n**Final notes:**\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- The code poses no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nAll assessments are consistent and justified.",
