  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package, generated by setuptools_scm, to manage versioning metadata.",
  "sources": "The code assigns version strings and tuples, and conditionally imports typing information.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows leading to untrusted operations or external data effects.",
  "flows": "The version string and tuple are assigned directly; no untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains conditional typing imports, but nothing unusual or suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares version variables and imports type annotations conditionally. It is a standard pattern for version management in Python projects. No malicious or suspicious patterns are observed; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign version declaration snippet generated by setuptools_scm. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
