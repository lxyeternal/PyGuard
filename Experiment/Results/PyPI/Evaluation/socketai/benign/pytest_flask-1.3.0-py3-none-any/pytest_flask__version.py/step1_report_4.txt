  "purpose": "This code defines version information for a Python package generated by setuptools_scm, primarily used for version tracking and consistency.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements for __version__, version, __version_tuple__, and version_tuple.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Direct assignments from hardcoded string and tuple to version variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version-related variables with static, hardcoded values, which is typical in version management scripts. The conditional import and type annotations are standard for type hinting and do not introduce any malicious activity. No external inputs, network calls, or sensitive data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration script generated by setuptools_scm. It contains no malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks.",
