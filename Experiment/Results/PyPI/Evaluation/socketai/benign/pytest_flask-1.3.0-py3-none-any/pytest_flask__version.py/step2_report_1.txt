  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Review & Data Flow**:\n   - The code is a straightforward, auto-generated version management script.\n   - All assignments are static, hardcoded strings and tuples.\n   - There are no external inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n   - No untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.\n   - The conditional import for type checking is standard practice and not suspicious.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report**:\n   - The reports uniformly conclude the code is benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n   - They correctly identify the code as standard version info management, generated by setuptools_scm.\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - malware: 0\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These seem appropriate given the static, harmless nature of the code.\n   - The confidence score is 1, reflecting certainty in benignity.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions**:\n   - The code does not contain any suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - No indication of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n   - The only possible concern could be if the version info was maliciously altered, but since this is auto-generated and static, that risk is negligible.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment & Personal Estimate**:\n   - The malware score should remain at **0**.\n   - The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n   - The security risk score should be **0**.\n   - The confidence score is justified at **1**.\n\n**Final Justification**:\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated version management snippet.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Summary**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis review confirms the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
