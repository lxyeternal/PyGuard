  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is auto-generated by setuptools_scm.\n- The code solely assigns static version strings and tuples to module-level variables.\n- No untrusted data sources, external inputs, or dynamic code execution are involved.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are present.\n- The purpose is purely version management and metadata declaration.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code uses conditional type hinting imports, which is standard and not suspicious.\n- All data are static, hardcoded assignments, with no data flow from external sources.\n- No network activity, code execution, or data leakage is evident.\n\n**Scores and reasoning:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This is appropriate; no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports. The code is straightforward and auto-generated, with no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk score:** 0 in all reports. The code does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**\nYes. Given the static, benign nature of the code, the scores align with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or assumptions:**\n- The reports correctly identify the code as benign and auto-generated.\n- No claims of vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made, and none are justified.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is purely for version metadata management.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No further action or concern is necessary.",
