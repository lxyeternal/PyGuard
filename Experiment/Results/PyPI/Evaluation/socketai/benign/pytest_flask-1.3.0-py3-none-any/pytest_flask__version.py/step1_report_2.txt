  "purpose": "Define and assign version information for the package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string and version tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of version-related variable definitions, with conditional type hinting imports. All data are statically assigned version strings and tuples. No external input, no data leakage, no suspicious code behavior. The code comments indicate it is auto-generated by setuptools_scm, a common version management tool.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely for version metadata declaration, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
