  "purpose": "Version metadata management, auto-generated by setuptools_scm",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version strings and tuples, conditional type hinting import",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external inputs involved",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignments",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static code, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, auto-generated version info snippet with static version strings and tuples. It includes a conditional import for type checking, which is standard. There are no external inputs, dynamic code execution, or data flows involving untrusted sources. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is solely to maintain version metadata. All signals indicate benign, straightforward code with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, auto-generated version management code with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriately set to zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence in this assessment.",
