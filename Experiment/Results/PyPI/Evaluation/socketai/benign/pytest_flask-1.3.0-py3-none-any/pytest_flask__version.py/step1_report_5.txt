  "purpose": "Define version information for a package, generated by setuptools_scm.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, imports within a TYPE_CHECKING block.",
  "targets": "None specifically, as no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Initialization of version variables based on static assignment; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; the code is standard for versioning and type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining version variables for a package. It uses conditional imports for type checking purposes and assigns static version data. There are no signs of malicious logic, data leaks, or external communications. The structure is typical for auto-generated version info. No suspicious behavior or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated version definition snippet with no malicious intent or security issues.",
