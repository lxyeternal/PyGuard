  "purpose": "Retrieve a fixture value from a request object, supporting multiple method signatures.",
  "sources": "The request object and the 'value' parameter.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not process untrusted data directly or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "The function checks for 'getfixturevalue' method; if present, it calls it with 'value'; otherwise, it calls 'getfuncargvalue' with 'value'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior detected. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a compatibility layer for retrieving fixture values from a request object, first attempting to call 'getfixturevalue', then falling back to 'getfuncargvalue'. Both methods are called with the same 'value' argument. There are no suspicious data flows, external network calls, or security-sensitive operations. The code is simple, intended for testing or fixture retrieval, with no evident malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility function for fixture retrieval with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It contains no suspicious code or malicious payloads.",
