  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code consists of straightforward utility functions: a deprecation decorator, server name rewriting, scope determination, and accept header creation.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or file I/O are present.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- The functions perform simple string manipulations and warnings, which are standard practices.\n- The confidence levels are all at 1, indicating high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated scores are also 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n\n**Security Risk Scores:**\n- Most reports assign a security risk of 0 or 0.1, citing the lack of external data flows or dangerous operations.\n- Given the code's benign nature, a security risk score of 0 seems appropriate.\n\n**Critical Evaluation:**\n- No issues are present in the code snippets or the reasoning of the reports.\n- The logic is sound, and the operations are safe.\n- The functions are typical utility functions used in many codebases for deprecation warnings and string manipulations.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- None identified. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The assigned scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a set of standard utility functions with no malicious or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scoring reflects the benign nature of the code.",
