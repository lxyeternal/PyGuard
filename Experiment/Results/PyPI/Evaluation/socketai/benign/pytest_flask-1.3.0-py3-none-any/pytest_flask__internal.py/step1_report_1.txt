{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for deprecation warnings, server name rewriting, scope determination, and creating accept headers, likely for use in web server or API client contexts.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted data input sources are present. Functions receive parameters, but no input validation or user input handling is shown.",
  "sinks": "The functions do not write to files, execute system commands, or perform network operations. No data is sent to external systems or potentially malicious sinks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; functions operate on parameters without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The functions are straightforward utility implementations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a deprecation decorator, server name rewriting, scope determination, and accept header creation. All functions perform simple, safe operations without external dependencies or side effects. No malicious patterns, code injection points, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or data leaks. Overall, the code is safe.",
