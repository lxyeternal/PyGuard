{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for deprecation warnings, server name rewriting, scope determination, and header creation, likely for a larger application or testing framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters such as 'server_name', 'new_port', 'fixture_name', 'config', and 'mimetype'. It also accesses configuration via 'config.getini'.",
  "sinks": "No insecure data handling or untrusted data sinks are present. The functions mainly manipulate strings and emit warnings without involving external system calls or sensitive data transmission.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed to generate modified server names, determine scope from config, or produce header tuples, without complex or suspicious data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code structures are detected. The code follows standard patterns without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains helper functions: 'deprecated' for warning about deprecated functions, '_rewrite_server_name' for modifying server address strings, '_determine_scope' for retrieving config values, and '_make_accept_header' for creating HTTP headers. All functions are straightforward, with no external system interactions or data leaks. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, utility-focused, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a testing or configuration framework, providing standard functionality without any suspicious or harmful features.",
