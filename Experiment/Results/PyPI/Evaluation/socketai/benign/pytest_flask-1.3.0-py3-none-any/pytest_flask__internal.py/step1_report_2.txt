{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for deprecation warnings, server name rewriting, configuration scope determination, and header creation, likely for a web server or testing framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as 'server_name', 'new_port', 'mimetype', 'fixture_name', and 'config' objects.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe sinks include the splitting and rejoining of server name strings which could be manipulated if inputs are untrusted; no direct dangerous actions like network access, file modification, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "flows": "Inputs from function parameters are processed and returned or used to modify strings; there are no external data flows or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated patterns are observed. Use of warnings for deprecation is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple, standard utility functions: a decorator for issuing deprecation warnings, a function to replace the port in a server name string, a configuration scope getter, and a header generator. All functions perform straightforward operations with no external dependencies or risky behaviors. There are no signs of malicious intent or malware. The code appears clean, well-structured, and aligned with common coding practices.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be utility code for server configuration and deprecation handling with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
