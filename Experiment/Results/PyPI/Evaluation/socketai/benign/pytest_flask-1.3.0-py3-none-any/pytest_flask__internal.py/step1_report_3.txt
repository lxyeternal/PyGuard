{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for deprecation warnings, server name rewriting, scope determination, and header creation, likely for a server or API testing framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data via `config.getini`, and function arguments such as `server_name`, `new_port`, and `mimetype`.",
  "sinks": "The code uses `warnings.warn` to emit deprecation warnings, which are safe. No other sinks, such as data leaks or external calls, are present.",
  "flows": "Input data from function parameters and configuration flows through functions to produce modified strings or headers; no untrusted external sources or outputs are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are observed. The functions perform straightforward string manipulations and warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code contains well-defined utility functions: one for emitting deprecation warnings, one for rewriting server names by replacing ports, one for retrieving scope settings from configuration, and one for creating an accept header. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code obfuscation, or suspicious activity. All functions perform standard operations with no external network calls, data exfiltration, or dangerous code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions intended for server configuration and testing purposes. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks within this code segment.",
