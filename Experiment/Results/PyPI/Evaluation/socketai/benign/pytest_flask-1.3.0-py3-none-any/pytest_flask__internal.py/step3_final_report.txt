  "purpose": "Utility functions for deprecation warnings, server name rewriting, scope determination, and header creation.",
  "sources": "Function parameters and configuration objects; no external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Warnings emitted via warnings.warn; string manipulations; configuration retrieval.",
  "flows": "Input parameters or config data are processed and returned or used in warnings; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward utility functions performing string operations, issuing warnings, and accessing configuration data. There are no external data sources, network calls, or file I/O. The functions are well-structured, simple, and standard. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The warnings are standard practice and do not indicate malicious intent. The string manipulation in '_rewrite_server_name' could be misused if inputs are malicious, but this is a benign pattern in controlled contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The functions serve typical utility purposes and do not perform any harmful actions. The assigned scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
