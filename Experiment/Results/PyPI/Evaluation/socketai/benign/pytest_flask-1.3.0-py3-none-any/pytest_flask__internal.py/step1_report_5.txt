{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for deprecation warnings, server name rewriting, scope determination, and header creation, likely used in a server or application configuration context.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are explicitly read; the code primarily processes parameters passed to functions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; functions return processed data without external effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (like server_name, fixture_name, config, mimetype) flow through functions without external data interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple utility functions, including a deprecation decorator, server name string manipulation, scope determination from configuration, and header creation. No external data sources, network operations, or security-sensitive actions are evident. The functions perform straightforward string and configuration manipulations with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads. Overall, it is safe and standard for its intended purpose.",
