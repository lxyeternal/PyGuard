  "purpose": "Provides testing helpers and fixtures for Flask applications, including response class modification, request context management, and configuration setup for testing environments.",
  "sources": "Fixtures, request markers, app configuration, and response class attributes within the test setup.",
  "sinks": "Monkeypatching response_class and app.config, request context push/pop, all confined to testing scope with no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Fixtures and markers influence response class and app config; monkeypatching modifies behavior during tests without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; all modifications are standard for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Flask testing utility involving monkeypatching response classes, managing request contexts, and passing configuration options via pytest fixtures and markers. It does not perform any network activity, external data handling, or contain obfuscated/malicious code. The modifications are confined to the test environment and do not impact production systems. The logic is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard testing utility for Flask applications, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
