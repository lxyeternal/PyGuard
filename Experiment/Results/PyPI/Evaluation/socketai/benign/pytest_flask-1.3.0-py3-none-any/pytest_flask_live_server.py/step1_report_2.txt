{
  "purpose": "This code manages a live server process for testing purposes, including starting, stopping, and checking server readiness.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from socket connections, process management (multiprocessing), and environment signals (os.kill).",
  "sinks": "The process termination and signal sending could affect process control, but are typical for server management. No data leakage or malicious data handling identified.",
  "flows": "The server startup initiates a subprocess that runs an application, then checks socket connectivity to verify readiness. On stop, signals are sent to terminate the process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The use of os.kill and process management appears standard for server control. No obfuscated or misleading code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a server process, starts it in a separate process, and verifies its readiness via socket connection. The process can be cleanly or forcefully terminated, with error logging. It uses standard libraries and patterns typical for server testing and management. No indicators of malicious intent or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are present. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate server management utility used for testing or development purposes. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
