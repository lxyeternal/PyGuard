{
  "purpose": "Manage the lifecycle of a live server process for testing purposes, including starting, checking readiness, and stopping the server.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to methods (app, host, port, wait, clean_stop), socket connections for readiness check, OS signals for process termination.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection attempts, process termination via os.kill, process.join, process.terminate, logging errors.",
  "flows": "start() creates a process to run the app, repeatedly checks if server is ready via socket connection, stop() terminates process possibly via SIGINT.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious external network calls, no obfuscated or unusual code constructs. The process management appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a LiveServer class for testing, which creates a subprocess to run a web application. It includes process start/stop methods, readiness checks via socket connection, and clean shutdown attempts using signals. The socket connection for readiness is standard, and process termination follows typical patterns. No malicious or suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or credential leaks are present. The code relies on standard libraries and practices for process management and socket communication, with no hidden or obfuscated components.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate helper class for managing test server processes, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard techniques for process control and server readiness verification. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
