{
  "purpose": "The code manages the lifecycle of a live server for testing purposes, including starting, checking readiness, and stopping the server process.",
  "sources": "Input data includes parameters for host, port, wait time, and the app object; socket connections for server readiness check; signals for process control.",
  "sinks": "Process termination via os.kill; socket connections for health checks; process join and terminate calls.",
  "flows": "The server start method initiates a subprocess that runs the app; readiness check attempts socket connection; stop method terminates or cleanly stops the process via signals.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns observed; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors. Use of multiprocessing and socket is standard for server management.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages a server process lifecycle for testing, with standard practices such as subprocess handling, socket connection checks, and signal-based termination. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The process control is straightforward, and all external interactions are typical for server testing utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal testing utility for managing server processes. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It effectively manages server startup, health checks, and shutdown without any suspicious activity.",
