{
  "purpose": "The code manages a server process for testing purposes, including starting, checking readiness via socket, and stopping the server with clean signals or termination.",
  "sources": "Socket connection attempts for readiness check; process creation via multiprocessing; os.kill for process termination.",
  "sinks": "Socket connection failures; process termination signals; process join for clean shutdown.",
  "flows": "Start server process -> socket connection check -> process runs -> stop process via signal or terminate.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials; straightforward process management; no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard libraries and techniques for process control and socket communication. It performs process startup, readiness verification, and shutdown in a typical manner. No external untrusted data handling beyond socket checks, no obfuscated code, and no malicious network activity are present. The use of signals and process termination is conventional. Overall, the code appears benign and intended solely for testing server applications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for managing test server processes with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The overall assessment indicates a safe, benign implementation.",
