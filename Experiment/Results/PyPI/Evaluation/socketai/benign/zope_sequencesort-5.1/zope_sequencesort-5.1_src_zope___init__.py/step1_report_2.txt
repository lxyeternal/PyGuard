  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls declare_namespace with __name__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The import leads to the declaration of the namespace; no data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal and common pattern used in Python namespace packages. It imports the 'pkg_resources' module and declares the current package as a namespace, which is a standard practice. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code is straightforward and aligned with typical package setup patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace declaration without any malicious intent or security issues.",
