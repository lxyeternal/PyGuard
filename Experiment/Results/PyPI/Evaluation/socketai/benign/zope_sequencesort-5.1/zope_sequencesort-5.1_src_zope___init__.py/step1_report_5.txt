  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package using pkg_resources for package organization",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls declare_namespace with __name__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__('pkg_resources') is somewhat uncommon but not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkg_resources' module and declares the current package as a namespace package. This is a standard practice in Python packaging to allow multiple packages to share the same namespace. There are no input/output operations, no data leaks, nor any malicious code. The import statement and the call to declare_namespace are straightforward and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical namespace declaration for Python packages using pkg_resources. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
