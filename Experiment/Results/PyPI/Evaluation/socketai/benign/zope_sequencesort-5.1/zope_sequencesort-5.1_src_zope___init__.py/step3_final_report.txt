  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package using pkg_resources' declare_namespace method.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' dynamically via __import__('pkg_resources').",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls declare_namespace(__name__), with no data flow beyond this call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a minimal, standard namespace declaration pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code uses __import__ with a string literal to import 'pkg_resources', then calls declare_namespace(__name__). This is a common, legitimate pattern for defining namespace packages in Python, especially in older packaging standards. No data flows, no input/output, no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The pattern is straightforward and widely used in package organization. All reports correctly identify this as a benign, standard practice. The malware score is appropriately 0, as there is no malicious intent or activity. The security risk score is 0, reflecting the benign nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and commonality of the pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration in Python with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. The code poses no security concern.",
