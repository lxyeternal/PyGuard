  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls 'declare_namespace' with the current module name",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code simply declares a namespace",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with string literal is normal; no unusual code or secrets detected. No obfuscation or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares the current package as a namespace package, which is standard practice for namespace packages. No data input, no untrusted data handling, and no malicious actions are evident. The code does not contain obfuscated logic or hidden functionalities. It is a minimal and legitimate statement used in Python package namespace declarations.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace declaration with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is safe and common in Python packaging.",
