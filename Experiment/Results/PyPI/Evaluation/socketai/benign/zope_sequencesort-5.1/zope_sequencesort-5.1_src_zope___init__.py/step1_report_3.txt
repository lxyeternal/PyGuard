  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs beyond the namespace declaration; no source-to-sink paths exist.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace package declaration; no suspicious or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and declares the current package as a namespace package using declare_namespace(__name__). This is a common pattern in Python for setting up namespace packages, especially in older Python packaging styles. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and serves a clear, legitimate purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard namespace package declaration with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
