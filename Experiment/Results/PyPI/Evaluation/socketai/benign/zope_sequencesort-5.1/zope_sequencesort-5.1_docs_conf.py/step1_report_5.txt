  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no data leaks or external interactions are identified.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are assigned and utilized internally within the Sphinx build process; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code detected. All code appears to be standard configuration for documentation generation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static configuration data for Sphinx, including extension lists, paths, project info, and output options. No input handling, data processing, network communication, or executable logic is present. It adheres to typical Sphinx setup patterns without suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The file is a standard, benign Sphinx configuration script for documentation purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears safe and typical for its intended purpose.",
