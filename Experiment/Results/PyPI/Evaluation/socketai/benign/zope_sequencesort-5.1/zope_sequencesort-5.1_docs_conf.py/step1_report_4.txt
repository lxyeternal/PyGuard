  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. The file is a standard Sphinx config with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated segments.",
  "analysis": "The file is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration with static assignments, comments, and extension declarations. There are no code execution, input handling, or data transmission points. No suspicious variables, functions, or code patterns are present. The content is solely related to documentation build setup, with no signs of malicious or maliciously-inclined code. Since the file contains only configuration data, it does not interact with external inputs or outputs.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard Sphinx configuration file with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is purely static and intended for documentation purposes only.",
