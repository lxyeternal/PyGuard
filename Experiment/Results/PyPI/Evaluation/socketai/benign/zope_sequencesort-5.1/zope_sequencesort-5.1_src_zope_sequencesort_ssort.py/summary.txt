  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, flexible sorting utility with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of the external namespace `_`. If `_` is controlled by an attacker, malicious functions could be invoked, but this is a known pattern in customizable sorting utilities. Therefore, the malware score remains 0, obfuscated score 0, and a moderate risk score (~0.2) is justified. The reports are consistent and accurate; no modifications are necessary."
