{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python package setup script for 'zope.sequencesort', used to configure package metadata, dependencies, and installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads local files 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' for long description; no untrusted input sources or dynamic data processing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no network activity, data leaks, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Reads local documentation files and passes static metadata to setuptools.setup(); no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static setup script that imports standard modules, reads local documentation files, and invokes setuptools.setup() with package info. There are no dynamic inputs, network operations, or obfuscated constructs. All patterns align with typical package configuration scripts, with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard package setup tasks without any malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as a safe, static configuration script. The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are appropriately zero.",
