  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \nThe provided code is a standard Python setup script for the package `zope.sequencesort`. It imports common modules (`os`, `setuptools`), defines a simple `read()` function to load documentation files, and calls `setup()` with package metadata, dependencies, and configuration options. The script performs static file reads and package setup tasks without any dynamic or runtime code execution, user input processing, network activity, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed observations:\n- No untrusted data processing.\n- No dynamic code execution.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials.\n- No signs of malicious intent.\n- The code is typical for a Python package setup.\n\n### Malware assessment:\n- All reports agree that the code is benign and performs standard setup operations.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior or code injection.\n- Malware score should be **0**.\n\n### Obfuscated code:\n- The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- Obfuscated score should be **0**.\n\n### Risk score:\n- Since the code is purely static configuration with no security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior, the overall risk score should be **0**.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No report suggests any suspicious or malicious activity.\n- The code does not process untrusted input or perform any network operations.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**\n- **Risk score:** **0**\n\nThis aligns with the consensus of the reports and the actual code behavior.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores should be set to zero across all categories.",
