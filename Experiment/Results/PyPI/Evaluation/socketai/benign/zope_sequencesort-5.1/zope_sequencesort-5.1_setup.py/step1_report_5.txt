{
  "purpose": "The script is for setting up and configuring the 'zope.sequencesort' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and packaging information.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' for long description, and importing standard setup tools functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup parameters are static, and file reading is from local package files.",
  "flows": "Reading local files to generate long_description during setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs standard package setup tasks with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard setup tools, reads local files for description content, and calls setup() with static metadata and dependencies. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution occurs. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated segments are present. The structure is straightforward and consistent with typical Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
