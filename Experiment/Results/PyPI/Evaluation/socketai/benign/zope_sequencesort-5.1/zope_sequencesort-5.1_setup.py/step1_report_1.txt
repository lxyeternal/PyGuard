{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the zope.sequencesort package, including metadata, dependencies, and package discovery.",
  "sources": "Reading files ('README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst') for long description; importing modules os, setuptools; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or user inputs processed in a security-sensitive way.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code performs static setup tasks without processing untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code observed. The code performs standard setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, defines a function to read files, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity occurs. The files read are static files for documentation. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, backdoors, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs static configuration without any dangerous operations.",
