  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the zope.sequencesort package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "File system operations (reading README.rst and CHANGES.rst), package metadata inputs, and package discovery functions.",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Reading files during setup to assemble long description, and package discovery for installation.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static setup tasks typical for Python packages, such as reading files for long descriptions and configuring package metadata. There are no apparent sources of untrusted input that could lead to data leaks or code injection. The package discovery, dependency declaration, and metadata are straightforward and standard. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads local files for documentation and defines package metadata and dependencies, all of which are typical and safe.",
