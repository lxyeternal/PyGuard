  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a license header plus an import statement from `zope.sequencesort.ssort`.\n- The import is marked as unused (`# noqa: F401`), indicating it’s possibly a placeholder or part of a larger module.\n- No dynamic data, no input/output, no network activity, no code execution beyond static import.\n- The library `zope.sequencesort` is an open-source package, well-known in Python community.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code snippet is purely static, containing only comments and an import statement.\n- The import statement does not execute any code or process data.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- The import is unused, which might suggest incomplete code or a placeholder, but this is benign.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent; they correctly identify the code as benign and non-malicious.\n- No logical errors are present in the reasoning.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- The security risk scores are 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n- Confidence scores are high (0.9–1), justified given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code contains only a static import from a reputable open-source library, there is no reason to assign a risk higher than 0.\n- The import being unused does not increase risk; it may be part of a larger codebase.\n\n### Malware and obfuscation:\n- Both are correctly scored as 0; no malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities:\n- The reports correctly dismiss any assumptions of vulnerabilities based solely on an import statement.\n- No vulnerabilities are claimed or implied beyond the benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (benign, no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**In conclusion:**\nThe reports are accurate. The code is a standard, benign header with an import statement that is unused but harmless. No security concerns are present here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
