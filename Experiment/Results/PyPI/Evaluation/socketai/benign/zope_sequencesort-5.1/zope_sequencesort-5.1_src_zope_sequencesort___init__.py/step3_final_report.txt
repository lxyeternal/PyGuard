  "purpose": "License header and an unused import statement from a known open-source library.",
  "sources": "Static comments and the import statement from 'zope.sequencesort.ssort'.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow, input, output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static import without execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import marked with '# noqa: F401'; no malicious code or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only licensing comments and a static import from a reputable open-source package. The import is unused, which is benign and common in stub or placeholder files. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not process data, interact with the network, or execute any dynamic code. The import's unused status does not pose a security risk. All signals indicate a benign, structural code snippet with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, static header with an unused import from a trusted library. There is no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores are appropriately set to zero across malware, obfuscation, and security risk categories, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
