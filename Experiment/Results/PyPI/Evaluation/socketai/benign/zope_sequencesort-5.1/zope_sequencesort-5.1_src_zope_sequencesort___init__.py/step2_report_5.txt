  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a license header plus an import statement from `zope.sequencesort.ssort`.\n- The import is marked as unused (`# noqa: F401`), which suggests it's either placeholder or part of a larger codebase.\n- No dynamic data, input/output, or runtime behavior is present.\n- The package `zope.sequencesort` is an open-source library, not known for malicious activity.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious payloads are indicated.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- The code is a static header plus an import statement. No executable code, data processing, or dynamic behavior.\n- The import statement is unused but benign.\n- **No security issues or malicious code are present.**\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The only potential flaw is the unused import, which might indicate incomplete code or unnecessary dependency inclusion, but this is not a security concern.\n- No logical errors or malicious intent.\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0 or very low (e.g., 0.0 or 0.1). Given no malicious activity, this is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; all scores are low, reflecting no threat.\n\n### Potential issues with the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable; they recognize the code as benign.\n- No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities; they correctly identify the code as harmless.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis: the code is a simple, benign license header and import statement with no malicious or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is harmless, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The reports are accurate, and no changes are necessary.",
