  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal placeholder comment indicating a Python package, with no executable code or security-related content.",
  "sources": "There are no data sources; the code contains only a comment string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present, as the code is non-executable.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist due to the absence of code logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is just a comment with no suspicious or unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single comment string '\"Python package.\"' with no functions, dependencies, or executable statements. Given its trivial nature, there are no security risks, malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or data leaks. The assessments across reports are consistent and accurate, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with full confidence. No anomalies or suspicious activity are present, and the code does not interact with any external inputs or outputs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder comment with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. No further action or re-evaluation is necessary.",
