{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'types-openpyxl' Python package, primarily providing type stub files for static type checking tools.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, including name, description, long description, URLs, package data, and dependencies; all hardcoded within the script.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code is static and solely for package configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration without dynamic data or untrusted sources; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script using setuptools, containing static strings and a single setup() call. It includes no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscation. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0. The package data consists of type stub files, typical for type hinting purposes. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present. The scores are consistent with the code's static, well-documented structure. No logical flaws or security issues are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It poses no supply chain threat and is safe for use.",
