{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package 'types-openpyxl', including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the hardcoded strings and lists within the setup() function, such as package data paths and URLs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of setup() functions and package data registration, but these are standard for package configuration and do not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely configures package metadata and data files.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive package data paths and metadata but shows no signs of unusual code execution, hidden backdoors, or malicious data handling. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical setup configuration script using setuptools for Python packaging. It specifies package information, dependencies, package data, URLs, and classifiers. All data appears to be static and intended for package distribution. There are no functions executing dynamic code, no input handling, and no suspicious behaviors. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or anomalies. It does not perform any runtime data processing, network access, or system modification beyond standard package setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration for a Python package with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It is safe and does not pose a supply chain risk.",
