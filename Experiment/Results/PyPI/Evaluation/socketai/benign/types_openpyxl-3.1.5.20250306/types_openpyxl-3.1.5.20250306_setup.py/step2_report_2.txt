  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a straightforward setup script using setuptools.\n- It defines static package metadata, including name, version, description, long description, URLs, classifiers, package data, and dependencies.\n- All data is hardcoded; no user input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution.\n- The package data consists of numerous `.pyi` stub files for type checking, typical for a type stub package.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of code:** The code is a standard setup configuration; no issues or malicious code detected.\n- **Malicious activity:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity.\n- **Data flow:** Static data, no untrusted sources involved.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **None identified.** The code adheres to standard practices for Python package setup scripts.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks detected.\n\n### Justification:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a standard, benign setup script.\n- The high confidence scores (1) are justified given the static, straightforward nature.\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior that warrants a higher risk or malware score.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The package is a legitimate, non-malicious setup configuration for a type stub package.\n- The scores across all reports are consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### My final estimates:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The package setup code is benign, standard, and safe. No further action or warnings are necessary.",
