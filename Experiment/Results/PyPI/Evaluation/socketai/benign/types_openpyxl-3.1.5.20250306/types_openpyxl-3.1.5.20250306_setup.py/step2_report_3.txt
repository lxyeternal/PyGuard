  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward, static setup script for a Python package, with no dynamic code, no user input, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior.\n- The code is a standard package configuration using 'setuptools', with hardcoded metadata, URLs, package data, and no external dependencies or data flows.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks are evident from the code or the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed observations:\n\n- The code is static and contains no untrusted data sources.\n- No code injection, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present.\n- The package data is extensive but consists solely of stub files (.pyi), typical for type stub packages.\n- The purpose is purely to facilitate type checking for the 'openpyxl' library.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n\n- None identified. The reports correctly interpret the code as a benign setup script.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate.\n\n### Scores review:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the static, benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports justify a higher risk score; all are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n\n- The reports assume that static code equals safety, which is reasonable here.\n- No external or dynamic behaviors are involved that could introduce risks.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nBased on the provided code and reports, **there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks**.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Metric            | Score |\n|-------------------|---------|\n| Malware           | 0       |\n| Obfuscated        | 0       |\n| Security Risk     | 0       |\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard, static setup script for a Python package, with no dynamic or suspicious elements. It does not perform any runtime actions, network operations, or data handling beyond package configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is safe, benign, and poses no supply chain security risk.",
