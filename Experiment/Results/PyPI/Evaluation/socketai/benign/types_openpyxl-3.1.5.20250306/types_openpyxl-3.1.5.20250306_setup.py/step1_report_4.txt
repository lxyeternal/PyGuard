{
  "purpose": "The code defines and configures a Python package for type stubs related to openpyxl, mainly for type checking purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'setup' function parameters and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that process untrusted data; the code only sets up package metadata and dependencies.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static configuration and package metadata into package distribution, with no dynamic data or external untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The package setup is standard, with no obfuscated or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly performs package setup using 'setuptools', specifying package metadata, dependencies, and data files. It contains no user input handling, network communication, or code execution that could be malicious. All operations are static and standard for Python package configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package containing type stubs. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated code. It is safe and standard in nature.",
