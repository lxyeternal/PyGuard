  "purpose": "Static configuration script for Sphinx documentation, setting URLs, extensions, and regex patterns.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded URLs, extension lists, regex patterns, and static strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external output; static setup only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or secrets; straightforward static setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines static URLs and regex patterns, and sets configuration options for Sphinx. It does not process user input, environment variables, or perform network operations. URL parsing and regex are used safely with static data. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present, and the code structure is clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration script for documentation with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
