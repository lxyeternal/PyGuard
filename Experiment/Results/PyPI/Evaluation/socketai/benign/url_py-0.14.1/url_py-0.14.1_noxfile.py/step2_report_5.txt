  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard project setup, no suspicious code.\n- **Sinks:** `session.run` calls are typical; no malicious commands detected.\n- **Flows:** Data from configuration files and user parameters into subprocesses—standard.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Routine CI/CD setup; no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, considering the subprocess calls, but no real risk here)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and justified. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard automation tasks.\n- No suspicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Uses well-known tools; no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Also describes standard automation for testing, building, etc.\n- No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- Operations are typical.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar assessment: standard project automation.\n- No malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no secrets.\n- External commands are typical.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1 (slightly lower, given no issues)\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Also describes standard nox automation tasks.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- Uses common tools and patterns.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, all reports correctly identify the code as standard automation scripts.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None apparent; all reports correctly interpret the code.\n- **Scores:** All are consistent with the analysis; malware scores are 0, obfuscated scores are 0, and risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The **malware scores** are accurate at 0 across all reports.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are also appropriate at 0.\n- The **risk scores** are justified as low, given the nature of the code.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, since the code is purely automation without external untrusted input that could cause harm)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is a typical, safe project automation script with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scores reflect this correctly.",
