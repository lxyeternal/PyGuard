  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context or comments, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external libraries or modules.",
  "sinks": "Data can flow into print statements, network connections, file operations, or database queries, if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters, environment variables) through processing functions towards outputs like network calls, file writes, or logs.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation detected. No unusual code constructs or hidden behaviors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard Python modules and functions. No suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious logic detected. Usage of environment variables appears typical. No dangerous SQL or code injection points are evident. The structure suggests standard data processing routines. Without further context, no malicious intent or security issues are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or security flaws. However, a more thorough review with complete context could provide additional assurance.",
