  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, file reads, network activity, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input flow into eval/exec or network transmission points, potentially leading to data exfiltration or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, use of eval/exec, obfuscated control flow, network activity for exfiltration, dynamic code execution, suspicious strings.",
  "analysis": "The code shows signs of malicious intent in report 5, including eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, network activity, and obfuscation, justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. The other reports lack explicit code snippets or suspicious patterns, leading to low malware and risk scores. The scores are consistent with the descriptions; the high confidence in benign reports is acceptable given the absence of evidence. The overall assessment aligns with the evidence presented, with report 5 warranting further review due to its indicators.",
  "conclusion": "Report 5 demonstrates likely malicious behavior supported by concrete indicators, justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. The other reports are benign, with scores reflecting their lack of suspicious activity. The scoring is consistent and appropriate.",
