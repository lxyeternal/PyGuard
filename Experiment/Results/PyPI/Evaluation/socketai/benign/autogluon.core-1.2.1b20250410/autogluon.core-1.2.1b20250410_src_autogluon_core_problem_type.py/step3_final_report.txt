  "purpose": "Defines classes and a static dictionary to represent machine learning problem types and their capabilities, serving as configuration or metadata.",
  "sources": "Constants imported from .constants; static class definitions and data structures.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network operations, or external data processing present.",
  "flows": "Static data structures initialized at module load; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Minor bug in list_problem_types() method: returns [self.problem_type_dict.keys()] instead of list(self.problem_type_dict.keys()).",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, straightforward data model with no external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. It defines classes to encapsulate problem type info and initializes a dictionary with predefined problem types. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The only minor issue is the implementation of list_problem_types(), which should return a list of keys rather than a list containing a dict_keys object. The code's purpose is purely configuration, with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the code as benign and assign malware and security risk scores of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static data model for ML problem types with no malicious or security concerns. The only correction needed is in the list_problem_types() method for proper functionality, but this does not impact security. The assigned malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
