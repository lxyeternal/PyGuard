{
  "purpose": "Define classes and data structures to represent and manage different problem types for machine learning models, including their prediction capabilities and classification status.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class constructors, dictionary initializations, and method calls within classes.",
  "sinks": "Method calls accessing dictionary keys and returning attributes, which do not involve untrusted input or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No external or untrusted data flows detected; the code primarily defines static data structures and class behaviors.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual language features, or suspicious code patterns observed. The class and data structure definitions are straightforward and do not perform any system or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes to manage problem type information, with attributes indicating prediction capabilities and classification status. It uses predefined constants for problem types and initializes a static dictionary containing their attributes. All data appears static and hardcoded. No external inputs, network communications, or file operations are present. The code is structured to facilitate referencing problem types and their properties without any evident malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a static data model for machine learning problem types. It does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior, does not handle untrusted input, and presents no security risks. It is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
