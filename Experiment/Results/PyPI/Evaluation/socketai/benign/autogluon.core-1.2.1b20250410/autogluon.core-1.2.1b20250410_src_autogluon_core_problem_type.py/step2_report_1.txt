  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the code, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the actual content.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code defines classes (`ProblemType`, `ProblemTypeInfo`) and a static dictionary (`problem_type_info`) with predefined problem types and their capabilities.\n- No external inputs, network operations, or dynamic behaviors are present.\n- All data is hardcoded and straightforward.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are evident.\n- The purpose appears to be configuration or metadata management for ML problem types.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n\n**Summary:**  \nConfirms the code is static, safe, and serves as a data model with no malicious intent.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate. The code is purely static data with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n\n**Summary:**  \nSimilar to Report 1; emphasizes the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrect. No malicious or risky behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n\n**Summary:**  \nAgain, confirms the code is benign, with no suspicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAccurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n\n**Summary:**  \nDescribes the code as standard data modeling, with no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n\n**Summary:**  \nNotes the code's straightforward structure, no external input, and no malicious patterns.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Security Risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:**  \nCorrect.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is static, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in the reports?**  \n  No. All reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n\n- **Any anomalies or assumptions?**  \n  No. The reports do not assume malicious intent where none exists.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n**Estimated risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, static data model for managing ML problem types, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is safe, straightforward, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate.",
