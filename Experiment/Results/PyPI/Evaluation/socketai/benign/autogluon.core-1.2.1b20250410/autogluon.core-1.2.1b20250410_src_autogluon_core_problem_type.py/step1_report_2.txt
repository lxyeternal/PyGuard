  "purpose": "Define and store information about different machine learning problem types and their capabilities.",
  "sources": "Import statements, constant values, and class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "Method calls accessing dictionary keys, class instantiations, and attribute assignments.",
  "flows": "Initialization of ProblemType objects, method calls to retrieve problem type info, and list comprehensions filtering classification types.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code appears straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes to represent problem types with attributes indicating prediction capabilities and classification status. It constructs a ProblemTypeInfo object with predefined problem types, such as BINARY, MULTICLASS, etc., using constants imported from a module. The methods provide access to properties of these problem types and list classification types. There are no external data inputs, network interactions, or dynamic code execution. All data structures are statically defined. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of data structures for categorizing machine learning problem types. It is straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious intent, and serves as a configuration or utility module.",
