  "purpose": "Define classes and data structures to represent and manage problem types for a machine learning framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing and relative import of constants; class initializations using imported constants.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or network operations detected.",
  "flows": "The code mainly constructs objects and stores predefined constants; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. All code appears straightforward and intended for data modeling.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard typing modules and project constants. Defines a simple class 'ProblemType' with attributes indicating model capabilities. Implements 'ProblemTypeInfo' class to manage multiple 'ProblemType' instances, allowing querying capabilities and classification status. Initializes a dictionary 'problem_type_dict' with predefined problem types (binary, multiclass, softclass, regression, quantile) using imported constants. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, no secret data handling, no suspicious network activity. The code's structure and logic are typical for configuration or data modeling in a machine learning context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of problem type configuration and management for a machine learning library. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
