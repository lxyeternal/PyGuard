  "purpose": "Defines classes and data structures for representing and querying problem types in a machine learning context.",
  "sources": "Constant imports from .constants; class definitions; initialization of problem_type_info with predefined ProblemType instances.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "ProblemTypeInfo methods accessing the problem_type_dict to retrieve problem type attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up data models for categorizing ML problem types, including attributes for prediction capabilities and classification status. No user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution are present. The class methods are straightforward and use static data. The import statements are simple and only reference local constants, with no indication of malicious behavior. The code is well-structured and appears to serve a documentation or configuration purpose without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration module for ML problem types, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
