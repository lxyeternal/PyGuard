{
  "purpose": "Define and manage information about different problem types for a machine learning framework, including their prediction capabilities and classification status.",
  "sources": "Constant imports from `.constants`, data passed into `ProblemTypeInfo` constructor (`problem_type_dict`), and method parameters such as `problem_type`.",
  "sinks": "Access to `self.problem_type_dict[problem_type]` in `_get_problem_type()` which retrieves data based on provided keys.",
  "flows": "Data flows from `problem_type` arguments through `_get_problem_type()` to retrieve properties like `can_predict`, `can_predict_proba`, and `is_classification`.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or malicious constructs detected. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class structure defining problem types with associated attributes for machine learning tasks. It imports constants, creates `ProblemType` instances, and stores them in a dictionary for easy retrieval. The methods provide access to properties of each problem type based on string keys. No external input is processed unsafely, no data leaks, code injections, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation for managing problem type metadata in a machine learning context. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
