  "purpose": "Importing modules and functions from the autogluon package and local project files, setting up logging.",
  "sources": "Import statements for autogluon.common.dataset, autogluon.common.utils.log_utils, local constants, metrics, and version modules.",
  "sinks": "No clear sink present; no data output or untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks; code primarily initializes modules and configures logging.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a private or internal function _add_stream_handler, which may be intended for internal use only; no malicious behavior but slightly unconventional for public APIs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules, including a dataset module, a logging utility, and local project modules/constants. It then calls _add_stream_handler() to configure logging. The function name starts with an underscore, suggesting internal use, but there's no evidence of malicious intent. No untrusted data handling or data leakage observed. The code is straightforward and typical for setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard setup tasks: importing modules and configuring logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious data flow, or security risks. The only noteworthy point is the use of an internal function, which is not inherently suspicious but may indicate reliance on internal implementation details.",
