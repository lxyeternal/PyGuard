  "purpose": "Setup dependencies and logging configuration for the autogluon library in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Imports from autogluon.common.dataset, autogluon.common.utils.log_utils, and local modules/constants; call to _add_stream_handler()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, user input, or external outputs; no data leaks or sensitive operations",
  "flows": "Import statements and function call are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of internal function _add_stream_handler() with leading underscore; no obfuscation or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports and a call to an internal logging setup function. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted data is present. The internal function _add_stream_handler() is unconventional but not malicious. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and risk score is very low (~0.0-0.1) due to reliance on internal API, but no actual security threat exists.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard setup code with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of an internal function does not pose a security concern, and the overall assessment is that this is a safe, non-malicious snippet.",
