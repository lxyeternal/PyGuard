{
  "purpose": "The code provides resource calculation utilities for distributed machine learning training, managing CPU and GPU allocations, and integrating with Ray for parallel execution.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as total resources, user-specified resource requests, and system resource info via ResourceManager.",
  "sinks": "Internal data flow; no external data transmission or sinks; resource info is used internally for scheduling.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (total resources, user requests) flow into calculation functions, resulting in resource allocation dicts used internally for job scheduling.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Usage of standard libraries and resource management tools is typical.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard resource management calculations for distributed training, validating user inputs with assertions, querying system resources via ResourceManager, and integrating with Ray for placement groups. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The resource calculation logic is straightforward and purpose-driven, with validation to prevent overcommitment. External dependencies are standard for distributed ML workflows. No external data leaks or malicious data flows are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured resource management utility for distributed machine learning training. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or obfuscation. The minimal security risk stems from reliance on user inputs, which are validated. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the code's purpose and validation measures.",
