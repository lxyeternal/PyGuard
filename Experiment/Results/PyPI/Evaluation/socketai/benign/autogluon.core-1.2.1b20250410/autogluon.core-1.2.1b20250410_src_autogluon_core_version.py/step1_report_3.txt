  "purpose": "Define version information and a mode flag for the AutoGluon package.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present as the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; the code simply assigns version variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a version string with a 'b' indicating a beta or pre-release version, but this is a common practice and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, setting version and mode flags. No external inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The version string may indicate a pre-release, but this is standard for versioning practices. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious or security concerns. It does not contain any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
