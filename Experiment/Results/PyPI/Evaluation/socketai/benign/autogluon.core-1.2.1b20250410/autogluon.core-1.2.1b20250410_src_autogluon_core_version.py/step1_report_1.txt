  "purpose": "Declare version information for the autogluon package.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded version strings assigned to __version__ and __lite__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No data flows present, as the code only assigns static strings and boolean values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code consists of simple variable assignments with no complex logic or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining static version and mode variables for the package. No external input is processed, and there are no suspicious or malicious constructs. The version string appears to be a standard package version with a specific date suffix. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or risky behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a version identifier for the package. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
