  "purpose": "This code defines version metadata for the package, serving as a static identifier with no operational logic.",
  "sources": "N/A (no input or data reading; static variable assignments only)",
  "sinks": "N/A (no data flow or untrusted data handling)",
  "flows": "N/A (no source-to-sink data flow; static assignments only)",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward with no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for version information, with no functions, input/output, external dependencies, or dynamic execution. The version string includes a 'b' and a date suffix, indicating a pre-release or beta version, which is standard and not suspicious. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and clarity confirm its benign nature. All reports correctly assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence, consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores and assessments across all reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or further scrutiny are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
