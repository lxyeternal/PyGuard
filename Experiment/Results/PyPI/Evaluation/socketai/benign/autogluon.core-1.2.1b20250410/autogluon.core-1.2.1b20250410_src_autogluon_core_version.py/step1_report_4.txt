{
  "purpose": "Defines version information for the autogluon package",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings to variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points",
  "flows": "None, as it's only variable assignments",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a version string with a 'b' indicating a beta or pre-release version, which is not unusual but worth noting",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two variable assignments: __version__ and __lite__. The version string includes a 'b' which typically indicates a beta or pre-release version, but this is standard practice in versioning schemes. There are no input/output operations, no external data reads, and no suspicious code. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious behavior or security issues. It merely sets version identifiers for the package.",
