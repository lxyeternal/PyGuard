  "purpose": "Define version information for the autogluon package",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings to variables (__version__, __lite__)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data handling present",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a version string with a date embedded (__version__ = \"1.2.1b20250410\"), which might indicate a build date or timestamp, but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns static strings to module-level variables representing the package version and a lite mode flag. The version string includes a 'b' and a date-like suffix, which is typical for pre-release or build versions. No input, data processing, or network activity is present. The code does not contain obfuscated or suspicious constructs. It is a standard version declaration file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of a timestamp in the version string does not indicate malicious intent.",
