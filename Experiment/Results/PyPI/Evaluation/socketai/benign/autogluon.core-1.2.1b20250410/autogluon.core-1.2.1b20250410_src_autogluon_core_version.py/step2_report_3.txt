  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a simple, static assignment of version strings and flags.\n- No external input, data flows, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The version string includes a 'b' and a date suffix, which is typical for pre-release or build versions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or security risks are evident.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Code presence and correctness:**\n   - The code matches the description: it assigns static strings to `__version__` and `__lite__`.\n   - No issues with code correctness or presence of malicious code.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes:**\n   - No logical errors or mistakes are identified.\n   - The presence of a date suffix in the version string is standard and not suspicious.\n\n3. **Scores review:**\n   - All reports assign malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Risk scores justification:**\n   - Since the code is purely declarative with no malicious or risky behavior, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n   - The presence of a version string with a date suffix does not increase risk.\n\n5. **Malware score:**\n   - Correctly set to 0; no malicious activity detected.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities:**\n   - All claims are reasonable, based on static assignment, with no assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Consistency:**\n   - The scores and conclusions are consistent across all reports.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is a benign, standard version declaration file.\n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n- No modifications needed.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The version string's format is typical and does not indicate any nefarious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll evidence points to this being a straightforward, harmless version file. No further action or concern is warranted.",
