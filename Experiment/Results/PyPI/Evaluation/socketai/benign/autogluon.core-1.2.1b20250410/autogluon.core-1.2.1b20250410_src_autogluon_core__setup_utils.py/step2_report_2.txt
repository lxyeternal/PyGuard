  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a typical setup utility script for a Python package, managing dependencies, versioning, and package configuration.\n- All reports agree that the code reads environment variables, files, and writes files—standard in build scripts.\n- No suspicious or malicious behaviors (e.g., network activity, code injection, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets) are detected.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of individual reports:**\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Malware score: 0**\n- **Security risk: 0**\n- **Confidence: 1**\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected; standard setup script.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Malware score: 0**\n- **Security risk: 0**\n- **Confidence: 0.9**\n- **Conclusion:** Same as above; standard, safe setup utility.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Malware score: 0**\n- **Security risk: 0**\n- **Confidence: 0.95**\n- **Conclusion:** Also consistent with a benign setup script.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Malware score: 0**\n- **Security risk: 0**\n- **Confidence: 1**\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; typical setup code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Malware score: 0**\n- **Security risk: 0**\n- **Confidence: 1**\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; standard setup.\n\n---\n\n### **Assessment of scores:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis. No suspicious or malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate given the absence of security concerns.\n\n**Are any scores unreasonable?**  \nNo. The scores are consistent with the code and analysis. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential issues or concerns:**\n\n- The only minor point is the use of `open()` without explicit validation, but this is standard in setup scripts and not inherently risky.\n- Dependency version ranges are well-defined and do not suggest malicious intent.\n- Environment variables are used for configuration, which is typical.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendations:**\n\n- **Overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores:**  \n  **Malware:** 0  \n  **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  **Risk:** 0\n\n- These scores reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, transparent setup utility script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The existing scores are appropriate and should remain as-is.\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms the reports' conclusions and the code's safety profile.",
