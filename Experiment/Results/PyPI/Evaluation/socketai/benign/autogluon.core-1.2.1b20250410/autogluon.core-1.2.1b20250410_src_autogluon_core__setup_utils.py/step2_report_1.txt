  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup utility with no suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is straightforward, involving dependency management, versioning, and packaging. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The reasoning is sound, and the confidence is high.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, confirms standard setup behavior with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code appears standard. The slightly lower confidence reflects some caution but no actual suspicion. The reasoning is consistent, and no issues are identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion — standard setup code, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.95\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis is consistent with previous reports. The code is straightforward, with no hidden behaviors.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard setup utility, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound, and the code is typical for package setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion — no malicious activity, standard dependency and version management.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code is a standard setup utility script for a Python package. It reads environment variables, manages dependencies, handles versioning, and writes version files.  \n- **Malware & obfuscation:** No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors.  \n- **Security risks:** No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection detected.  \n- **Scores consistency:** All reports assign zero to malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — standard build script with no security concerns.\n\n**Additional notes:**  \n- The use of environment variables and file I/O is typical for build scripts.  \n- Dependency ranges are carefully managed with upper and lower bounds.  \n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or secret handling present.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.  \n- Maintain high confidence levels.",
