  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, considering the code, logic, and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the script's role in setup, dependency management, and versioning.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate description of standard setup tasks, dependency management, and versioning.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is typical for a setup script, with no malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies dependency management, environment variables, and file operations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is standard for build and setup scripts, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Properly describes version management, environment variables, and file I/O.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious patterns, no obfuscation, no network activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The script performs typical setup tasks securely.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the script's role in dependency and version management.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The code is a conventional setup utility.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is standard, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — no security risks or vulnerabilities identified.\n\n### Additional Remarks:\n\n- The code does not perform any network activity, dynamic code execution, or access sensitive data.\n- Dependency ranges are well-defined, and environment variables are used for configuration, which is standard.\n- Versioning logic is typical for release scripts.\n- No signs of code injection, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the provided reports and their scoring.** The code appears to be a safe, standard setup utility with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0",
