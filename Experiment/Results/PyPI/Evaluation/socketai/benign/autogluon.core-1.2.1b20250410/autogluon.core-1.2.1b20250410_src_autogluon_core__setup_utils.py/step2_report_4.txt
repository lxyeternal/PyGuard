  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical flaws, score appropriateness, and consistency with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard setup utility with no suspicious or malicious behavior. It manages dependencies, versioning, and packaging tasks. No obfuscation or malware detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns well with the code. The code performs straightforward file I/O, environment variable checks, and dependency management. No signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard dependency and version management. No suspicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The detailed analysis confirms no malicious intent. The code's operations are typical for setup scripts.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, the script handles setup, dependencies, and versioning with no suspicious activity. It reads environment variables and files, writes version info, and manages dependencies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks are evident.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues. Reads environment variables, manages version files, and dependencies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** The logic and operations are typical for such scripts.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Also confirms no suspicious or malicious activity, standard dependency and version management.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code; no red flags.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Code Presence & Behavior:** The code is purely a setup utility, handling dependency version ranges, reading/writing version files, and managing release flags via environment variables.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns.\n- **Logical Flaws:** No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident. The code's flow is straightforward and standard.\n- **Scores Justification:** All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, which is consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured setup utility script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The reported scores are reasonable and justified.",
