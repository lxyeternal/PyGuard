  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without the actual code, this is a placeholder.",
  "sources": "The code potentially reads data from input functions, environment variables, or file reads, but specific sources are not visible without the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network calls, file writes, or system commands if present, but none are explicitly identified without the code.",
  "flows": "Flow analysis cannot be completed without concrete code; typically, it involves data flowing from sources to sinks via variables and functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be detected without seeing the code. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are identifiable.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information to perform a detailed analysis. Cannot determine data sources, sinks, or suspicious patterns without code content.",
