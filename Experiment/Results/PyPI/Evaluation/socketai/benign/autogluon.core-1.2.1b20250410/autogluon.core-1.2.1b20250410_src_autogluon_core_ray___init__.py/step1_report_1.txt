{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a standard Python module, possibly for utility functions or package initialization.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, imported modules, and potentially from user input or external files if present.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could reach functions that perform network requests, file operations, or execute code, but no explicit such sinks are present in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input sources through various functions, but no risky flows to external systems or sensitive sinks are clearly observable in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code appears straightforward without obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code performs basic setup and utility tasks typical for a Python package or module. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or system modifications are evident. Usage of environment variables and imports is standard. The absence of dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs further reduces suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this code fragment, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to serve standard purposes, and no malicious patterns are detected.",
