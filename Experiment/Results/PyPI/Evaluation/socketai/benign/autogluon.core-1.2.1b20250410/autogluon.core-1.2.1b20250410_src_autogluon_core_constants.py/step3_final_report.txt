{
  "purpose": "Defines constants, problem types, suffixes, argument keys, thresholds, and documentation comments for an AutoGluon-based machine learning framework configuration.",
  "sources": "Static constant definitions, list assignments, and descriptive comments within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process external input or data, nor does it perform any data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is purely declarative with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward, static, and serves as configuration documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constants, list variables, and comments. No functions, dynamic code, or external data handling are present. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The purpose is to serve as configuration and documentation for an AutoGluon framework. Given this, there are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration snippet with no malicious intent or security concerns. All reports correctly identify this, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
