  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the key aspects:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is static, consisting solely of constant definitions, lists, and documentation comments. There are no functions, input parsing, or dynamic execution, which aligns with the original code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. They emphasize the static and declarative nature of the code, which is accurate.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**  \n   All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. The confidence levels are 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are zero, which is justified. The code is purely configuration, with no dynamic or executable components.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, consistent with the analysis that there's no malicious intent.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as static configuration without external dependencies or malicious logic.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report Content:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the content—no malware, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- The code is a straightforward static configuration and documentation snippet for an AutoGluon-based framework.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis and scoring.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\nGiven the uniformity and correctness of the reports, I concur with their assessments. The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at **0**. The confidence level should stay at **1**, reflecting high certainty.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current evaluations and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, static configuration with no security concerns. All reports correctly identify this, and no changes are necessary.",
