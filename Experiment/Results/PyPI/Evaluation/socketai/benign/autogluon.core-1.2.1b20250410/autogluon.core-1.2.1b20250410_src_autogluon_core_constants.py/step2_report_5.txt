  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report to verify the claims and ensure consistency with the code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code is a static configuration and documentation snippet defining constants, problem types, suffixes, argument keys, thresholds, and descriptive comments for an AutoGluon-based ML framework.\n- No functions, input parsing, data processing, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Checks:\n\n**1. Are the reported issues present?**  \n- All reports agree that the code is benign, static, and purely declarative.  \n- No external data, no dynamic execution, no input handling, no network operations.  \n- The constants and comments serve documentation and configuration purposes only.\n\n**2. Errors, flaws, or mistakes in logic?**  \n- None detected. The code's purpose is clear, and no logical errors are evident.  \n- The comments and variable definitions are consistent and standard for configuration code.\n\n**3. Scores assigned to issues (malware, obfuscated, risk):**  \n- All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0, with confidence = 1.  \n- These are appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n**4. Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n- Not applicable; all scores are zero, indicating no risk.\n\n**5. Malware score considerations:**  \n- No malicious activity or code injection is present.  \n- The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n\n**6. Claims based on assumptions?**  \n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities; all assessments are consistent with the static, configuration nature of the code.\n\n**7. Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n- The reports' assessments are consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** **0** — No malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0** — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.  \n**Risk score:** **0** — No security risks identified.\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, static configuration snippet with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify this. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain at zero.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.",
