{
  "purpose": "Define constants, problem types, and configuration keys for an AutoGluon-based machine learning framework.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all data is predefined in constants and comments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations; no data leaks or command executions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted inputs; the code only defines static constants and documentation comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code behavior, or obfuscated constructs detected. The code consists of straightforward constant definitions and descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares string constants, lists, and documentation comments related to model configuration for AutoGluon. There are no functions, input parsing, or dynamic execution. The constants are used for internal configuration and are not user input or external data. The comments provide documentation and are standard for configuration code. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All code appears benign and solely for configuration and documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static configuration and documentation snippet with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply defines constants and descriptive comments related to AutoGluon model parameters. There is no indication of malware, supply chain attack, or security concern within this fragment.",
