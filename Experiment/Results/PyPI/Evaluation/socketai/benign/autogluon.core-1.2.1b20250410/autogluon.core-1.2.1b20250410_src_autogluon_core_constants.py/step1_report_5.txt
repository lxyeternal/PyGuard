{
  "purpose": "Define constants, problem types, and configuration keys for an AutoGluon-based machine learning framework.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, list initializations, string assignments, and comments providing documentation within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points involving untrusted input or output; no execution of external commands or handling of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code mainly consists of static definitions and comments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns observed. The code is purely declarative and documentation-oriented.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only constant definitions, configuration string literals, and descriptive comments related to a machine learning library. No dynamic code execution, external input handling, or network operations are present. There are no indications of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. The structure and content are typical of configuration or constants files, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign configuration and documentation segment defining constants and parameters for a machine learning framework. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears safe and intended solely for configuration purposes.",
