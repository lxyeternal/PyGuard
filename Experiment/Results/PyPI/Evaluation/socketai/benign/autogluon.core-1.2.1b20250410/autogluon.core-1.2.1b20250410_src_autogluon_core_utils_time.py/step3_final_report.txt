  "purpose": "Utility functions for timing function execution and sampling pandas DataFrames for benchmarking purposes.",
  "sources": "Input DataFrame in sample_df_for_time_func; function f and its arguments in time_func.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network, or file I/O involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from DataFrame and function arguments into sampling and timing functions; no external or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides two utility functions: 'time_func' measures average execution time with optional repeats and time limits; 'sample_df_for_time_func' samples DataFrame rows with validation to prevent excessive memory use. Both functions perform input validation, use standard libraries, and contain no malicious or suspicious code. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation detected. The sampling and timing logic are typical and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, utility-oriented, and free of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. No modifications to the scores are necessary; the code is safe for use.",
