  "purpose": "This script dynamically loads version information and dependencies for a Python package, then sets up the package installation configuration.",
  "sources": "Importing '_setup_utils.py' from an external path, calling functions from this module to load version info, get dependencies, and create setup arguments.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'setup()' with dependency lists and setup arguments; no untrusted data is directly used in sensitive functions.",
  "flows": "External file import -> loading version and dependency data -> passing dependency data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import from a relative path to avoid direct dependency on autogluon.core; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; no code injections detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads utility functions from an external file using importlib.util, then retrieves version info and dependency ranges dynamically. It constructs dependency lists based on mode flags, and defines extras for optional features. It finally calls 'setup()' with the assembled parameters. No indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The use of dynamic imports could be a technique to avoid direct dependency checks but does not inherently imply malicious intent. All operations appear to be standard for package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with dynamic version and dependency management. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. It appears legitimate and typical for Python package configuration.",
