  "purpose": "Load version information and dependencies dynamically, then execute package setup.",
  "sources": "Reading version via ag.load_version_file(), importing '_setup_utils.py' via importlib.util.spec_from_file_location.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "External file '_setup_utils.py' is imported, providing version and utility functions used in subsequent setup steps.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import of external utility module ('_setup_utils.py'); comment indicating 'HACK' suggests awareness of non-standard pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a dynamic import to load version and utility functions from an external script, which is common in complex build processes to avoid code duplication. No malicious code, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The main concern is trust in the external file, but within controlled environments, this pattern is acceptable. The dependency lists and setup invocation are standard. No suspicious data flows or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate package setup script utilizing dynamic import for version management. No malware or malicious intent is evident. The primary risk relates to trusting the external utility file, but this is typical in build systems. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
