  "purpose": "This script configures the setup process for a Python package, dynamically importing utility functions and specifying dependencies and extras for installation.",
  "sources": "Importing external module '_setup_utils.py' from a relative path; reading version data through ag.load_version_file(); obtaining dependencies via ag.get_dependency_version_ranges(); potentially executing setup() with dynamically generated arguments.",
  "sinks": "Execution of ag.create_version_file() and setup() which could execute dynamically generated code or write files; dynamic imports and execution of modules at runtime.",
  "flows": "Import of '_setup_utils.py' -> loading version info via ag.load_version_file() -> updating version with ag.update_version() -> generating dependency list -> calling ag.create_version_file() -> executing setup() with generated arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a hacky import method to load utility code from a relative path; dynamic module import without validation; potential reliance on external code for version management and setup logic; no hardcoded credentials or secrets found; no obfuscated code patterns or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script performs dynamic import of a utility module located outside the standard package structure, which is somewhat unconventional but not inherently malicious. It fetches version info and dependencies via utility functions and then executes the setup process with these parameters. All operations seem related to package configuration. No code injections, network connections, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of runtime module import and version generation is typical for complex build scripts but warrants cautious review to ensure the imported module is trustworthy. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard package setup script with dynamic imports and dependency management. No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are evident based on the provided code. The unconventional import method is noted but not suspicious. Overall, the script is safe within the scope of package configuration.",
