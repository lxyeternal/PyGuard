  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The script loads version info and dependencies dynamically, with no suspicious code or data leaks. Use of dynamic import is a technique to avoid dependency issues, not malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — minimal, due to dynamic import from external path, but within expected package setup context.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious activity is evident. The dynamic import could be a vector if the external file is compromised, but in controlled build environments, this is common.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the external utility module. No network or data leaks. The dynamic import is standard but could be risky if the external file is malicious.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malware.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — very low.\n- **Comments:** The analysis correctly notes the potential risk of executing external code but considers it typical for build scripts.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Focuses on the external '_setup_utils.py' import, noting the potential risk of executing external code without sanitization. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — slightly higher due to external code execution, but still within normal package build practices.\n- **Comments:** The reasoning is consistent; the external code's trustworthiness is assumed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Recognizes the dynamic import as a \"HACK\" but justifies it as necessary to avoid duplication. No malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.\n- **Comments:** Well reasoned; the use of importlib.util is standard in complex setup scripts.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to others, with focus on dynamic import and dependency management. No suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — due to dynamic import, but within expected practices.\n- **Comments:** The analysis is consistent; no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — the code is straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the reliance on dynamic import from an external file, a slight concern exists, but it's typical in build scripts and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- The code is a standard package setup script, using dynamic imports to load version and dependency info from an external utility module.\n- No evidence of malware, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- The dynamic import could be a vector if the external utility file is compromised, but assuming the build environment is controlled, this is a common pattern.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (due to dynamic external code loading, but acceptable in context)\n- **Overall risk:** Low, standard for complex setup scripts.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears legitimate, with no signs of supply chain attack or malware. The use of dynamic import is typical but warrants trust in the external utility module.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure external utility files are securely maintained and verified, especially when used in build scripts.",
