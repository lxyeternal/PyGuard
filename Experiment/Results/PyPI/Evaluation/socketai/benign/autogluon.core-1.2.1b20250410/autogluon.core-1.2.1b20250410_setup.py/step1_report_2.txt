  "purpose": "This script sets up and configures dependencies for the autogluon package, including version management and optional extras.",
  "sources": "Reads the current file path, imports a utility module from a relative path, loads version info via a dynamically imported module, and gathers dependency lists.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or executes untrusted data. No network communication, file writing, or command execution from untrusted sources is present.",
  "flows": "Imports utility module -> loads version info -> determines dependencies based on mode -> creates version file -> runs setup with dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "The code dynamically imports a local utility module to access version information, which could be misused if the module is malicious, but this is part of standard setup procedures. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically loads a utility module to obtain version information and dependency details, then constructs setup parameters for package installation. No external data input is processed, and the setup process is straightforward. The use of importlib for local module import is common in setup scripts. No network or system commands are executed with untrusted data. The dependencies are explicitly listed with version constraints. The code structure and logic are typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with dynamic version management and conditional dependency inclusion. No malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks are detected. It appears to be a legitimate build script with no signs of supply chain sabotage or malware.",
