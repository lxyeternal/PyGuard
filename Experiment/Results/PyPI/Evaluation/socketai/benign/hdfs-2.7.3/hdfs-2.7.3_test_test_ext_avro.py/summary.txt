  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard test suite for HDFS Avro functionalities with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are consistent with its behavior, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) justified by external interactions that are typical in testing environments."
