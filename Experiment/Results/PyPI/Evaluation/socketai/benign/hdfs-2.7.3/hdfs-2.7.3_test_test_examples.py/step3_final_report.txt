  "purpose": "The code dynamically generates tests for each Python script in the 'examples' directory, loading and executing them via _load_source to verify their correctness.",
  "sources": "Filesystem directory listing of 'examples'; each source file is loaded and executed through _load_source.",
  "sinks": "Execution of external source files; potential for malicious code if files are compromised, but intended for controlled testing.",
  "flows": "Filesystem list -> make_test() -> _load_source() -> execution of source code.",
  "anomalies": "Standard dynamic test generation; no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; relies on controlled environment.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a metaclass to create test functions for each Python file in the 'examples' directory, executing each via _load_source. This pattern is typical for testing code snippets. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or network activity are evident. The main risk is executing external code, which could be dangerous if the directory contains malicious files, but in a controlled environment with trusted scripts, this is acceptable. The code also temporarily overrides Config.get_client, which does not introduce security issues in this context. Overall, the code is straightforward, with low security risk, assuming the source files are trusted.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test harness that loads and executes local example scripts. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The primary concern is the potential risk of executing untrusted code, but in a controlled testing environment, this is acceptable. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk.",
