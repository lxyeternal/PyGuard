  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test harness that loads and executes local example scripts. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The primary concern is the potential risk of executing untrusted code, but in a controlled testing environment, this is acceptable. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minimal inherent risk."
