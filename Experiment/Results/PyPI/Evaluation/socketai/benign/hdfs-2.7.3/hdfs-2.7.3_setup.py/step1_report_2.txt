  "purpose": "Setup script for the hdfs package, configuring installation, dependencies, and CLI entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version from hdfs/__init__.py and README.md; reads environment variable HDFSCLI_ENTRY_POINT; loads package data and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; environment variable influences CLI entry point naming but is used safely.",
  "flows": "Environment variable HDFSCLI_ENTRY_POINT influences the format of CLI command names during setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable to determine CLI command names could be manipulated but is generally controlled; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures, extracting version info from a local file and reading a README for description. It dynamically sets CLI entry point names based on an environment variable, which is a controlled behavior. No external data is processed in a way that poses security risks. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code is typical for Python package setup scripts, with no signs of malicious payloads or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for the hdfs package with no malicious intent or security risks. It responsibly manages dependencies and CLI configuration, with minimal exposure to manipulation through environment variables.",
