{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the hdfs package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads package files ('hdfs/__init__.py', 'README.md') and environment variables ('HDFSCLI_ENTRY_POINT').",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variable to determine CLI alias; no other sinks involving untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'HDFSCLI_ENTRY_POINT' influences the format string for CLI entry points; reads package files for version and description.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. The environment variable default value appears safe. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The script loads version info from a package file and long description from README. It utilizes environment variables for configuration, which is standard practice. Dependencies are specified explicitly. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity is present. No signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation. The code structure and functions are straightforward, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to common package configuration practices without including any suspicious or malicious behavior.",
