  "purpose": "Integration tests for reading and writing pandas DataFrames to HDFS using Avro format, verifying data integrity and column order.",
  "sources": "Local JSONL file ('weather.jsonl') for test data; HDFS client for upload/download operations.",
  "sinks": "HDFS storage where data is written and read back during tests.",
  "flows": "Load JSONL data -> upload to HDFS -> read via read_dataframe -> verify with original DataFrame; write DataFrame to HDFS -> read back with read_dataframe -> verify data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard integration testing for pandas DataFrame serialization over HDFS using Avro. It loads test data from a local file, uploads it to HDFS, reads it back, and verifies data integrity and column order. No obfuscated code, malicious behaviors, or security vulnerabilities are present. External dependencies are standard, and data flows are straightforward. The code's purpose is solely testing, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing data serialization and transfer with no malicious or security concerns. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to external system interactions, but no vulnerabilities are evident. Malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The overall security risk score can be considered very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the controlled testing environment.",
