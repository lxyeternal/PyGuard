  "purpose": "Defines CLI commands for managing orphaned content in Pulp, delegating cleanup operations to context objects.",
  "sources": "User input parameters via click options, plugin requirement checks, context objects for operation delegation.",
  "sinks": "Delegated functions such as orphan_ctx.cleanup() and pulp_ctx.output_result(), which are external and not detailed here.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed into cleanup functions, which invoke context methods to perform actions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Use of 'assert' for type checking is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI setup using click decorators, passing parameters to context methods. No malicious, obfuscated, or insecure code is present. Delegation to external context methods means core logic is elsewhere, but nothing suspicious is indicated. No network activity or data exfiltration is evident. Plugin version checks are standard dependency controls. Overall, the code appears benign and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI interface for orphaned content cleanup, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
