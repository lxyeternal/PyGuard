  "purpose": "Defines CLI commands for managing 'worker' entities within a Pulp system, including listing and showing details.",
  "sources": "Command-line options for filtering and display; imported functions and modules (click, pulp_glue, pulp_cli).",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "CLI options are passed to command functions; no data flows to external systems or insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI setup using click decorators and external modules for command grouping and options. It handles user input for filtering and displaying worker info without processing untrusted data insecurely. No network activity, file operations, or code injection present. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe CLI command setup for managing worker entities, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
