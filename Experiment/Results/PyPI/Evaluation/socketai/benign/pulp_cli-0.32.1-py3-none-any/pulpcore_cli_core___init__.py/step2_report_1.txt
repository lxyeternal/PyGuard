  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the presence of any malicious activity, and appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code sets up CLI commands, with a minor alias correction (handling 'domains' -> 'domain') and no malicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The warning message is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (very low, given the benign nature).\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. The only noteworthy aspect is the command alias warning, which is harmless.\n- **Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing command registration and alias correction with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Findings:** No external network activity, no secrets, no malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The minor alias correction is a usability feature, not malicious.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above—CLI setup with a benign alias correction.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (still very low).\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion is consistent with the code.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar CLI registration with a benign alias correction.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is correct.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others—standard CLI registration with minor alias handling.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion is accurate.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. **Set to 0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. **Set to 0**.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, as the only notable behavior is a benign command alias warning. **Set to 0** or very close to it (e.g., 0.1) for conservative assessment.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (to account for the minor command alias warning, which is benign but slightly user-impacting)\n\nThis code is a standard CLI setup with a harmless user notification feature. No malicious or security-compromising behavior is present.",
