  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and applying critical reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is a CLI command that retrieves status, with retries and cache refresh. No suspicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation. The logic is straightforward.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence, given the thoroughness.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion is accurate. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard retry and cache refresh logic. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — slightly above zero, but justified given the network calls and cache refresh; still low.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No signs of malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard status retrieval with retries and cache refresh, no anomalies or suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — matches the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — still low, reflecting typical network activity and cache management.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high, but slightly less than others, possibly due to conservative language.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, straightforward CLI status command with retries and cache refresh.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — aligns with normal operation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95 — high.\n\n**Assessment:** Well-reasoned, no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—standard CLI status command, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — consistent with typical network activity.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code is a straightforward CLI command that performs status checks, retries, and cache refreshes. No suspicious or malicious code is present.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or obfuscated behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; all reports agree on this.\n- **Risk scores:** The risk scores are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting standard network and cache operations, which are typical in such CLI tools.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — confirmed safe.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Given the operations involve network calls, retries, and cache refresh, a slightly higher risk score (around 0.1–0.2) is justified, but not exceeding that.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — minor risk due to network activity and cache management, but standard for such tools.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is legitimate, safe, and free of malware or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.",
