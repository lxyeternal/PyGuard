  "purpose": "Retrieve pulp server status with retry logic and cache refresh if outdated.",
  "sources": "Input options for retries and retry delay; API call 'status_read'; cache refresh via 'load_api'.",
  "sinks": "Outputting status result; error messages on failure; cache refresh trigger.",
  "flows": "Input options -> Retry logic -> API call 'status_read' -> Cache validation -> Potential cache refresh -> Output result.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual control flow detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI command that performs status retrieval with retry and cache refresh logic. It handles exceptions properly, avoids hardcoded secrets, and does not contain obfuscation or malicious patterns. The API interactions are standard for such tools, and no suspicious behaviors are evident. The retry mechanism and cache validation are implemented correctly, with appropriate error handling and user feedback. No anomalies or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for retrieving server status with retry and cache refresh logic. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are justified and appropriate.",
