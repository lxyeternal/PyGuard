  "purpose": "CLI management of Pulp task groups, handling UUIDs, waiting for tasks, and outputting status.",
  "sources": "User input via command-line options, context objects for task and entity data, URL construction for task references.",
  "sinks": "URL formation using UUIDs, outputting task statuses and waiting messages.",
  "flows": "Input options -> URL construction and context updates -> output messages and task waiting -> final output of task group entity.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert' for context validation; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI implementation for managing task groups, with standard libraries and patterns. It reads user input (UUID, wait flag), updates context objects, constructs URLs, and outputs status messages. No external network calls beyond URL formation are present. The use of 'assert' is benign but could be replaced with explicit error handling. No malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scoring of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 aligns with the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe CLI component for task management with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
