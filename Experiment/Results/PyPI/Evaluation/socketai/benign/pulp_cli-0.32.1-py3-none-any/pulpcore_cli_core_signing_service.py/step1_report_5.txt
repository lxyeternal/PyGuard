{
  "purpose": "Defines CLI commands related to signing services, including listing and showing details, using the click library and some custom context classes.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules and functions; function parameters; decorators and options defined for CLI commands.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks of untrusted data leading to data leaks or system effects; no external network communication, file I/O, or command execution present.",
  "flows": "Input options like '--name' are passed through decorators and commands, but there is no evidence of data flow leading to insecure operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments. The code primarily sets up CLI command structure without dynamic or unsafe code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code establishes CLI commands using click, sets up context handling with custom classes, and registers list and show commands with optional filtering. It imports modules related to internationalization and context management but does not perform any operations that could be malicious, such as network access, file manipulation, or code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward CLI setup for signing service management, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard implementation with no suspicious behaviors.",
