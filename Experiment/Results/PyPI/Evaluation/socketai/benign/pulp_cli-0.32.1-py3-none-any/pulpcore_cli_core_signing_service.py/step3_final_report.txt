  "purpose": "Defines CLI commands for managing signing services, including listing and showing signing service details.",
  "sources": "CLI options (--name, --href), imported modules (pulp_glue, pulp_cli), and context objects (PulpSigningServiceContext, PulpCLIContext).",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or data leaks are present; user input is handled via CLI options.",
  "flows": "CLI options flow into command functions; no untrusted data is transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward CLI setup with standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a CLI group with subcommands, using standard libraries and patterns. It accepts user input via CLI options, which are passed to context objects without further processing. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are evident. The imported modules are assumed trustworthy; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI setup for signing service management, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
