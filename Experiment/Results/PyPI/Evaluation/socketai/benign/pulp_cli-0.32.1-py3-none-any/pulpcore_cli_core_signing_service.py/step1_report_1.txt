  "purpose": "Define CLI commands for managing a signing service, including listing and showing details.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules (click, pulp_glue, pulp_cli), get_translation function, and command decorators.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling points are evident in this code.",
  "flows": "User inputs to CLI options (e.g., --name) are handled within click options; no external data flows or network communications are initiated here.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors. The code primarily sets up CLI commands with standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a CLI group 'signing_service' with subcommands for listing and showing signing services. It utilizes imported functions and classes for context management and command registration. There is no evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated parts, or secret handling. The use of standard libraries and straightforward structure indicates normal functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a typical CLI setup for managing signing services with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
