{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python library named 'parametrize' that provides a decorator for parameterized testing compatible with unittest and pytest.",
  "sources": "Reads package definitions, metadata, and configuration data from variables and imported modules (setuptools). No external input sources are used.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'setup' function from setuptools to process packaging data; no data is written or sent elsewhere during execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from static variable definitions to the 'setup' function call, which processes package configuration; no untrusted data flows or external input processing are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, such as code execution, network communication, or hidden payloads. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or hidden functions are present. The script performs a standard package setup with no malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Python package setup file that defines package metadata, dependencies, and configuration parameters, then calls 'setup' from setuptools to generate distribution files. All code is static and intended for packaging. There are no dynamic code evaluations, external data reads, or other suspicious behaviors. The script does not perform any actions beyond package configuration. No signs of malware, malicious code, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python testing utility library. It contains no malicious behavior, no obfuscated or suspicious code, and presents no security risks. The script's purpose is straightforward package configuration, with no signs of supply chain attacks or malware.",
