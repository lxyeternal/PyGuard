{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to copy Python code objects and function objects, mainly for compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reads include sys.version_info, function parameters, function attributes (__code__, __globals__, __closure__, __kwdefaults__, __dict__), and module imports (sys, inspect, types, typing).",
  "sinks": "Uses CodeType.replace (if available) or constructs new CodeType objects; creates new FunctionType objects and updates __kwdefaults__ and __dict__.",
  "flows": "The code reads system version info and function attributes, then creates copies by passing data into constructors, with no external untrusted input or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The code uses version checks for compatibility but does not invoke dynamic execution or eval.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally defines a function to copy code objects depending on Python version, avoiding deprecated attributes for older versions. It then defines a function to copy function objects, carefully copying defaults and attributes. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code operates purely on internal object copying, which is typical in metaprogramming or debugging utilities. No suspicious patterns or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility for copying code and function objects across Python versions. It does not contain malware or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal.",
