{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for copying Python code objects and function objects, supporting compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, inspect, types, and typing modules; uses sys.version_info to determine Python version; accesses function attributes such as __code__, __globals__, __kwdefaults__, __closure__, and __dict__.",
  "sinks": "Creates new code and function objects with modified attributes, particularly changing co_name in code objects and copying function defaults and attributes.",
  "flows": "Source: sys.version_info and function attributes → copy_code and copy_func create modified code/function objects → potentially used elsewhere in code for dynamic function creation or modification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Code performs standard, legitimate operations for code cloning and version compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages compatibility across Python versions for copying code objects and functions. It includes conditional logic to handle differences in code object attributes between Python 3.6/3.7 and later versions. The copy_code function creates a new code object with optional modifications; the copy_func function clones a function with a new name, defaults, and signature. All operations involve safe, standard library features without suspicious patterns. No obfuscated code, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The functionality appears intended for metaprogramming or dynamic function generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for copying code and function objects with support for different Python versions. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions, nor does it access or transmit sensitive data.",
