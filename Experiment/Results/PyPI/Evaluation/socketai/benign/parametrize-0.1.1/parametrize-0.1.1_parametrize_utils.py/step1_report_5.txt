{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for copying Python code objects and function objects, primarily for compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads system version info (sys.version_info), function code objects (__code__), function defaults (__defaults__, __kwdefaults__), and global variables (__globals__, __closure__).",
  "sinks": "The code constructs new function objects and code objects, which could potentially be used maliciously if combined with untrusted inputs, but in this context, it appears to be for safe copying.",
  "flows": "System info -> Function code and attribute reading -> Creating new code/func objects with updated attributes",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors observed. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious instructions. The code performs standard object copying and compatibility handling.",
  "analysis": "The code manages Python version compatibility for copying code objects and functions. It reads code object attributes and recreates them, which is a standard practice for dynamic function manipulation. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, remote communication, or malicious side-effects. The code's purpose appears to be utility for code object duplication, likely for metaprogramming, testing, or similar tasks. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a benign utility for copying code and function objects across Python versions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code snippet.",
