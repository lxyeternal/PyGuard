{
  "purpose": "The code provides utilities for copying Python code objects and function objects, primarily for internal use or metaprogramming purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from system version info (sys.version_info), code object attributes (CodeType), and function attributes (__code__, __globals__, __name__, __kwdefaults__, __closure__, __dict__).",
  "sinks": "The code writes or modifies function attributes (__code__, __name__, __kwdefaults__, __dict__), which could potentially influence function behavior if used maliciously, but these are internal API manipulations. No direct network, file, or external data sink is present.",
  "flows": "The code reads system info and code object attributes (source) and creates new code and function objects with altered attributes (sink). No external untrusted data source or sink is directly involved.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes compatibility handling for different Python versions, which is normal. The code manipulates internal code objects and function attributes, which could be misused if exposed externally, but the code itself appears to be standard utility functions for internal metaprogramming.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to copy code objects and functions, handling Python version differences to maintain compatibility. It manipulates code object attributes, copies function defaults, and preserves function state. There are no network operations, data leaks, or obfuscated/malicious behaviors. The purpose seems to be for internal code manipulation or metaprogramming, not for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for copying code and function objects, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles internal Python object manipulation in a standard way, with no external data exfiltration or harmful operations.",
