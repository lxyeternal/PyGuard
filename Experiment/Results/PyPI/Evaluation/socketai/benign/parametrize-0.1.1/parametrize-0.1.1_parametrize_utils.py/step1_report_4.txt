{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to copy Python code objects and function objects, adjusting attributes like name, defaults, and signature, likely for metaprogramming or dynamic code manipulation.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present; code reads attributes from existing code and function objects.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks, system modification, or other effects. The code creates copies of code and functions internally.",
  "flows": "Code object attributes are read to create a new code object, then used to create a new function object with potentially modified name and defaults.",
  "anomalies": "The code manipulates code objects and functions at a low level, which could be used maliciously to obfuscate or dynamically generate code, but no malicious behavior or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a compatibility layer for copying code objects for Python versions before 3.8, and provides a utility to create copies of functions with modified signatures and attributes. It does not include any network operations, file I/O, or external inputs. Its purpose appears to be metaprogramming or dynamic code generation. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are detected. The code operates solely within Python's introspective and dynamic capabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for copying and modifying code objects and functions, with no evident malicious intent. It is a legitimate metaprogramming utility and does not exhibit malicious or harmful behavior.",
