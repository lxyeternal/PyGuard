  "purpose": "Utility functions for copying Python code and function objects, supporting cross-version compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads system version info, function attributes (__code__, __globals__, __kwdefaults__, __closure__, __dict__).",
  "sinks": "Creates new code and function objects; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads attributes from existing code/function objects; constructs new objects with modified attributes.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward internal attribute manipulation, no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code provides safe, standard utilities for copying code and function objects, handling differences between Python versions. It does not perform any external I/O, network activity, or malicious operations. The manipulation of internal attributes is confined within the standard library API, used typically for metaprogramming or debugging. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: ~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe utility for internal code manipulation, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, and the code can be considered benign.",
