  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the described logic with the actual code, and evaluate the risk, malware, and obfuscation scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as a utility for copying code objects and functions, with compatibility handling for different Python versions.\n- The code manipulates internal Python objects (__code__, __globals__, __kwdefaults__, etc.) but does not perform external network, file, or system modifications.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are evident.\n- The code appears to be standard metaprogramming utility code, often used in debugging, testing, or dynamic code generation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n\n**1. Presence of malicious behavior?**\n\n- All reports agree that no malicious activity is present.\n- The code only manipulates internal objects and creates copies; no network, file, or external data access.\n\n**2. Is the code obfuscated?**\n\n- No obfuscation detected; code is straightforward and well-structured.\n\n**3. Are the scores reasonable?**\n\n- Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**4. Are the reasoning and conclusions consistent?**\n\n- Yes, all reports conclude the code is benign, utility in nature, and not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Version handling:** Correctly manages differences between Python 3.6/3.7 and later versions.\n- **Function copying:** Carefully copies defaults, kwdefaults, code object attributes, and function attributes.\n- **Potential misuse:** While manipulation of code objects can be misused if exposed externally, the code itself is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The reports' scores for malware (0) are justified.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low, given no external or malicious activity.\n- The confidence levels are high (~0.9-1), which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — Code is clear and straightforward.\n\n**Risk score:** 0.1 — Very low, primarily because the code manipulates internal objects, which could be misused if exposed, but as-is, it's safe.\n\n**Additional note:** If this code were part of a larger system, exposure of such functions to untrusted input could pose risks, but in isolation, the risk remains minimal.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard utility for copying code and function objects, supporting compatibility across Python versions.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (or possibly 0, but 0.1 is acceptable for very minimal risk)\n\nThis concludes the review.",
