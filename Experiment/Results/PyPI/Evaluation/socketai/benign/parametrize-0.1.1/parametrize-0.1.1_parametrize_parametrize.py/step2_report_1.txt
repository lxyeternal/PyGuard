  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as a parameterization utility for test functions.\n- They emphasize that the code uses standard Python features: inspect, partial, wraps, dynamic function creation, and namespace manipulation.\n- No mention of external system calls, network activity, file I/O, or obfuscation.\n- No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- The source code does source inspection, decorator handling, and dynamic function generation in a controlled manner.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence:** The code is indeed present and matches the described functionality.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected; no suspicious code, obfuscated segments, or external connections.\n- **Functionality:** It is a legitimate test parameterization utility.\n\n### Issues and logic:\n- The reports correctly identify the purpose, sources, sinks, and flows.\n- They highlight the use of dynamic function creation via `partial` and `wraps`, which is standard for test case generation.\n- They note that source code inspection is used to enforce decorator grouping and generate test functions, which is common in test frameworks.\n- The scores for malware (0) and obfuscated (0) are consistent with the code content.\n- The security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal risk.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports is justified. No malicious activity or code patterns are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as the code is transparent and uses standard patterns.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1-0.2), acknowledging that dynamic code manipulation can sometimes be misused, but in this context, it appears safe.\n\n### Any discrepancies or unreasonable scores?\n- The scores seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n- The high confidence levels (0.9-0.95) are justified.\n- No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports)  \n\n**Estimated overall security risk:** Very low. The code is a standard parameterization utility with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, consistent, and correctly assess the code as safe. The scores are reasonable and justified based on the code's functionality and behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No action needed. The code is safe, and the reports correctly reflect its nature.",
