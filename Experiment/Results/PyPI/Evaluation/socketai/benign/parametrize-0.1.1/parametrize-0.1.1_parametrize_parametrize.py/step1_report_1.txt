{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and utilities for parameterizing test functions, allowing dynamic creation of test cases with different input parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads function definitions, source code lines, and decorator usages; inspects function signatures, source lines, and module/global namespace.",
  "sinks": "Creates new functions dynamically via partial and wraps; sets attributes in local namespace; raises exceptions on misuse; no apparent data leakage or external connections.",
  "flows": "Source: function source code and decorator applications; Sink: dynamically generated test methods in namespace; flow occurs when parameters are added and test cases are generated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. Uses dynamic code constructs but in a typical test parameterization context. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code focuses on parameterizing test functions by adding multiple input sets, generating new test methods, and handling decorator logic. It inspects source code to count decorators, ensures argument names are unique, and dynamically creates test functions via partial application. No external network connections, system modifications, or hidden backdoors are present. All dynamic code execution appears related to legitimate test case generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for parameterized testing, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It leverages standard Python features for dynamic function creation and decorator handling. No security risks or malicious behavior identified.",
