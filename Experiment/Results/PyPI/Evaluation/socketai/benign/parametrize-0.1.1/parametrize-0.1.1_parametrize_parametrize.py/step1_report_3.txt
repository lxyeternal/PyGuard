{
  "purpose": "This code provides decorators and utility functions for parameterizing test functions, enabling dynamic generation of multiple test cases with different input parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads function definitions, source code lines, decorator usages, and local/global namespace variables.",
  "sinks": "Creates new functions via partial, wraps functions with decorators, and injects new function objects into local namespace.",
  "flows": "Source: Function source code and decorator annotations; Sink: Dynamically generated functions stored in namespace; Flow: Parsing decorators and applying partial functions to create test cases.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. Uses standard Python features, no obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution beyond common decorator and function wrapping patterns. No data exfiltration, network activity, or system modifications observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical implementation of a parameterization utility for test functions, leveraging standard Python introspection, decorators, and partial application. It inspects source lines to detect decorator ordering, modifies function names to create unique test cases, and dynamically injects functions into local namespace. The code does not perform any network communication, system modifications, or data theft. No obfuscation or malicious behaviors are present. The use of 'inspect', 'partial', and function wrapping is conventional for such utility code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured implementation of parameterized testing utilities without any malicious intent or harmful behavior. It operates within expected boundaries of test code generation, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
