  "purpose": "A utility for parameterizing test functions, allowing multiple input combinations to be injected into test cases via decorators, source inspection, and dynamic function creation.",
  "sources": "Function signatures, source lines of test functions, decorator definitions, and namespace dictionaries during decoration.",
  "sinks": "Injection of generated test functions into local namespace; creation of partial functions with specific parameters; source code inspection for decorator grouping.",
  "flows": "Decorator application reads source lines and decorator definitions, adds parameter sets to context, then creates and injects new functions into the namespace with unique names.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; standard use of dynamic function creation, source inspection, and namespace manipulation; no obfuscation or external system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard test parameterization pattern, inspecting source code to enforce decorator grouping, managing argument names to prevent conflicts, and dynamically generating test functions with unique names. It uses 'partial' and 'wraps' for function creation, and injects these into the local namespace. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or external connections are present. The use of source inspection and dynamic function creation is typical for test utilities and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard test parameterization utility with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate and the scores justified. Overall, the code is safe and benign.",
