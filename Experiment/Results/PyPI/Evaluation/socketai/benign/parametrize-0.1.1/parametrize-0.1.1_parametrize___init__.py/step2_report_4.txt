  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code in question is a simple Python module, likely an `__init__.py`, importing a local function `parametrize`, defining a version string, and specifying `__all__`.\n- All reports agree that there are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code performs standard module setup operations without any dynamic behavior, user input handling, network activity, or data processing.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code matches the original provided code exactly.\n- No issues are present in the code itself; all reports correctly identify its benign nature.\n\n**Errors or flaws in reports:**\n- No errors or logical flaws are evident in the reports. They are consistent and accurately describe the code.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- Security risk scores are 0, aligning with the lack of any suspicious or risky behavior.\n- Confidence scores are high (mostly 1), which is justified given the straightforward analysis.\n\n**Potential issues:**\n- No issues are identified with the scoring or reasoning.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code and analysis.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, benign module setup with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and their scoring reflects the true nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe and typical for a Python package's initialization.\n- All scores and reasoning are appropriate.\n- No further action needed.",
