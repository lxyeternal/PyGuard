  "purpose": "The code defines module metadata, including versioning and public API symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.parametrize).",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data flow.",
  "flows": "None, as there are no data flows or untrusted data sources.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol from a relative module, sets version information, and specifies public API exports. It does not contain any data handling, network operations, or logic that could be malicious. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present. The code appears straightforward and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a simple module initializer with no suspicious elements.",
