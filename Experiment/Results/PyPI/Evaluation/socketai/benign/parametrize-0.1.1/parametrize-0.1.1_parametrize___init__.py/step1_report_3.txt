{
  "purpose": "The code defines module metadata and exports a specific function, likely as part of a larger testing or parameterization framework.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (parametrize).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that process untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets the version, exports a list of functions, and imports a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious logic. The import is from a relative module, which is standard in package code. No external network or system interactions, nor any dynamic execution or obfuscated code, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign module setup with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
