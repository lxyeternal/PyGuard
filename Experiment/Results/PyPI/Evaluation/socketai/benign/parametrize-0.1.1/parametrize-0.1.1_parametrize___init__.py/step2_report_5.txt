  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple module initialization file, importing a local symbol, setting version info, and defining exports.\n- No untrusted data, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation is detected.\n- The code is static, minimal, and standard for a Python package's __init__.py or similar.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the code's content:\n\n**Original code:**\n```python\nfrom .parametrize import parametrize\n\n__version__ = \"0.1.1\"\n\n__all__ = [\n    \"parametrize\",\n]\n```\n\n- It imports `parametrize` from a local module `.parametrize`.\n- Sets `__version__`.\n- Defines `__all__` with `\"parametrize\"`.\n\n**No issues are present** in the code itself; it's a straightforward module setup.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### Report 1:\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as exporting 'parametrize' and defining version info.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.5 (or 0?). The report assigns 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n#### Report 2:\n- Same as above, with similar reasoning.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n#### Report 3:\n- Same reasoning, no suspicious activity.\n- Scores: all zero.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 4:\n- Same conclusion.\n- Scores: all zero.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Same reasoning.\n- Scores: all zero.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?** Yes, all reports assign zero malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Is there any overlooked malicious behavior?** No. The code is static, simple, and does not process untrusted data.\n- **Are the reports logical?** Yes, they are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 for all reports, as no malicious activity is present.\n\n**Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n\n**Risk score:** Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**However,** if I were to assign a **personal estimate** considering potential risks in supply chain contexts:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (since no dynamic or suspicious behavior)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value |\n|------------------|-------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 |\n| Security Risk    | 0                 |\n\n**All reports are accurate in their assessments.** The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are justified and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always keep in mind that in supply chain security, the context of the code's environment matters. But based solely on this static snippet, there's no concern.",
