  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module, version assignment, and __all__ declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; only static assignments and imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function from a local module, sets a version string, and defines exports. It is minimal and static, with no dynamic or insecure operations. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module setup with no malicious behavior or security concerns detected.",
