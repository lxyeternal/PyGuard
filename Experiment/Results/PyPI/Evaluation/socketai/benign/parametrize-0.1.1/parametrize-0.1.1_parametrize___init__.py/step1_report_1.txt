{
  "purpose": "The code exports a 'parametrize' function or object from a local module and defines version information for the package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module '.parametrize' for import.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code detected. The version string is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol from a local module, defines a version string, and specifies exportable symbols. It contains no user input handling, no network operations, and no dynamic code execution. The structure is standard for a Python module's __init__.py file. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module setup file with no malicious or suspicious content. It performs standard import and export operations with no apparent security concerns.",
