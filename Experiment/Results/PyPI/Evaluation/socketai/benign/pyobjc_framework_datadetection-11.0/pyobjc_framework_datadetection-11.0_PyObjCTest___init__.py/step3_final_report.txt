  "flows": "No data flows; the code is non-functional.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple comment with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment string 'tests' with no executable statements, input/output, or data handling. All reports confirm the absence of code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's trivial nature. Confidence is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a placeholder or test indicator, with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
