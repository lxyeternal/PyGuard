  "purpose": "Setup script for wrapping the macOS DataDetection framework using PyObjC, to facilitate Python bindings for the framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from os, sys, and pyobjc_setup; uses os.path.dirname(__file__) to modify sys.path; reads package and version information; reads module documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data handling; no network, file, or environment variable usage that could lead to data leaks or injection.",
  "flows": "Import statements and setup configuration flow directly; no untrusted data flows to sensitive functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is a standard package setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, importing modules, setting paths, and configuring the package metadata. It does not contain code execution, data handling, or external communication that could be malicious. The structure and content are typical for a Python package setup script, with no obfuscation, suspicious logic, or malicious intent apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script used for packaging and installing a PyObjC framework wrapper. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation in this code.",
