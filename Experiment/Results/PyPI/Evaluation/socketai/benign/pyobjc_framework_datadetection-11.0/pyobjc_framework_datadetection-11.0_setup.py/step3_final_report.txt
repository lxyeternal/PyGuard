  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'pyobjc-framework-DataDetection' on macOS, providing package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Standard modules 'os', 'sys', and local 'pyobjc_setup' for package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> modify sys.path -> call setup() with package info and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward package setup code with typical patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a PyObjC wrapper. It imports standard modules, adjusts sys.path, and calls setup() with package details. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling occurs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The manipulation of sys.path is common in setup scripts and does not pose security risks. Overall, the code is safe, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script for wrapping the DataDetection framework. It contains no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
