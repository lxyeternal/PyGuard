{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the Python package 'pyobjc-framework-DataDetection' as a wrapper for the macOS DataDetection framework using pyobjc.",
  "sources": "os, sys, and pyobjc_setup modules; the import statements and os.path.dirname(__file__) for path configuration",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flow, external network calls, or sensitive data handling present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only performs package setup operations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscated segments, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports necessary modules, adjusts sys.path, and calls setup() with package metadata and dependencies. It does not perform any network activity, file manipulation beyond setup, or data processing. The use of version strings and paths appears standard. There is no malicious intent or suspicious logic in the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate package configuration code for wrapping a macOS framework.",
