{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package that provides wrappers for the DataDetection framework on macOS, facilitating integration with Objective-C frameworks via PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'os', 'sys', and 'pyobjc_setup'; assignment of version string; setup() function call with package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted input could be involved if external code modifies 'sys.path' or supplies malicious package dependencies, but within this code, no direct sinks exist.",
  "flows": "The script adjusts 'sys.path' to include its directory, then executes 'setup()' with package info and dependencies; no data flows from external inputs to vulnerable points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The manipulation of 'sys.path' is standard in package setup scripts and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs package setup tasks, including adjusting 'sys.path' and calling 'setup()' with metadata and dependencies. The import of 'pyobjc_setup' and use of 'setup()' are typical for Python package distribution. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code does not handle untrusted input or perform network operations. The use of 'sys.path.insert' is common for package setup and does not pose security risks in this context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package providing macOS framework wrappers. It contains no malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is benign and purely for package configuration.",
