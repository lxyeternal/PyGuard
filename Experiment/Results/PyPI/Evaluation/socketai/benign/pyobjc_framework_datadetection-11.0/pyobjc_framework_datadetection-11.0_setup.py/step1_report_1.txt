{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup script for a Python package providing wrappers for the macOS DataDetection framework using PyObjC.",
  "sources": "Reads include standard library imports (os, sys), the script's own directory via os.path.dirname(__file__), and the __doc__ string for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data are present. The setup function is used to install packages and dependencies, which is typical for package configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks that could lead to security issues. The code primarily configures package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior detected. The code is a standard setup script with no hardcoded credentials or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, adjusts sys.path for module resolution, and calls setup from pyobjc_setup to define package metadata and dependencies. There are no suspicious functions, no dynamic code execution, and no network or data exfiltration activities. The purpose is to facilitate package installation. No anomalies, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign package setup script for macOS PyObjC wrappers. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
