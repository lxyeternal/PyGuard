  "purpose": "The code provides setup configuration for the 'pyobjc-framework-DataDetection' package, acting as a wrapper for macOS's DataDetection framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`os`, `sys`, `pyobjc_setup`) and the `__doc__` variable for long_description.",
  "sinks": "The setup function that installs dependencies and configures the package; no untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input sources are the import statements and the `__doc__` string; data flows into the `setup` function parameters, which are standard package metadata and dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The code is a typical setup script for a Python package.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules for package setup, modifies `sys.path`, and calls `setup()` with package metadata and dependencies. It references the `__doc__` string for description, which is standard. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or other suspicious activities. The code appears to be a straightforward package configuration script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to configure and install the package dependencies. No anomalies or malware indications are present.",
