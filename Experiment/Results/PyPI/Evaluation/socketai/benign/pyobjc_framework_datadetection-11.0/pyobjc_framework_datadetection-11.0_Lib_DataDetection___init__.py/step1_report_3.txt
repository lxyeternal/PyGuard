{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and sets up the Python mapping for the DataDetection framework, dynamically importing and configuring framework components.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (sys, Foundation, objc, _metadata), accesses framework path via objc.pathForFramework.",
  "sinks": "Calls to objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr, which dynamically creates framework directory and attribute functions.",
  "flows": "Imports _metadata -> calls objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr -> assigns __dir__ and __getattr__ -> unregisters method -> deletes module from sys.modules",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic framework loading and method registration without explicit security checks; deletion of module entry from sys.modules; no docstrings or documentation provided.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads and configures an Apple framework 'DataDetection' using Objective-C bridging. It creates directory and attribute functions for the framework, registers unavailable methods, and cleans up module entries. All actions are part of standard dynamic framework loading in macOS and do not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. No external data inputs or outputs are involved, and no network activity or data exfiltration is evident. The use of dynamic method registration is typical in Objective-C bridging but could be misused if misconfigured; however, in this context, it appears legitimate and controlled.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard dynamic framework setup for a macOS environment, involving no malicious behavior or security risks. It relies on legitimate system frameworks and dynamic method registration, with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
