{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically loads and sets up a Python binding for the macOS DataDetection framework, facilitating access to native Objective-C classes and methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, Foundation, objc, _metadata); objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr call; sys.modules manipulation",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of dynamically created framework methods, manipulation of sys.modules, creation of framework directory and attribute functions",
  "flows": "Import and call to createFrameworkDirAndGetattr (source), assignment of globals for __dir__ and __getattr__ (sink), removal of sys.modules entry (sink)",
  "anomalies": "Use of objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr for dynamic framework access, removal of internal module reference _metadata, deletion of _setup function from globals; no explicit hardcoded credentials or suspicious API calls",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads a system framework (DataDetection) using Objective-C bridge functions, creating directory and attribute getters. It registers unavailable methods and cleans up internal module references to prevent reinitialization. The use of dynamic attribute creation and framework loading is typical for Python bindings to system frameworks and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious data flows, and no obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard dynamic binding setup for a system framework in macOS, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a legitimate system interface module.",
