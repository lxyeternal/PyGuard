{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python interface to the macOS DataDetection framework by dynamically loading framework components and registering classes and methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, Foundation, objc, and a local _metadata module; dynamically loads framework files from system directories.",
  "sinks": "Calls to objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr, objc.registerUnavailableMethod, and deletion from sys.modules could potentially manipulate or load external resources or modify system state.",
  "flows": "Imports trigger dynamic framework loading; createFrameworkDirAndGetattr loads framework data; registerUnavailableMethod modifies method availability; deletion from sys.modules affects module state.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic framework loading and method registration indicates advanced runtime manipulation, which is complex but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious strings are present.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads a system framework 'DataDetection' using Objective-C bridge functions, setting up framework directory and attribute retrieval functions, and registering unavailable methods. It also removes an internal module from sys.modules. These actions are typical for setting up bindings to native system frameworks in Python and do not show signs of malicious intent. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The code relies on system directories and framework paths, indicating legitimate use of Apple's APIs. The removal of _metadata from sys.modules is a cleanup step. Overall, this is a controlled setup process with no suspicious or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for interfacing with a system framework, employing dynamic loading and registration. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent. The only notable activity is advanced runtime setup, which is typical for such bindings.",
