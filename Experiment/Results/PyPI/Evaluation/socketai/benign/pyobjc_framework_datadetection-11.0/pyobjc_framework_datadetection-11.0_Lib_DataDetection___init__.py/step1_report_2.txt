  "purpose": "Initialize and set up the DataDetection framework for use within a Python environment by dynamically loading Objective-C classes and framework resources.",
  "sources": "Import statements (sys, Foundation, objc, _metadata); dynamic framework loading via objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr; removal of _metadata module from sys.modules.",
  "sinks": "Globals assignment (__dir__, __getattr__); registration of unavailable methods; deletion of modules from sys.modules.",
  "flows": "Import sys and framework modules -> call createFrameworkDirAndGetattr -> assign __dir__ and __getattr__ to globals -> unregister unavailable methods -> delete _metadata from sys.modules.",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic method registration with registerUnavailableMethod; deletion of module entries from sys.modules; use of objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr for framework loading which may obscure actual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically loads a system framework (DataDetection) and sets up global functions for framework interaction, likely to facilitate later calls to native APIs. It unregisters certain methods to possibly prevent their use, and removes the _metadata module after setup, which might hide implementation details. No hardcoded credentials, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The dynamic method registration and framework loading are typical for bridging native code, not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily performs framework setup and dynamic method registration without evident malicious intent. Its behavior is consistent with a legitimate purpose of bridging Python with native macOS frameworks. No malware or security risks are apparent.",
