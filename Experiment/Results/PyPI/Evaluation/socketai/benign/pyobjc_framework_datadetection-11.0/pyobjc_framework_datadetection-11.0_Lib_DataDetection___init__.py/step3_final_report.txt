{
  "purpose": "Dynamically loads and sets up the DataDetection framework for use in Python, establishing attribute access and method registration.",
  "sources": "Imports sys, Foundation, objc, and _metadata; calls objc.createFrameworkDirAndGetattr to load framework; registers unavailable methods; deletes _metadata from sys.modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; framework setup code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "Imports and framework loading functions flow into setting globals (__dir__, __getattr__); method registration and cleanup are internal steps; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic framework loading and attribute creation, which could be misused if environment is compromised, but standard for system bindings; deletion of internal modules/functions is typical cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard macOS framework binding activities: dynamic loading, attribute setup, method registration, and cleanup. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The activities are typical for such bindings, and no suspicious behavior is evident. The risk is inherent in dynamic framework manipulation but justified in this context. The reports correctly identify no malicious activity, assigning malware scores of 0 and low obfuscation scores. The risk scores range from 0.1 to 0.3, reflecting cautious acknowledgment of potential misuse in compromised environments, but overall the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup for macOS native framework binding, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
