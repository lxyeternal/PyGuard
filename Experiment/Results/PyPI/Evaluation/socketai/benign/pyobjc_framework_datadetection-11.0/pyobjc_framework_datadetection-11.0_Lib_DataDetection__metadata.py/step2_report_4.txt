  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the descriptions.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is primarily about defining conditional functions based on system architecture and registering Objective-C method metadata.\n- No external inputs, network activity, or data leaks are present.\n- The code appears to be boilerplate or generated configuration for Objective-C interoperability.\n- The `objc.registerMetaDataForSelector` function is used to register metadata for a selector `isAllDay` on class `DDMatchCalendarEvent`.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The code is consistent with typical runtime setup or bridging code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of code:** The code matches the descriptions. It performs architecture-dependent function definitions and metadata registration.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected. No data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are apparent. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The code is straightforward and appears correct for its purpose. No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0 or very low, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for any higher scores:\n- No issues justify higher risk scores; the code is benign.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The reports are consistent with each other and with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.  \n**Risk score:** 0 — no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The code is standard for Objective-C runtime metadata registration, likely auto-generated.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are justified; the code appears legitimate.\n- No signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.\n\n**In conclusion,** I agree with the reports' assessments. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Estimated Score |\n|------------------|-----------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                     |\n| Security Risk    | 0                     |\n\n**All scores are appropriate given the code and reports.**",
