  "purpose": "Generated Objective-C metadata registration code for runtime method setup, defining functions based on system architecture and registering selector metadata.",
  "sources": "System architecture checks, Objective-C runtime registration functions",
  "sinks": "objc.registerMetaDataForSelector call, which registers method metadata within the Objective-C runtime",
  "flows": "Architecture-dependent functions (sel32or64, selAorI) influence runtime registration via registerMetaDataForSelector",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or external data processing observed",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, generated boilerplate for Objective-C interoperability, performing system checks and registering method metadata. No external inputs, network activity, or data leaks are present. The functions are simple conditionals based on system architecture, and the metadata registration is standard. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign, configuration nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard Objective-C runtime setup script. It contains no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
