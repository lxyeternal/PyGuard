{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be generated metadata for Objective-C bindings or reflection, likely used for interfacing with Objective-C runtime, specifically for setting selector metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading system information (sys.maxsize, objc.arch), static definitions, and registration functions (objc.registerMetaDataForSelector).",
  "sinks": "Registering metadata with Objective-C runtime, which could influence method behaviors but is not inherently harmful.",
  "flows": "System info and metadata registration data flow into Objective-C runtime functions for method metadata updates.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. Use of runtime metadata registration is typical in bridging code. No external inputs, user data, or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The script defines conditional functions based on system architecture and CPU architecture, updates metadata for a specific Objective-C selector, and performs minimal runtime modifications. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The code's purpose seems limited to setting method metadata. No anomalies or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward generated Objective-C runtime metadata registration script. It performs no malicious actions, contains no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and is consistent with typical bridging or reflection code. No security concerns are identified.",
