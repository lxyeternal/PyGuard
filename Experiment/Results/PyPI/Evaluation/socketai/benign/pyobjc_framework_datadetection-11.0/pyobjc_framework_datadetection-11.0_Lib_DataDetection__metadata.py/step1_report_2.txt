{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define conditional functions based on system architecture and architecture type, and registers metadata for Objective-C selectors, likely for a framework or application dealing with Objective-C runtime features.",
  "sources": "Reads system information (sys.maxsize, objc.arch), imports modules (objc, sys), and registers metadata via objc.registerMetaDataForSelector.",
  "sinks": "Metadata registration call (objc.registerMetaDataForSelector) could be a sink if it processes untrusted input, but here it uses hardcoded values and constants, so no immediate sink risk.",
  "flows": "System info (sys.maxsize, objc.arch) influences function definitions, which do not appear to process external data further. Metadata registration affects internal Objective-C runtime but does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated logic. The code is straightforward and appears to be boilerplate for Objective-C runtime setup.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up architecture-dependent functions and registers metadata for Objective-C selectors. All data used are hardcoded or system-determined, with no external inputs or outputs involved. The code does not perform network activity, data leaks, or any suspicious operations. The logic is standard for setting up runtime metadata in an Objective-C environment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign setup script for Objective-C runtime metadata registration. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard boilerplate code for such purposes.",
