{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be generated metadata and configuration for Objective-C interoperability, defining selector functions based on system architecture and setting metadata for Objective-C methods.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'objc' and 'sys'; reads system architecture and metadata registration calls",
  "sinks": "Metadata registration functions (objc.registerMetaDataForSelector); no data sinks involved",
  "flows": "System architecture info influences selector function definitions; metadata registration flows from code execution to Objective-C runtime",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code; dynamic function definitions based on architecture are normal in such contexts; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code checks system architecture and CPU architecture to define simple selector functions, then registers metadata for a specific Objective-C selector. It uses standard Python features and the 'objc' module, likely for Objective-C interoperability. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities are evident. The code is configuration/setup for Objective-C method metadata, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard generated metadata configuration for Objective-C method bindings, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It serves a legitimate purpose related to system architecture detection and metadata registration.",
