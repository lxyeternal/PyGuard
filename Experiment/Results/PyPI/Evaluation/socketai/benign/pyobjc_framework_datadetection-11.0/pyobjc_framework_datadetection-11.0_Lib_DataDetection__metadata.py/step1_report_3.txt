{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be generated metadata for Objective-C method registration, likely used for interfacing with macOS/iOS system frameworks.",
  "sources": "sys.maxsize, objc.arch, objc.registerMetaDataForSelector, possibly input from the system or environment variables",
  "sinks": "objc.registerMetaDataForSelector, objc._updatingMetadata",
  "flows": "sys.maxsize/objc.arch -> conditional functions; registerMetaDataForSelector -> metadata update",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional function definitions based on system architecture; metadata registration functions are called but without obvious malicious payload; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code sets up architecture-dependent functions, updates metadata registration for Objective-C selectors, and toggles internal update flags. The only function that performs an external action is 'objc.registerMetaDataForSelector', which registers metadata for a selector. This is a standard procedure in Objective-C interop, not inherently malicious. No suspicious data flows, input sources, or malicious behaviors are evident. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to metadata registration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard auto-generated Objective-C metadata registration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It merely sets up method metadata and toggles internal update states.",
