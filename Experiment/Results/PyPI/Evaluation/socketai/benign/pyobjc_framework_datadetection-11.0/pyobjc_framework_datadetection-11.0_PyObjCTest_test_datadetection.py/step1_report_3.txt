  "purpose": "Unit testing for the DataDetection module, verifying callable metadata sanity.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from PyObjCTools.TestSupport import TestCase' and 'import DataDetection'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points such as network, file I/O, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules to the test method, but no external data flows or untrusted sources detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code structures, or obfuscated code. The code uses standard test patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework component and a module called DataDetection. It defines a test class with a single test method that calls 'assertCallableMetadataIsSane' on DataDetection. No data input/output, network activity, or dangerous function calls are present. The test appears to verify internal module consistency without side effects. No suspicious or malicious behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard unit test code snippet with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a benign test for the DataDetection module.",
