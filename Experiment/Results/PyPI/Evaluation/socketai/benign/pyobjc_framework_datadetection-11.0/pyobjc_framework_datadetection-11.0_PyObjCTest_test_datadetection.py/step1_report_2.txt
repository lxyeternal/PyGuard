  "purpose": "Unit test for the DataDetection module's callable metadata sanity check",
  "sources": "Importing TestCase from PyObjCTools.TestSupport; importing DataDetection module",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure operations",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from sources to sinks; test invocation does not process external input",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework component and the DataDetection module, then defines a test case that calls a specific method to verify callable metadata. No user input, network communication, or sensitive data handling present. The imported modules are standard for unit testing and detection purposes. The test method asserts a property of the DataDetection module, which appears to be a normal test routine. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident based on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward unit test with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply performs a sanity check on the DataDetection module's callable metadata as part of standard testing procedures.",
