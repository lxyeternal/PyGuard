{
  "purpose": "Unit test for the DataDetection module to verify callable metadata sanity.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from PyObjCTools.TestSupport import TestCase' and 'import DataDetection'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data handling; no code execution or network operations.",
  "flows": "The test invokes 'assertCallableMetadataIsSane' method on the DataDetection module, which is a test validation function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears straightforward and consistent with standard testing practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework and a module named DataDetection, then runs a single test case to validate callable metadata. The imported modules are common and used for testing; no external data sources or sinks are present. The function name suggests a check for internal consistency of callable objects in DataDetection, not an attack vector or malicious behavior. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test script intended to validate the internal consistency of the DataDetection module's callable objects. It shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
