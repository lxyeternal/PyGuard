  "purpose": "Unit testing for DataDetection module using TestCase framework",
  "sources": "Import statement for DataDetection module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; straightforward test case structure",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing support module and a DataDetection module, then defines a test class with a single test method that calls an assertion on the DataDetection module. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or suspicious patterns. It appears to be a normal unit test setup with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test for a module, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
