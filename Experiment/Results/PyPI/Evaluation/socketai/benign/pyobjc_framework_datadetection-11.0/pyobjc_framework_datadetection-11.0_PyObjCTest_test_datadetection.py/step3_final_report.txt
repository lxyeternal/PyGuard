{
  "purpose": "This code is a unit test verifying the internal callable metadata of the DataDetection module.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported DataDetection module when calling assertCallableMetadataIsSane(DataDetection).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The source (DataDetection module) is passed directly to the assertion method, with no data flow to external systems or untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard for a unit test.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework and the DataDetection module, then runs a single internal consistency check. There are no network operations, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. The code's purpose is to verify internal callable metadata, which is a benign operation. All signals indicate no malicious intent, and the code structure is simple and clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
