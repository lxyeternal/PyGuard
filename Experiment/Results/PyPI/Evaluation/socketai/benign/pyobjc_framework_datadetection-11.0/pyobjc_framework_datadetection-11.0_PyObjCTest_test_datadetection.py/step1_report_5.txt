  "purpose": "Unit test for the DataDetection package's callable metadata sanity check.",
  "sources": "Import statements: PyObjCTools.TestSupport and DataDetection module.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from import statements into test method execution, but no untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code is a standard test case setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing support module and a package named DataDetection. It defines a single test case that calls a method 'assertCallableMetadataIsSane' on the DataDetection package. This pattern suggests a standard unit test to verify the integrity of callable metadata in the package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. It is a straightforward test case setup intended for code validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign unit test with no malicious intent. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The code is safe based on the provided content.",
