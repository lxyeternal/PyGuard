  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its behavior, and the reasoning provided.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard build setup for PyObjC, performing system info gathering via subprocess, reading SDK info, and modifying build/test commands accordingly.\n- **Key points:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, subprocess calls are legitimate, no obfuscated code, no malicious payloads.\n- **Risk assessment:** The report assigns a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. The confidence is high (0.9). The overall security risk is minimal.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is reasonable. The code is typical for build scripts, with no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on build/test setup, environment variables, and system info retrieval via subprocess.\n- **Key points:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, subprocess calls are standard, no suspicious network activity.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the code's behavior. Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment appears accurate. The code is legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on system info collection, environment setup, and test module loading, primarily via subprocess and filesystem reads.\n- **Key points:** No malicious activity, no network communication, subprocess calls are controlled, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score is 0, matching the code's behavior. Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis is sound. No malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing environment detection, SDK info, and test management.\n- **Key points:** No suspicious activity, subprocess calls are standard, no backdoors or data exfiltration, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score is 0, consistent with the code. Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Verdict:** The evaluation is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on build/test configuration, system info gathering, and test module loading.\n- **Key points:** No malicious activity, subprocess calls are standard, no secrets or backdoors, environment variables are used as intended.\n- **Risk assessment:** Malware score is 0, matching the code's behavior. Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** Low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting the nature of build scripts.\n\n### My own assessment:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis and the code's purpose, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a legitimate build and test setup for a Python extension package, performing system info collection, environment setup, and test management.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, typical build environment risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is standard, well-understood build and test automation code, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
