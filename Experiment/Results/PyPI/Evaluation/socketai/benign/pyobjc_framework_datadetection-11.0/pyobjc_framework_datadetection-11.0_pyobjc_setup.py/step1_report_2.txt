{
  "purpose": "This script facilitates building, testing, and packaging the PyObjC framework wrappers for macOS, including custom build commands, environment setup, and SDK detection.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables (e.g., CFLAGS, PATH), system commands (sw_vers, xcrun, clang), configuration files (SDKSettings.plist), and filesystem reads (files in SDKs and package metadata).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through subprocess output handling, file reads (SDK info, package metadata), and environment variables; manipulation of sys.path and sys.modules for test setup/teardown; system commands may leak info via their output if captured or logged.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and system commands into variables used for configuration and build steps; SDK paths and versions are obtained from filesystem and system commands; test setup modifies sys.path based on package info; subprocess outputs are read and used for SDK and version info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, no attempts at code concealment. Usage of subprocess calls for system info is standard but could be exploited if system commands are compromised. No unusual code behaviors or hidden backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages build and test processes, retrieving system information and SDK details through standard subprocess calls and filesystem reads. It includes environment-dependent logic for SDK detection and compilation flags. No evidence of malicious code such as network transmission, backdoors, or data theft. Usage of subprocess is controlled and does not involve external untrusted input. The code does perform environment setup and teardown for tests, which is standard for such scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a standard, well-structured build and test helper for a Python extension package. It does not contain malicious behaviors, backdoors, or malware. Its actions are typical for a build environment, focusing on environment configuration, SDK detection, and test management. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
