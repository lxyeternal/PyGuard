  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The report concludes that the script is a legitimate build setup for PyObjC, with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. It emphasizes the use of subprocess calls for system info, which is standard in build scripts, and notes no suspicious network activity or obfuscated code.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The subprocess calls are used solely for system info, typical for build scripts. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The low risk score aligns with this.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. I agree with a malware score of 0, obfuscated 0, and a very low security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard build and test procedures, with no signs of malicious activity. The subprocess calls are used for SDK detection and system info, which is normal.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1\n\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. No malicious or obfuscated code detected. The environment setup and subprocess usage are typical.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on system info gathering via subprocess, environment variables, and dynamic module loading for tests. It notes no suspicious activity, no data exfiltration, and no malicious code.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score due to extensive system info collection, but still within normal bounds for build scripts. No signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. The risk is minimal; no adjustment needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, highlighting environment detection, SDK info, and test setup. No network activity or malicious behavior observed.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments. The code performs standard build and environment setup tasks.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on build and test setup, with system info gathering, environment variables, and dynamic module imports. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2\n\n- **Assessment:** The activities are typical for build scripts. No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code performs system info gathering and build setup, which are legitimate activities.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and standard.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0, but still low (0.1-0.2). The scripts do gather system info and modify environment variables, but these are typical for build scripts.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low, standard build environment activities)\n\n---\n\n**Final conclusion:** The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified. No adjustments needed.",
