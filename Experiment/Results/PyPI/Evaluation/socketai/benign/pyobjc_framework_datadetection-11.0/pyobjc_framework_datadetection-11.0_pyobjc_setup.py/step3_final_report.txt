{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup and build configuration script for the PyObjC framework, managing compilation, testing, SDK detection, and environment setup for building Python extension modules on macOS.",
  "sources": "Uses subprocess to gather system information (e.g., sw_vers, clang version, SDK paths), reads plist files for SDK info, reads package metadata, and dynamically imports test modules.",
  "sinks": "Modifies sys.path for test execution, writes build info files, and executes system commands for environment detection; no data is sent externally or stored maliciously.",
  "flows": "System info commands (subprocess) provide data to variables used in build configuration; test modules are loaded dynamically; environment variables influence build flags.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; subprocess calls are controlled and used for legitimate system info retrieval; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard build and test setup tasks, including system info collection via subprocess, SDK detection, environment configuration, and dynamic test loading. All subprocess calls are to trusted system utilities. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's activities are typical for build scripts, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build and test setup script for a Python extension package, with no malicious activity or security issues detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1).",
