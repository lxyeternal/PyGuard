{
  "purpose": "Generate PKCE code verifier and code challenge for OAuth2 authentication flows.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as 'length' and 'code_verifier', and uses the 'secrets' module for generating secure random strings.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points include returning sensitive code verifiers and challenges; no external sinks or network communications are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated, then 'secrets.token_urlsafe' generates random strings; these are hashed and encoded to produce code challenges. No untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors; the functions use standard cryptographic and random generation methods consistent with PKCE specifications. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code properly validates input parameters for length, uses 'secrets' for cryptographically secure random string generation, and hashes/verifies data using standard 'hashlib' functions. The encoding process follows PKCE specifications, with proper handling of string manipulations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and employs best practices for generating secure tokens.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation for generating PKCE code verifiers and challenges. No malicious intent or malicious code segments are detected. The functions perform standard cryptographic operations consistent with their purpose, with no suspicious behaviors or security issues.",
