  "purpose": "Generate PKCE code verifier and code challenge for OAuth 2.0 security.",
  "sources": "secrets.token_urlsafe for random string; hashlib.sha256 for hashing; base64.urlsafe_b64encode for encoding.",
  "sinks": "None; all data processed internally, no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input length validation -> random string generation -> hashing -> encoding -> output.",
  "anomalies": "Minor issue in get_code_challenge: using '[:-1]' to strip padding instead of 'rstrip('=')', which may cause non-standard padding removal but not a security flaw.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard PKCE generation functions using secure libraries. Input validation is correct. The random string generation is cryptographically secure. Hashing and encoding follow PKCE specs, aside from a minor padding removal method that could be improved for RFC compliance. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate given the code's purpose and implementation. Overall, the code is a legitimate, secure, and standard implementation with negligible risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a proper, secure PKCE utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. Minor technical note on padding removal can be addressed for full RFC compliance, but it does not impact security. Scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
