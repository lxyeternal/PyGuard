{
  "purpose": "Configure and set up the 'pkce' Python package for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data sinks present in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A, the code only reads a file and sets up package metadata without external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no unusual code constructs, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscated code. The package data and metadata seem standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and reads a README.md file for the long description. It then calls setuptools.setup() with typical package metadata including name, version, author info, description, license, URL, package data, package list, classifiers, and Python requirement. All elements are standard for Python package setup. There are no signs of malicious code, hidden backdoors, external network activity, or suspicious logic. The code strictly performs package configuration without executing untrusted or external code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It only performs standard setup procedures for the Python package 'pkce'.",
