  "purpose": "Standard setup script for packaging a Python project named 'pkce'.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description; static package metadata in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads local file -> passes static data to setuptools.setup() without dynamic processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward, conventional setup script with no suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, reads a local README.md for description, and calls setuptools.setup() with static, predefined metadata. It contains no dynamic code, no user input, no environment variable influence, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The code follows standard packaging practices and is free from suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious intent. All signals indicate a benign, typical setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python packaging script with no malicious or security concerns. The uniform reports' scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are accurate and appropriate.",
