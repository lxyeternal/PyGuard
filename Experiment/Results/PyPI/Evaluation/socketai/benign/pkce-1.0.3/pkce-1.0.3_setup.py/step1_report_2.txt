  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the 'pkce' Python package, including reading the README and specifying package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long_description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Reading file content, then passing static data into setuptools.setup() function; no untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a local 'README.md' file to include its content as the long_description, then calls setuptools.setup() with static metadata parameters. All data used is predefined or local files, with no external input or untrusted data sources. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. Usage of standard packaging practices and no obfuscation or dynamic code execution present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs expected operations for packaging without any suspicious or harmful actions.",
