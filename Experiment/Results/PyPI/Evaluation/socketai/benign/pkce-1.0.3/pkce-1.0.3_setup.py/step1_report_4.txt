  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'pkce' Python package for distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.md' content, then uses it in package setup; no external data flows or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. All operations are standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for packaging, reads a README file for long description, and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with package metadata. All steps follow conventional packaging patterns. No malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no external data or network activity. The content appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package, with no anomalies or hidden functions.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard Python package setup file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions solely to configure package distribution. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
