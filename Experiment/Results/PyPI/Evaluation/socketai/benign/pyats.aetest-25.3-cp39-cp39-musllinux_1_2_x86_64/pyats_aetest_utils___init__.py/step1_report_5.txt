  "purpose": "Utility functions for introspection, error handling, and debugging in Python, particularly for test frameworks or script analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function objects, class objects, traceback objects, environment variables, and module imports.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive operations include importing modules, accessing source files, printing output, and calling sys.exit.",
  "flows": "Input from inspect functions and attributes flows into decision branches for error handling, debugging, and source code analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs detected. Use of inspect.unwrap and dynamic module import is standard for introspection. No obfuscated code or malicious payloads identified.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides introspection utilities such as retrieving function signatures, source files, class information, and filtering tracebacks. It also includes error handling and debugging support with start_pdb. No operations involve network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. All functions perform typical introspection and debugging tasks, with safe use of standard libraries. No anomalies or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of introspection and utility functions for debugging and error handling, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is designed for safe debugging and analysis in a testing or scripting environment.",
