  "purpose": "Import classes 'Steps' and 'Step' from the local module 'implementation' to be used within the current package or module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package/module, specifically 'from .implementation import Steps, Step'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flows from source to sink within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and follows standard Python import syntax; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "This code simply performs a relative import of two classes from a module named 'implementation'. There are no inputs, no untrusted data sources, and no data processing or external communications involved. The structure is typical for Python packages. No suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent based solely on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a straightforward import of classes from a local module.",
