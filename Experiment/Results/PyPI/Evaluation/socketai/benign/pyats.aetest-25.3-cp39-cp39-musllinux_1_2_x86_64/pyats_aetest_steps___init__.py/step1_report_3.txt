{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes 'Steps' and 'Step' from a local module 'implementation', likely for use within a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module './implementation'",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions identified",
  "flows": "No data flows observed; import statement is static and does not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs. It does not include hardcoded secrets or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs an import from a local module, which is common and standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no external network activity, no embedded secrets, and no complex logic or dynamic execution. The minimal nature limits any risk assessment to the import statement itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing a standard import from a local module. No malicious intent or security concerns are evident.",
