  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a relative module. There is no evidence of data processing, input/output operations, or malicious behavior. The minimal nature of the code indicates it's part of a larger project, but on its own, it poses no security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, performing a standard import operation without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
