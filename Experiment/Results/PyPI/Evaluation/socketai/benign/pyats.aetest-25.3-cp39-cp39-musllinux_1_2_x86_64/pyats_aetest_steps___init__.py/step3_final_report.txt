  "purpose": "This code imports classes 'Steps' and 'Step' from a local module 'implementation', serving as a structural component in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module 'implementation'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the import simply loads classes into the namespace.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import of classes from a local module, with no embedded logic, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The high confidence scores reflect certainty about its benign status. Given the lack of additional context, the code appears safe, and no further action is necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The current assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
