  "purpose": "Importing classes 'Steps' and 'Step' from a local module 'implementation'.",
  "sources": "The import statement at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only contains an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only an import statement; no anomalies detected in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "This code imports specific classes from a local module, which is typical in modular Python projects. There are no embedded malicious actions, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The code's simplicity and lack of execution or data handling reduce the likelihood of malicious intent. No external data sources, sinks, or obfuscated elements are present. Without additional context, this appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code fragment is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is unlikely to contain malware or obfuscation based on this snippet alone.",
