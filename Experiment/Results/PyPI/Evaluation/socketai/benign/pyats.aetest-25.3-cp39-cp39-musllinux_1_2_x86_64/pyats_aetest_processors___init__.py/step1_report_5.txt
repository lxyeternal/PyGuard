{
  "purpose": "This code appears to declare a module as infrastructure-related and imports various decorators for processing, skipping, and global processor discovery.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources or user input handling present",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs",
  "anomalies": "Use of the module-level variable __aetest_infra__ to flag infrastructure, which is benign; import of decorators without further code does not indicate malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines a module-level flag and imports functions from other modules. It includes no user input handling, no data processing, and no network operations or file manipulations. The imported decorators may be used elsewhere but are not malicious themselves. There are no suspicious or malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present. The code is straightforward and seems to set up infrastructure support.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as infrastructure setup with imports and a module flag. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
