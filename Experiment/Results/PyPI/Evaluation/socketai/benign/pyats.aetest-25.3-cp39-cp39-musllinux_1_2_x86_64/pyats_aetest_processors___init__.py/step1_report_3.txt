{
  "purpose": "The code sets a module marker and imports decorators for processing and skipping functionality, likely as part of a testing or processing framework.",
  "sources": "The module declaration (__aetest_infra__), and the imports from relative modules (.decorator, .skips).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; imports and module variables do not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors detected. The code appears to be standard module setup and documentation comments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module-level flag (__aetest_infra__) and imports specific decorators intended for use in testing or processing workflows. There are no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or insecure practices. The comments suggest intended usage but do not execute any malicious or suspicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module setup with imports for decorators and skip functions, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger framework.",
