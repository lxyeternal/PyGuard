  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the details provided.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Declares a module-level flag `__aetest_infra__ = True`.\n- Imports a decorator `discover_global_processors` from `.decorator`.\n- Aliases `.decorator.ProcessorDecorator` as `processors`.\n- Imports skip functions: `skip`, `skipIf`, `skipUnless` from `.skips`.\n- Contains comments indicating usage in a testing or processing framework.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly identifies that the code sets a module flag, imports decorators, and contains no malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0\n- **Conclusion:** Valid, accurate, and reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, confirms benign setup code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same observations; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0\n- **Conclusion:** Sound.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Consistent with previous; straightforward setup code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Also aligns with previous; no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None detected. The code is purely setup and import statements.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation patterns or suspicious constructs.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero, as there's no code executing untrusted data, network activity, or malicious behavior.\n- **Scores consistency:** All scores are aligned with the code's nature.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk score:** Since the code is benign and configuration/setup, a score of 0 is appropriate. No justification exists for raising it above 0.5.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n- The code is standard infrastructure setup for a testing or processing framework.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
