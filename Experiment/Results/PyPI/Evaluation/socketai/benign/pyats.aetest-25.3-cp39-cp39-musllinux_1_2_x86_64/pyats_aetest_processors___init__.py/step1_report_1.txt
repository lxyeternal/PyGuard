{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module-level flags and import decorators and skip functions for use in a larger testing or processing framework.",
  "sources": "No direct input or data reading occurs within this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flow points where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident within this snippet; it primarily sets up imports and module variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious hardcoded secrets, obfuscated patterns, or unusual behavior. The use of module flags and import statements is typical and benign.",
  "analysis": "The module sets a flag indicating it is infrastructure-related, imports a decorator for discovering global processors, and re-exports a processor decorator for API use. It also imports skip functions for conditional test skipping. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation. The code is clean, with no external data or untrusted inputs involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module setup for a processing or testing framework, containing no malicious or security-risk behavior. It primarily establishes imports and module flags without any suspicious activity.",
