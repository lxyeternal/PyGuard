  "purpose": "Define module metadata and import decorators for processing workflows.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.decorator, .skips) and assignment to a module-level variable.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or cause security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; mainly module setup and import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a module flag, imports decorators, and provides comments for usage. All code appears straightforward and related to workflow configuration. No user input handling, data processing, or external communication is present. The code is simple, with no indicators of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with import statements and a module-level flag. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and intended for configuration purposes.",
