  "purpose": "Module setup for a processing/testing framework, defining a module flag and importing decorators and skip functions.",
  "sources": "Module-level flag declaration (__aetest_infra__ = True), imports from .decorator and .skips modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "Import statements and module flag declaration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a module flag and import statements for decorators and skip functions. It contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data processing. The code structure is typical for a framework setup. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, assign malware and risk scores of 0, and have high confidence levels. The code's simplicity and clarity support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, benign infrastructure setup code with no malicious intent or security risks. The existing reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
