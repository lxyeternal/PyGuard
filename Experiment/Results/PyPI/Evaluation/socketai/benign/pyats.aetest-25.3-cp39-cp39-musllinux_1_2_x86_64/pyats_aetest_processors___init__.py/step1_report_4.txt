{
  "purpose": "This code module appears to set up infrastructure for a processing framework, including decorators and flags for skipping tests or processes.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.decorator, .skips), setting a module-level variable (__aetest_infra__ = True)",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or sensitive data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code mainly involves imports and variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected. Usage of module-level flags is typical for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module-level variable __aetest_infra__ as True, likely to mark the module as infrastructure. It imports specific functions and classes from local modules, namely discover_global_processors, ProcessorDecorator (aliased as processors), and skip functions. The comments suggest this module facilitates API decorators for processing functions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling occurs. The code appears to be standard setup code for a Python framework, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup module for a processing framework, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It mainly involves importing and setting configuration flags, which is typical for such infrastructure code.",
