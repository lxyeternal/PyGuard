  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in this single line of code",
  "flows": "No data flow observed within this snippet; potential flows depend on subsequent code using DatafileLoader",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscation present in this import statement",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward import statement using relative import syntax to bring in DatafileLoader from a sibling module named loader. It is a standard Python import and does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No malicious behavior or security issues are detectable solely from this statement.",
  "conclusion": "This import statement appears benign, standard, and unrelated to malicious activity. There is no indication of malware or security risks in this code fragment.",
