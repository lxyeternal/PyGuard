{
  "purpose": "This code imports the DatafileLoader class from a local module named loader, likely for data processing or loading tasks within a larger project.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module 'loader' to access 'DatafileLoader'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only performs a static import without dynamic data or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected; the code is a straightforward import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard Python import statement importing 'DatafileLoader' from a local module 'loader'. It involves no data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. The absence of suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious code indicates a benign purpose. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent. No anomalies or security concerns are evident, and the code aligns with best practices for benign module imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign, standard import statement with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
