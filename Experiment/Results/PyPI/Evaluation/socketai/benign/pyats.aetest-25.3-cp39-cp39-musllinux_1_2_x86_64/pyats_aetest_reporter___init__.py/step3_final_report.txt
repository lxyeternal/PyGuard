{
  "purpose": "The code imports classes AEReporter and StandaloneReporter from local modules, likely for reporting or logging purposes within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.aereport and .default).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements from local modules, with no data processing, external communication, or malicious code. The imported classes are probably used for reporting functions, which is common in modular applications. There are no signs of obfuscation, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code. The confidence scores are high, reflecting the straightforward analysis. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities evident. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security posture based on this snippet is very low risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
