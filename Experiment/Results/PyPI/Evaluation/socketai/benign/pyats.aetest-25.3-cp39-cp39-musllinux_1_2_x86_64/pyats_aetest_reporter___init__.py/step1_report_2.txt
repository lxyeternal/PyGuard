  "flows": "No data flows are visible in this snippet since it only contains import statements without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious activity detected in the import statements alone.",
  "analysis": "This code consists solely of import statements importing two classes from local modules. There are no data inputs, no processing, and no external communications. Without additional context or code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security issues. The imports suggest modular design for reporting features.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import of local classes used for reporting. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks based solely on these lines.",
