  "purpose": "The code imports classes 'AEReporter' and 'StandaloneReporter' from local modules for reporting functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing classes from local modules within the package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows present; only import statements without execution logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, indicating setup or configuration for reporting components. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities. It does not contain any code execution, data handling, or external communication, which are typical indicators of malicious intent. The absence of such code suggests this is standard package importation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as part of a larger codebase to import reporting classes. There are no signs of malware or security risks in this snippet.",
