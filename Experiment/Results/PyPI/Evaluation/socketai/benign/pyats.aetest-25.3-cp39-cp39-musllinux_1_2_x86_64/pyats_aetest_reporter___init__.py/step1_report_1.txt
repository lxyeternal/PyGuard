{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import two modules, AEReporter and StandaloneReporter, likely for reporting or logging purposes within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.aereport and .default), which may contain functions or classes that could read data from the application or environment.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include methods or functions invoked by the imported classes, which are not shown here. The import statements themselves are not sinks.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow is shown in this snippet. Importing modules does not constitute a data flow unless their methods are invoked elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are evident in this minimal snippet. The import statements are standard and unremarkable.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports two classes from local modules. Without additional context or usage, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The imports could be part of legitimate functionality for reporting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risk based solely on these import statements. The code appears benign and standard.",
