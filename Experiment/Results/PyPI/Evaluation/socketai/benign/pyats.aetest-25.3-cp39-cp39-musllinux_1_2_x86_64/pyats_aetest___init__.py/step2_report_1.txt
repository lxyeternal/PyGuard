  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module setup for the aetest testing framework.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or user input handling is present.\n- The code consists mainly of metadata, configuration variables, and static import statements.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors, is detected.\n- The code appears to be a standard package initialization script, serving as an organizational and configuration setup.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis that no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation or code hiding techniques.\n- **Risk scores:** All are 0, consistent with the above findings.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are consistent and thorough, with no indication of security concerns.\n- The only point worth noting is that the code relies on internal modules (.main, .commons, etc.), but these are standard for a package and do not imply malicious intent.\n- The documentation and import statements are standard and do not suggest any hidden malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, well-structured module setup for a testing framework.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and justified.\n- No adjustments are necessary based on the provided analysis.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\nThis code is safe and typical for its purpose.",
