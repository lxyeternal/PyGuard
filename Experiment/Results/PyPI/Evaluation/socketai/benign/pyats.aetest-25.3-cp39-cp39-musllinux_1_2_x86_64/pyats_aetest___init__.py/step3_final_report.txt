{
  "purpose": "This code initializes the 'aetest' testing framework module, setting metadata, configuration variables, and importing necessary components for test script execution.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from internal modules (.main, .commons, .loop, etc.) and configuration variables defined at the module level.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or outputs; the code does not process external input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code primarily establishes static imports and configuration; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup module for the 'aetest' framework, consisting of metadata, configuration variables, and import statements. It does not execute dynamic code, handle user input, or perform network operations. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The import statements are from internal modules, indicating a controlled environment. The code's purpose is organizational, serving as a foundation for test scripts. Given the static nature and lack of suspicious patterns, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, static initialization module for a testing framework with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are justified and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
