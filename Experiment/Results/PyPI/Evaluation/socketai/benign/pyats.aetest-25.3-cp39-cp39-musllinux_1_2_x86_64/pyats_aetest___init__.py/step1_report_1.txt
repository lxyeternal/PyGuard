{
  "purpose": "Define base classes and configuration for aetest testing framework, facilitating test script creation and integration with pyATS.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.main, .commons, .loop, etc.) and module-level variable definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; imports are static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of module-level metadata, configuration variables, and a series of import statements from internal modules. All imports are static and seem intended for setting up a testing framework. No dynamic execution, network activity, or potentially malicious code is present. The module appears to be a straightforward setup for a test framework without any obfuscated or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a configuration and import module for the aetest testing framework. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. It appears safe and intentionally designed for test setup purposes.",
