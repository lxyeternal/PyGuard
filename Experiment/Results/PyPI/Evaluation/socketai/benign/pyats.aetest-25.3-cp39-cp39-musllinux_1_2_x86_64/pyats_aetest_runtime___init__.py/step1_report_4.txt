  "purpose": "Initialize a RuntimeInfo object and replace the current module in sys.modules with this object, attaching module attributes to it.",
  "sources": "Imports the sys module; imports RuntimeInfo from a relative implementation module; accesses module special attributes (__file__, __loader__, __package__, __name__, __spec__, __doc__).",
  "sinks": "Replaces the current module in sys.modules with a RuntimeInfo object; sets module attributes on this object, which could potentially affect module behavior.",
  "flows": "sys.modules[__name__] (source) is replaced by runtime (sink); module attributes are copied to runtime, potentially affecting module identity and behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Replacing the module object with an instance of RuntimeInfo is unconventional and could be used to hide or manipulate module attributes; no other suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and a RuntimeInfo class, then replaces the module's entry in sys.modules with an instance of RuntimeInfo. It then assigns common module attributes (__file__, __loader__, __package__, __name__, __spec__, __doc__) to this RuntimeInfo instance. This pattern is unusual and could be used to obscure module identity or behavior. However, there are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution. The code's intent appears to be to customize or obfuscate module attributes, which could be suspicious in some contexts but not necessarily malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs module attribute manipulation by replacing the module object with an instance of RuntimeInfo and assigning attributes to it. This pattern is unconventional but not inherently malicious. No malware or security threats are evident; it appears to be a form of obfuscation or customization.",
