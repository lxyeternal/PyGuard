  "purpose": "Initialize a RuntimeInfo object and replace the current module in sys.modules with this object, attaching some module attributes to it.",
  "sources": "Import statement for sys and local import of RuntimeInfo; reading __file__, __loader__, __package__, __name__, __spec__, __doc__",
  "sinks": "Assignment to sys.modules[__name__], setting attributes on runtime object",
  "flows": "Import sys -> create RuntimeInfo instance -> assign sys.modules[__name__] -> set runtime attributes from module variables",
  "anomalies": "Replacing the module entry in sys.modules with a runtime object is unusual; no visible external data input or output; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module and a local RuntimeInfo class, then replaces the current module in sys.modules with an instance of RuntimeInfo. It then assigns several module-level special attributes (__file__, __loader__, etc.) to this runtime object. This pattern is unconventional but not inherently malicious. It appears intended to wrap the module's identity and metadata within a RuntimeInfo object, possibly for custom runtime management or obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious control flow. No external data input, network activity, or secret handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is unconventional but does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks. It mainly manipulates module registration and attributes for potentially advanced runtime handling. No malicious behavior or supply chain attack indicators are present.",
