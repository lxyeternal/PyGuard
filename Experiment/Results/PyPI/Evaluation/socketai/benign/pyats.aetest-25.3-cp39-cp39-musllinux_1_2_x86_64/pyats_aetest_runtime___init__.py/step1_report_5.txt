{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a RuntimeInfo object and assigns it to the current module, setting various module attributes to the runtime instance.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module attributes (__file__, __loader__, __package__, __name__, __spec__, __doc__) and imports RuntimeInfo from a local implementation module.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns the runtime object to sys.modules[__name__], which could affect module behavior; however, no untrusted data sources or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Module attributes are assigned to the runtime object, and sys.modules is modified to replace the current module with the runtime object.",
  "anomalies": "The code replaces its module object with an instance, which is unusual and can potentially obscure module attributes or behavior. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, external data leaks, or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports RuntimeInfo, then assigns an instance of it to the current module within sys.modules. It also sets several special module attributes on this runtime object. This pattern is unusual but not inherently malicious; it may be used for advanced runtime or debugging purposes. No external inputs, user data, or network activity is involved. No obfuscation or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign pattern for setting up a runtime environment or debugging context. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. Its unusual approach to module management warrants caution but does not suggest malicious behavior.",
