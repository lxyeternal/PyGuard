  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for managing Poetry within a Nox session. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The external command executions are controlled and based on local configuration, with no untrusted input influencing their parameters. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
