{
  "purpose": "Provides an interface for managing Poetry package operations within a Nox session, including reading configuration, exporting requirements, and building distributions.",
  "sources": "Reads 'pyproject.toml' for configuration; executes external commands ('poetry --version', 'poetry export', 'poetry build') via session.run_always.",
  "sinks": "External command execution with parameters derived from local configuration; no untrusted input directly influences commands.",
  "flows": "Reads configuration -> executes commands -> parses output -> returns results; no untrusted data flows into commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns; standard regex and subprocess usage.",
  "analysis": "The code reads local configuration files and executes controlled external commands to manage Poetry projects. It parses command outputs for version info and build artifacts. No user input or network activity is involved. The command parameters are derived from local, trusted configuration. Error handling is appropriate, and no malicious or obfuscated code is present. The regex for version parsing is standard. The code's purpose aligns with typical package management utilities, with no signs of malicious intent or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for managing Poetry within a Nox session. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The external command executions are controlled and based on local configuration, with no untrusted input influencing their parameters. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
