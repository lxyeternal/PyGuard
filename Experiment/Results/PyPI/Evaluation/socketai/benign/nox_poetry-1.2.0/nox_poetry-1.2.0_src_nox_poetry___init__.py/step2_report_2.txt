  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**1. Code Content and Functionality:**\n- The code is a straightforward module that imports specific classes and functions from `nox_poetry.poetry` and `nox_poetry.sessions`.\n- It defines two constants, `WHEEL` and `SDIST`, referencing `DistributionFormat.WHEEL` and `DistributionFormat.SDIST`.\n- It exports these constants along with `Session` and `session`.\n- The code includes descriptive docstrings explaining its purpose as a utility for integrating Poetry with Nox sessions.\n- There are no user inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- The code is primarily configuration, import, and export statements.\n\n**2. Security Analysis:**\n- No untrusted data handling, user input, or network operations.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive data.\n- No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.\n- No signs of malicious behavior or backdoors.\n- The code appears to be a benign interface or setup module.\n\n**3. Logical and Structural Flaws:**\n- The code is well-structured, clear, and consistent.\n- No errors, flaws, or mistakes are evident.\n- The purpose and functionality are transparent and standard for such modules.\n\n**4. Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n- All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0.\n- The code contains no obfuscation or malicious constructs.\n- The malware score is correctly 0, reflecting no malicious intent.\n\n**5. Risk Scores:**\n- All reports assign a security risk score of 0.\n- Given the benign nature, this is appropriate.\n- No reason to adjust these scores.\n\n**6. Consistency and Validity of Reports:**\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify the code as a benign, standard module with no security issues.\n\n**7. Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is cautious and accurate.\n- The reports correctly interpret the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, well-documented Python module that imports classes and constants, defines some constants, and exports them. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The purpose is clear, and the code does not process untrusted data or perform any security-sensitive operations.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, with no security risks or malware indications. The assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the nature of the code.",
