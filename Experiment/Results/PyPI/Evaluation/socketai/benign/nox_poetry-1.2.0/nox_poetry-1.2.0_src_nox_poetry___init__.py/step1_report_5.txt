{
  "purpose": "The code provides documentation and interface for a nox plugin that integrates Poetry into session management, enabling package management and build tasks within testing sessions.",
  "sources": "The code reads imported modules (`nox_poetry.poetry`, `nox_poetry.sessions`) and the constants `DistributionFormat.WHEEL`, `DistributionFormat.SDIST`.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports modules and assigns constants based on those modules, with no data flow from external inputs to security-critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of import statements, constant definitions, and documentation strings. It defines constants referencing `DistributionFormat` attributes, and exposes functions and classes for package management. There are no data processing, user input handling, or security-sensitive operations. The structure appears standard for a package interface module. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward interface and documentation for a nox plugin that integrates Poetry. It contains no suspicious or malicious activity and appears safe.",
