  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose:** Explains that the code provides a wrapper and utility functions for Poetry within Nox sessions.  \n- **Sources:** Imports from `nox_poetry.poetry` and `nox_poetry.sessions`, constants, and `__all__`.  \n- **Analysis:** The code is straightforward, importing modules, defining constants, and exporting symbols. No dynamic code, user input, or network activity.  \n- **Malware, obfuscated, risk:** All zero.  \n- **Verdict:** Benign, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose:** Provides a drop-in replacement for nox sessions, enabling Poetry-based package management.  \n- **Sources:** Same as above.  \n- **Analysis:** Static imports, constants, no runtime data flow, no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Malware, obfuscated, risk:** All zero.  \n- **Verdict:** Benign.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose:** Documentation and import statements for a package facilitating Poetry within Nox.  \n- **Sources:** Same as above.  \n- **Analysis:** No code execution, no user input, no external system interaction.  \n- **Malware, obfuscated, risk:** Zero.  \n- **Verdict:** Benign.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose:** Documentation and setup for a package integrating Poetry with Nox sessions.  \n- **Sources:** Same import patterns.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard module setup, no dynamic or external data handling.  \n- **Malware, obfuscated, risk:** Zero.  \n- **Verdict:** Benign.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose:** Interface for a nox plugin that integrates Poetry.  \n- **Sources:** Imports and constants referencing `DistributionFormat`.  \n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity, no data flow from untrusted sources, standard structure.  \n- **Malware, obfuscated, risk:** Zero.  \n- **Verdict:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is purely for module setup, constants, and imports.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident; all reports consistently find no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** The malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores are all 0 across reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:** Not applicable; no suspicious or malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, as expected.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n- **Consistency of scores:** The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\nThis code is a benign, standard module that provides constants, imports, and documentation for integrating Poetry with Nox sessions. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese are appropriate given the content and analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is safe, straightforward, and serves as a configuration and interface module for Poetry and Nox integration. No security concerns or malicious intent are evident.",
