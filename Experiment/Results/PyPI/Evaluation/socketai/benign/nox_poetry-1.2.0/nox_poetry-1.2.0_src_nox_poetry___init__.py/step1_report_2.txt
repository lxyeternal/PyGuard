{
  "purpose": "The code provides a drop-in replacement for nox sessions, enabling Poetry-based package management and distribution in a testing environment.",
  "sources": "Import statements from nox_poetry.poetry and nox_poetry.sessions, and the module-level constants WHEEL and SDIST.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code mainly imports modules and defines constants without executing untrusted data or performing sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Imports are static and define constants; no runtime data flow or user input processing is present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and mostly configuration and interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and functions from the nox_poetry package, defines two constants linked to distribution formats, and exports these via __all__. There are no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network operations. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is present. The code appears to be a standard module setup for facilitating Poetry in nox sessions.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign setup script providing constants and re-exports for nox_poetry functionalities. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
