  "purpose": "This code provides documentation and import statements for a package that facilitates using Poetry within Nox sessions, offering session decorators, helper functions, and constants related to distribution formats.",
  "sources": "Imports from nox_poetry.poetry and nox_poetry.sessions modules, as well as the defined constants and __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output operations; no data leaks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Imports and constants are straightforward; no dynamic code execution or data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code is well-structured, serves as a module definition with documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants, imports, and __all__, and includes docstrings describing functionality. It does not contain any code that reads input, executes untrusted code, or interacts with external systems. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The functions and variables appear to be standard for a package providing session management and distribution formats.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module that provides documentation and import setup for a Python package related to Poetry and Nox integration. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
