{
  "purpose": "Define a subclass of unicode representing a single character with validation.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'content' in __new__ method",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data output or untrusted data processing outside class instantiation",
  "flows": "Input 'content' flows into the Char constructor, which validates length and creates a unicode object",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple validation and subclassing without complex logic or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Char class that inherits from unicode, enforcing that the instance contains exactly one character through an assertion. It uses __new__ to create the object, which is a common pattern for immutable subclasses. The code appears straightforward with no suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic. It primarily serves as a utility class for representing single characters.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, clean, and appears to be a utility for handling single-character strings. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
