  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module interface with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The potential security concern is external, depending on how the imported functions are used downstream. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and a low security risk (~0.2) is justified due to the exposure of functions that could process untrusted data in other parts of the system."
