{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define and export components of an EDN (Extensible Data Notation) parsing and serialization library, providing functions and classes for parsing, dumping, tagging, and handling immutable data structures.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions and classes from local modules: edn_lex, edn_parse, edn_dump, exceptions, immutable_dict, immutable_list, and char.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks in this code snippet that handle untrusted data or lead to data leakage or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing modules to defining the __all__ list for exports, with no data processing or untrusted input handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are present; the code is straightforward module import and export setup with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical module interface definition for a Python library, importing specific functions and classes from local modules and defining what is publicly accessible. There are no input reading, data processing, or dynamic execution points that could be exploited. The imports are from local, presumably trusted, modules. No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or suspicious constructs are observed. The structure is standard for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard package initialization script that exports modules and functions for an EDN processing library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears safe and trustworthy.",
