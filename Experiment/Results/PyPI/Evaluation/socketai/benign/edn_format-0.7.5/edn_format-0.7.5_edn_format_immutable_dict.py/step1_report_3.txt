{
  "purpose": "Implement an immutable dictionary class for read-only or hashable use cases.",
  "sources": "Input: the constructor parameter 'somedict'; internal copy of 'somedict'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink present; no external data output or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor input into internal dict; used in __getitem__, __hash__, __eq__ methods.",
  "anomalies": "The __setitem__ method returns a new ImmutableDict instance instead of modifying in place, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an ImmutableDict class inheriting from collections.abc.Mapping, providing read-only dictionary features with an added __setitem__ method that returns a new instance with the updated item. The class includes standard methods (__getitem__, __repr__, __len__, __iter__, __hash__, __eq__) for dictionary behavior. There are no data leaks, network calls, or code injections. The __setitem__ method's design is unconventional for immutable classes but not malicious. No signs of malware or malicious activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements an immutable dictionary class with standard features and no suspicious or malicious behavior. The design choice in __setitem__ is unconventional but benign. No security risks or malware signals detected.",
