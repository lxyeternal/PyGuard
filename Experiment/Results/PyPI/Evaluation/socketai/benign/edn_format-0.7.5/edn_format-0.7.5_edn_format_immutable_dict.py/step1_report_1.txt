{
  "purpose": "Define an immutable dictionary class that mimics Python's built-in dict with read-only and hashable properties.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'somedict' in __init__ method, method calls (__getitem__, __len__, __iter__, __hash__, __eq__)",
  "sinks": "None evident; no external data output, network, or file operations present",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'somedict' into internal 'self.dict'; no external flows or untrusted data paths observed",
  "anomalies": "The __setitem__ method returns a new ImmutableDict instead of modifying in place, which is unconventional but not malicious; no secret or hardcoded credentials; no obfuscated code or suspicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code implements a read-only dictionary wrapper that prevents modification by returning a new ImmutableDict on 'set' attempts. It includes a hash method for immutability and equality checks. The code uses standard Python features and practices, with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious activity. No external network, file access, or sensitive data handling detected. The structure and logic are straightforward and aligned with typical immutable data structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an immutable dictionary with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It functions as intended for creating hashable, read-only dicts without side effects.",
