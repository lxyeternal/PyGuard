  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code implements an immutable dictionary class that mimics Python's dict, with standard methods and no external data flows.\n- The __setitem__ method returns a new instance instead of modifying in place, which is typical for immutable structures, although somewhat unconventional.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code are identified.\n- The reports assign a malware score of 0, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, aligning with the conclusion that there are no security issues.\n\n**Critical evaluation:**\n- The code is straightforward, well-understood, and uses standard Python idioms.\n- No external data leaks, network calls, or file operations are present.\n- The design choice in __setitem__ is appropriate for immutability, not malicious.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code appears safe.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Malware: 0 across all reports, justified by the lack of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated: 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- Risk: 0, as no security vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n**Final judgment:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is a standard utility class with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- Malware score: 0\n- Obfuscated score: 0\n- Risk score: 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a safe, standard implementation of an immutable dictionary class with no malicious or security issues detected.",
