  "purpose": "A utility class implementing an immutable dictionary with hashability and equality features.",
  "sources": "Input dictionary provided during initialization.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows, network, or file operations; no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionary to internal storage; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional __setitem__ method returning a new instance instead of modifying in place; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an ImmutableDict class that wraps a standard dict, providing read-only access, hashing, and equality comparison. The __setitem__ method creates and returns a new ImmutableDict with the updated key-value pair, aligning with immutable design principles. No external data flows, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward, uses standard Python idioms, and contains no obfuscation or malicious logic. The unconventional __setitem__ behavior is intentional for immutability, not malicious. Scores assigned by all reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe implementation of an immutable dictionary wrapper with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores are justified, and no further action is necessary.",
