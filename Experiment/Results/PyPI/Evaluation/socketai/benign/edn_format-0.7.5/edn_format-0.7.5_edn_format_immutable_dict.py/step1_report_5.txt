{
  "purpose": "Define an immutable dictionary class that provides read-only access to a dictionary with hashing capabilities.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'somedict' in the constructor; internal self.dict attribute.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data output or external system interaction.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'somedict' parameter into self.dict, and internal methods access self.dict for read operations.",
  "anomalies": "The __setitem__ method creates and returns a new ImmutableDict instance rather than modifying the object in place, which is consistent with immutability; no other unusual code patterns or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for an immutable dictionary with methods for item access, hashing, equality, and representation. The constructor copies the input dictionary to prevent external modifications. The __setitem__ method does not mutate but returns a new instance with the updated key-value pair, aligning with immutable design principles. No external data sources, no untrusted inputs beyond the constructor parameter, and no data leakage or malicious behavior are detected. The class appears to be a standard utility for safe, read-only dictionaries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an immutable dictionary class with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any external operations, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors.",
