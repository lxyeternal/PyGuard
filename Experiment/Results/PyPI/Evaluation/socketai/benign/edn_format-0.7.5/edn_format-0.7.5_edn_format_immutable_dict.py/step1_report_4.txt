{
  "purpose": "Defines an immutable dictionary class that mimics Python's dict but is hashable and immutable.",
  "sources": "Input data is provided via the constructor 'somedict'. No other data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external systems; the class only manipulates internal data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the constructor to internal storage, and via methods like __getitem__, __setitem__, __eq__, etc., but no external flows or outputs are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The __setitem__ method returns a new ImmutableDict instead of modifying in place, which is unconventional but not malicious. No suspicious code patterns or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an immutable dictionary class that is intended to prevent modifications. It copies input data during initialization, supports item access and equality comparison, and computes a hash for immutability. The __setitem__ method does not modify the object but returns a new instance, following immutable design principles. There are no external data flows, input validation issues, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be a straightforward utility class with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of an immutable dictionary class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and primarily serves as a data structure utility.",
