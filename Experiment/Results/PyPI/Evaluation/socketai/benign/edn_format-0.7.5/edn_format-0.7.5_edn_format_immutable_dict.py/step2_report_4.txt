  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code implements an immutable dictionary class (`ImmutableDict`) that wraps a standard dict, providing read-only access and hashability.\n- The `__setitem__` method returns a new instance with the updated key-value pair, which is consistent with immutable data structures.\n- No external data flows, network activity, or suspicious behavior are evident.\n- The code appears straightforward, using standard Python practices.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the description: an immutable, hashable dictionary wrapper.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or security risks.\n- The `__setitem__` method's behavior is unconventional but aligns with immutable design principles; no security concern there.\n- No external data, network, or file operations are present.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The reports are consistent: no logical errors or security flaws are identified.\n- The `__setitem__` method returns a new instance rather than modifying in place, which is typical for immutable classes, though it might be unexpected for some users. But this is not an error, just a design choice.\n- No issues with the code's correctness or security.\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** 0, as no vulnerabilities or malicious activities are detected.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- All reports assign a risk score of 0 or 0.9/1.0 with high confidence, but since the code is benign, a risk score of 0.5 or higher is unwarranted.\n- The highest confidence is in the reports (confidence 1 or 0.9), and they correctly identify no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard utility class for immutable dictionaries, with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious activity or security risks. No changes to scores are necessary.",
