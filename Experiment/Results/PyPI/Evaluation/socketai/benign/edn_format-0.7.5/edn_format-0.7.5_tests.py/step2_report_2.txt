  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code is a test suite with static, hardcoded EDN strings. No external or untrusted sources are involved.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Only internal assertions and parsing/serialization functions with controlled data. No external data flow or system effects.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious or malicious code; only testing library behavior. No code injection, network, or file operations.\n- **Conclusion:** Completely safe, standard testing code with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware score = 0; Obfuscated = 0; Security risk = 0.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, uses static EDN strings for testing.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data sources; only internal parsing and assertions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no suspicious patterns. Focused on correctness.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate test suite.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0; Obfuscated = 0; Security risk = 0.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern—test data is hardcoded, no external input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data flows; only internal parsing/serialization.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. Tests are comprehensive but benign.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure, non-malicious testing code.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0; Obfuscated = 0; Security risk = 0.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Testing with static EDN strings; no external input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or untrusted data flows; only test assertions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, no malicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard testing code.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0; Obfuscated = 0; Security risk = 0.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as others—static test data, no external input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data flows; only internal parsing/serialization.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no code injection.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe test suite.\n- **Scores Justification:** Malware = 0; Obfuscated = 0; Security risk = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious behavior, no obfuscation, no malicious code, no external data flows that could be exploited.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation patterns or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- **Risk Score:** The entire code is a controlled test suite, with no external dependencies or runtime data that could lead to security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** **0** (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** (no obfuscation or hidden code)\n- **Risk Score:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, well-structured unit testing suite for the 'edn_format' library, with no indications of malicious intent, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. It is safe for deployment and review.",
