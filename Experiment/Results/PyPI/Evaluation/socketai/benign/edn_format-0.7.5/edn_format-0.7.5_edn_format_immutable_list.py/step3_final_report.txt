{
  "purpose": "Provides an immutable list wrapper that ensures list data cannot be modified after creation, supporting read-only operations and returning new instances for mutator methods.",
  "sources": "Input wrapped_list during initialization, method calls like insert and sort that create new list instances.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data flows are internal within the class, with no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the wrapped_list; methods like insert and sort generate new list instances, which are encapsulated in new ImmutableList objects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward, uses standard library functions, and maintains immutability.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an ImmutableList class that wraps a list, providing read-only access and methods that return new instances with modifications. It uses standard library modules, handles copying appropriately, and does not perform any external data operations or network activity. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or security vulnerabilities are present. The methods are implemented in a typical manner for immutable data structures, and the class is a benign utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility implementing an immutable list wrapper with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its safety. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The slight overestimation of risk in some reports (e.g., 0.1) can be adjusted to 0 for accuracy.",
