{
  "purpose": "Implement an immutable list wrapper class that provides read-only access and some list operations.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the constructor parameter 'wrapped_list', which is converted into a list; no other external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write data to external systems, network, or files.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'wrapped_list' into the internal '_list'. List operations create modified copies but do not lead to external data leaks or system actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Use of standard libraries and straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an ImmutableList class that wraps a list to make it immutable. It provides methods for representation, equality, hashing, and list operations like insert and sort. The class ensures that modifications create new instances, maintaining immutability. No network, file, or environment interactions are present. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The code appears to be a benign utility class with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility implementation for an immutable list wrapper. There is no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It is safe from a security perspective.",
