{
  "purpose": "Implement an immutable list wrapper that provides read-only list-like behavior with optional copying and additional list operations.",
  "sources": "The class receives data through the constructor parameter 'wrapped_list'. It reads methods like __repr__, __eq__, __getitem__, __len__, and internally calls list methods such as 'insert' and 'sort'.",
  "sinks": "The main data flow occurs in the _call_wrapped_list_method function, which calls list methods that modify the list. No untrusted external data sources or network calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data is input via the constructor; 'wrapped_list' is stored internally. Methods like 'insert' and 'sort' call _call_wrapped_list_method, which copies and modifies the list, returning a new ImmutableList instance.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code strictly wraps list operations without executing external or untrusted code. No obfuscated or malicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an immutable list class that encapsulates a list and provides read-only access with controlled modifications. It uses safe copying and standard list operations. There are no indications of malicious intent, data exfiltration, or harmful behaviors. The implementation appears to be a utility for safe data handling without external communication or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, safe implementation of an immutable list wrapper. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
