{
  "purpose": "This code defines an immutable list class that wraps a standard list, providing read-only access and some list operations while ensuring immutability.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'wrapped_list' parameter during instantiation. It also imports modules and handles attributes internally.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only manipulates internal list data and provides read-only methods.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from 'wrapped_list' into internal '_list'. Method calls like 'insert' and 'sort' create copies and modify them internally without exposing unsafe operations externally.",
  "anomalies": "The class provides list mutator methods ('insert', 'sort') that return new ImmutableList instances; this is not malicious but noteworthy. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious external calls are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions with no obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an 'ImmutableList' class that wraps a list to make it immutable, providing read-only access and methods to create modified copies. It uses standard Python modules and practices, with no external network calls, data leaks, or malicious patterns observed. All functions and attributes are typical for such a utility class. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected; the class is designed for safe, immutable list handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for creating immutable list objects. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The class implementation is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices.",
