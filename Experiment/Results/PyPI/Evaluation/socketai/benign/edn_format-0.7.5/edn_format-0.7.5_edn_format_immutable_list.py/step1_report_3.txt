{
  "purpose": "Defines an immutable list class that wraps around a Python list, providing read-only and hashable behavior with some list operations like insert and sort.",
  "sources": "Input data source is the wrapped_list parameter during initialization.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code does not perform any data output, network communication, or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input wrapped_list -> stored internally; method calls (insert, sort) create new ImmutableList instances with modified lists.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. The class provides list immutability and hashability, typical for utility classes.",
  "analysis": "The code creates an ImmutableList class, which is a read-only, hashable wrapper for lists. It supports common list operations by copying and returning new ImmutableList instances, maintaining immutability. No external data is fetched or sent; no environment variables are accessed; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present. The code appears to be a standard utility for immutable list handling without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility class implementing immutable list behavior. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
