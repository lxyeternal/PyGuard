  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured utility implementing an immutable list wrapper with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly identify its safety. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The slight overestimation of risk in some reports (e.g., 0.1) can be adjusted to 0 for accuracy."
