{
  "purpose": "The code defines an immutable wrapper around a list, providing read-only list functionality with some list modification methods that return new instances.",
  "sources": "Input source is the 'wrapped_list' parameter in the constructor, which is used to initialize the internal list.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any data leaks, network operations, or use of untrusted inputs in a harmful way. No sinks are present that could lead to malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Input data (wrapped_list) is stored internally; methods like insert and sort create copies, but do not process untrusted data directly. No flow from untrusted source to sensitive sink is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or unusual language features. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code provides an immutable list wrapper with methods for list operations that produce new instances. It handles list copying properly to prevent external modifications. No external network calls, data leaks, or dangerous behaviors are found. The code is well-structured, follows standard practices, and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign implementation of an immutable list wrapper. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use in applications requiring read-only list behavior.",
