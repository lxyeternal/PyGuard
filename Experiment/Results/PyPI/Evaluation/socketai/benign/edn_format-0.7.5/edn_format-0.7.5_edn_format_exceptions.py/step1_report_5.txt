  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class EDNDecodeError for handling specific decoding errors related to EDN data.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow since no input or processing logic is present.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual to see only a class definition with no further logic; the code appears incomplete or minimal. No malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then defines a subclass of ValueError named EDNDecodeError. It serves as a custom exception. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The minimal nature suggests it is part of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple class definition for a custom exception, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and straightforward.",
