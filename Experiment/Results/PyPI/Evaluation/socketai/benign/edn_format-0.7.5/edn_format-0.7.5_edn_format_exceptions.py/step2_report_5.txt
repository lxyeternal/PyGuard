  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the original code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code only imports future features for compatibility.\n   - It defines a single custom exception class `EDNDecodeError` inheriting from `ValueError`.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data processing, or dynamic behaviors.\n   - The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Obfuscation**:\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns.\n   - No external data handling, network communication, or code execution.\n   - The class is likely part of a larger module for EDN decoding, serving as a specific error type.\n\n3. **Analysis of Each Report**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or security risks are identified.\n   - The confidence levels are all at 1, indicating certainty about benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n   - Malware scores are 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, aligning with the code's simplicity.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware**: All reports correctly assign a score of 0, as there is no malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's clarity.\n   - **Risk**: Since the code is a simple class definition with no external effects, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n5. **Potential for Adjustment**:\n   - Given the unanimity and clarity, no score adjustments are necessary.\n   - The scores align with the code's characteristics.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a benign, standard class definition for a custom exception.\n   - No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Final Recommendations**:\n- The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate.\n- No further action needed; the code is safe.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0\n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus of the reports.",
