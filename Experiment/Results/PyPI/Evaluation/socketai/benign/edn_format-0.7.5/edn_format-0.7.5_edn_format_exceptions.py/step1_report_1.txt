{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom exception class EDNDecodeError for handling specific decoding errors related to EDN format.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code does not read or accept external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only defines a class without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, minimal, and standard in structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then defines a custom exception class that inherits from ValueError. It does not contain any input handling, data processing, or external communication. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are present. The class appears to be part of a larger module for EDN decoding, providing a specific error type for that context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign class definition with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated components. It is standard and safe.",
