  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception (`EDNDecodeError`) inheriting from `ValueError`. There are no input/output operations, data processing, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly note the absence of data flow, input/output, or suspicious patterns. No logical errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - Confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n   - Obfuscated: 0\n   - Malware: 0\n   - Security Risk: 0\n\n   These scores seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is a simple exception class with no data handling, no external communication, and no obfuscation, the security risk and malware scores should remain at 0. The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. There is no malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is minimal, standard, and benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, with no security concerns.**  \nIt appears to be a minimal, standard class definition for a custom exception, likely part of a larger codebase for EDN decoding.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nI agree with the reports' assessments. No changes are necessary. The code is safe and non-malicious.",
