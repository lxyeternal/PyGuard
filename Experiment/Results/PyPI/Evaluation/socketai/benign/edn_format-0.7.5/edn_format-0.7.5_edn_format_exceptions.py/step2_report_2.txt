  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the code accordingly.\n\n**Code Overview:**\nThe provided code is a minimal class definition:\n```python\n# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-\nfrom __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function, unicode_literals\n\nclass EDNDecodeError(ValueError):\n    pass\n```\nIt defines a custom exception class inheriting from `ValueError`, with no additional logic or data handling.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.  \n- They correctly identify that the code only defines a class, with no data input/output, data flow, or suspicious patterns.  \n- No flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n---\n\n### Score Analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code contains no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and standard.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n### Potential Adjustments:\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable. No score adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate. They correctly identify that this is a benign, minimal class definition with no security implications.\n- The high confidence scores (mostly 1) are justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code snippet is entirely benign, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and well-reasoned. The code is a standard, harmless class definition, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- Maintain the current scores.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Note:** Always consider the broader context if this code is part of a larger codebase, but based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
