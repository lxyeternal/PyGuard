  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and analyze the provided code and the reasoning behind the security assessments.\n\n1. **Code content confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward class definition:\n     ```python\n     class EDNDecodeError(ValueError):\n         pass\n     ```\n   - It imports future features for compatibility, which is standard practice.\n   - No input/output, data processing, or external communication is present.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or complex logic.\n\n2. **Analysis of each report:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, simple, and standard.\n   - They correctly identify that there are no data flows, no input/output, and no suspicious patterns.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which seems appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n3. **Scores and justifications:**\n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code defines only a custom exception class with no malicious intent.\n   - **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is justified since the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Security risk score:** All assign 0, which is accurate given the absence of any security-sensitive operations.\n\n4. **Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n   - The reports are consistent with the code content.\n   - The scores seem reasonable and aligned with the analysis.\n   - No need to increase scores for malware or obfuscation.\n\n5. **Additional considerations:**\n   - The code is minimal and appears to be part of a larger codebase for EDN decoding.\n   - The purpose is solely to define a custom exception class, which is common practice.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, I agree with the reports' conclusions and scores.** The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threat.",
