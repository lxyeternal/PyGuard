  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the scoring and reasoning.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code**\n\n- The code is a minimal class definition: it imports future features for compatibility and defines a custom exception class `EDNDecodeError` inheriting from `ValueError`.\n- There are no input/output, data processing, or external interactions.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or anomalies.\n\n**Step 2: Review the logical reasoning and conclusions**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n- The analysis correctly notes the absence of data flow, sources, sinks, or anomalies.\n- No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are identified.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the scores assigned**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - confidence: 1 (full confidence)\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - malware: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0\n\n- These scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk and malware scores**\n\n- Since the code is purely a class definition with no data handling, no external communication, and no obfuscation, the malware score should be 0.\n- The risk score should also be 0, as there is no security threat or vulnerability.\n\n**Step 5: Check for any assumptions or claims about vulnerabilities**\n\n- All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities, focusing instead on the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**Step 6: Final assessment**\n\n- The code is a simple, harmless class definition.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n- Scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### **Overall Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence from the code snippet and reports.",
