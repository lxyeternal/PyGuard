  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for EDN decoding errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources; class definition is static.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output; class serves as an error type.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class is a simple inheritance without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard, and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility and defines a single custom exception class inheriting from ValueError. It contains no data handling, external communication, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard class definition with no security threats, malware, or obfuscation. The current scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
