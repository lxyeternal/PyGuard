  "purpose": "The code defines a custom exception class EDNDecodeError for handling specific decoding errors related to EDN data format.",
  "sources": "The code does not read any input or data; it solely defines a class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present, as the code does not process data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; this is just a class definition without executable data flow.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies or suspicious code patterns; the use of future imports is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then defines a simple custom exception class inheriting from ValueError. It does not contain any data processing, input/output, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign code snippet that defines a custom exception. No malicious intent or security risk is evident.",
