  "purpose": "Define the setup configuration for the 'edn_format' Python package, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' file; reading 'README.md' file.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no network, file, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input from 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md' files used to configure package setup.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. No code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import setup from setuptools, falling back to distutils if unavailable. It reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and a long description from 'README.md'. The setup() call constructs package metadata and configuration, which is standard practice. No suspicious behaviors, malicious code, or security risks are detected in this straightforward setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
