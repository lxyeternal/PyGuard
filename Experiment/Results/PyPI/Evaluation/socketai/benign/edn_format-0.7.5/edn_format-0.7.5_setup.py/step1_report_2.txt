{
  "purpose": "The code defines the setup configuration for packaging the 'edn_format' Python library, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reading 'README.md' for long description",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; setup functions are standard and do not execute untrusted code",
  "flows": "Reading requirements and README files, then passing data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard setup script with proper handling of missing modules and reading files",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import setup from setuptools, falling back to distutils if necessary. It reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and the long description from 'README.md'. The setup() function is used to define package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. All operations are typical for a Python package setup script. No code injection, malicious code, or suspicious behavior is evident. The files read are standard documentation and dependency lists, with no user input involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It only reads static files and invokes setup() with defined parameters.",
