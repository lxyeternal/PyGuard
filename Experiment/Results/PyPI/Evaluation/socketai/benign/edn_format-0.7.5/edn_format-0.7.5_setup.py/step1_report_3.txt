  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the 'edn_format' Python module, defining its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data is written or executed.",
  "flows": "Input from 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md' files is used in setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code follows standard setup.py practices, no suspicious variables or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import setup from setuptools, falling back to distutils if unavailable, which is standard. It reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and the long description from 'README.md'. These are then used to configure package setup parameters. The code does not include any dynamic code execution, code injection, or hidden behaviors. All file reads are straightforward and typical for Python package setup scripts. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are present. The code structure and comments are consistent with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
