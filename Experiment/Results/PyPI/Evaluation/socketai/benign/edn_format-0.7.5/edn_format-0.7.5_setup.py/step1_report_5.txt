{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging and distributing a Python project called 'edn_format'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'requirements.txt' file for dependencies and the 'README.md' file for a long description.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is used to perform sensitive actions or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input from 'requirements.txt' and 'README.md' files flow into package setup parameters, but these are static file reads with no untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code follows standard Python packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script attempts to import 'setuptools' for packaging; if unavailable, it falls back to 'distutils'. It reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and the long description from 'README.md'. The setup() function is called with package metadata and configuration, with no dynamic code execution or untrusted data handling. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are observed. The code is straightforward, typical of open-source Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no indications of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code.",
