  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code, which is a standard Python setup script.\n- The code reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and long description from 'README.md'.\n- It conditionally imports 'setuptools' or 'distutils' and calls 'setup()' with package metadata.\n- No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or data flows are identified.\n- All reports conclude that the script is benign and standard.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify that the code is a typical setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors?**  \n  None. The analysis is consistent and accurate.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the script.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is correct since there's no obfuscation.\n\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- Since the code is straightforward, static, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, higher scores are unjustified.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume that reading static files ('requirements.txt' and 'README.md') and calling 'setup()' is inherently safe, which is correct.\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities like code injection or dynamic execution, which is appropriate.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven all the information, I agree with the reports' conclusions and scores.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent, no obfuscation, and no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that appropriately. No changes are necessary.",
