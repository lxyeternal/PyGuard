  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'edn_format', configuring package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads 'requirements.txt' for dependencies and 'README.md' for long description; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or system modifications beyond standard setup.",
  "flows": "Static data from files flows into setup() parameters; no dynamic or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, static setup script that conditionally imports 'setuptools', reads dependencies and description from static files, and calls 'setup()' with package info. No dynamic execution, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The code adheres to common packaging practices, and no anomalies or security issues are evident. The external files are static and standard, posing minimal risk. All indicators point to benign, well-structured code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package configuration with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores of malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, and securityRisk: 0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. The code poses no threat and can be considered safe.",
