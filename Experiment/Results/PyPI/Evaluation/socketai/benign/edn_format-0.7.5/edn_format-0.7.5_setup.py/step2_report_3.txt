  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports describe the code as a standard setup.py script for the 'edn_format' Python package.\n- They uniformly state that the code reads static files ('requirements.txt' and 'README.md'), performs no dynamic or untrusted code execution, and contains no anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The purpose, sources, sinks, flows, and conclusions are consistent across reports, with a confidence level of 1.\n\n**Code Confirmations:**\n- The code snippet matches the described setup script.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors are present.\n- The code performs typical operations: conditional import, reading files, calling setup().\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:**\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python packaging practices.\n- No issues with the logic, file handling, or potential injection points.\n\n**Scores and Justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious actions—no network calls, code injection, or external data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, justified given the benign nature of the script.\n\n**Potential Discrepancies or Concerns:**\n- The reports are consistent and thorough. There are no assumptions about vulnerabilities that are unfounded.\n- Since the code is static, does not process untrusted input, and is a common setup script, the risk scores are appropriate.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n- The scores are reasonable and aligned with the code's behavior.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**My Final Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe setup script is a typical, safe package configuration with no security concerns. The detailed reviews support this conclusion.",
