  "purpose": "Set up configuration for Python package 'edn_format', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data is used in sensitive operations or external communications.",
  "flows": "Reading requirements from 'requirements.txt' and description from 'README.md' during setup; no data flows leading to external system effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup routine for a Python package. It conditionally imports 'setuptools' or 'distutils', reads dependencies and long description files, and calls 'setup' with package metadata. There are no network calls, dynamic code execution, or suspicious logic. All operations are typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward setup configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is a benign package metadata script.",
