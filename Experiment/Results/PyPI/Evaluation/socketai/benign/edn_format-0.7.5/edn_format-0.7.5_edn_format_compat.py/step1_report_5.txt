{
  "purpose": "This code provides compatibility shims for supporting different Python versions (2 and 3) by defining type aliases and functions for string and integer types.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version information from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points are present; the code does not process or handle untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The flow involves reading the Python version info to define compatible types, with no data passing to other parts.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors; this is standard compatibility code.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python version at runtime and defines type aliases accordingly, ensuring compatibility between Python 2 and 3. It uses sys.version_info for version detection and conditionally assigns or defines types and functions to abstract differences in string and integer handling. No external input, untrusted data, or malicious behavior is evident. The code structure is straightforward and typical for cross-version compatibility modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply sets up type aliases to support code that runs on multiple Python versions.",
