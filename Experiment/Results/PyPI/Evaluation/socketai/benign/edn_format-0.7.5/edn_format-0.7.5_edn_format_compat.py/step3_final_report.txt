  "purpose": "Provides compatibility support for Python 2 and 3 by defining type aliases and a bytes conversion function.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info[0] for version check",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external data handling",
  "flows": "None; code only sets up aliases based on version",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward compatibility code with no suspicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python major version and defines type aliases and a _bytes function accordingly. It does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as standard compatibility code with no malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard compatibility utility with no security risks or malicious behavior. The code is clear, straightforward, and safe.",
