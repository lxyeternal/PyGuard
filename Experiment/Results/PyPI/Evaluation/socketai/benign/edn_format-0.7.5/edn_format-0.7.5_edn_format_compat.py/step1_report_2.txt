  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code detected; code is standard version compatibility handling",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python version and sets type aliases for 'long', 'basestring', 'unicode', and 'unichr' accordingly. It also defines a '_bytes' function for encoding strings to bytes in Python 3. These are common compatibility patterns. No data input, network operations, or untrusted data handling are present. The code does not include any obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard compatibility shim for Python 2/3 and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
