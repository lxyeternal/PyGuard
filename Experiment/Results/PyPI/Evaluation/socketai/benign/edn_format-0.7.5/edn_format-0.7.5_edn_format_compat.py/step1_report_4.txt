  "purpose": "Define compatibility aliases for Python 2 and Python 3 differences in string and type handling.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info to check Python version; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of version checks and type aliasing are standard practices for compatibility; no unusual or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical compatibility shim to unify type names and functions across Python versions. It uses sys.version_info to determine Python version and sets type aliases accordingly. No external data, no code injection, no backdoors, and no malicious behavior are evident. The code's structure and content are straightforward and typical for maintaining cross-version compatibility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility layer for Python 2 and 3 with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
