  "anomalies": "Use of compatibility layer is standard; no suspicious or unusual code detected",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version and defines type aliases and a bytes function accordingly. It is a common pattern for maintaining compatibility between Python 2 and 3. No input handling, data processing, or external data sources are involved. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical compatibility utility without malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
