  "sinks": "No sinks; no data is sent or written.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; just variable assignments and function definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard compatibility code.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python version to set compatibility aliases for types like long, basestring, unicode, and unichr, and defines a helper _bytes function. This is common in code intended to support both Python 2 and 3. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity is present. The code only sets up type compatibility and does not perform any data processing or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard compatibility shim for supporting both Python 2 and 3. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
