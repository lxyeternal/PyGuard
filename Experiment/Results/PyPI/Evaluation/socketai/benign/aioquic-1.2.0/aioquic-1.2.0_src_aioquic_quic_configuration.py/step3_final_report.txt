  "purpose": "Load TLS certificates and private keys from files for secure communication setup.",
  "sources": "Reading certificate and key files from disk, splitting PEM files using boundary strings.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is directly processed into sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "File read -> split PEM content -> load certificates and keys into memory.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional use of boundary splitting for PEM parsing; no obfuscation or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard TLS certificate and key loading procedures, utilizing external cryptography libraries. The boundary splitting approach for PEM parsing is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The security and malware scores are consistent with benign, standard cryptographic setup. No network activity or dynamic code execution is involved. The handling of sensitive files is typical, with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard TLS certificate and key loader with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The low malware and risk scores are justified, and the code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
