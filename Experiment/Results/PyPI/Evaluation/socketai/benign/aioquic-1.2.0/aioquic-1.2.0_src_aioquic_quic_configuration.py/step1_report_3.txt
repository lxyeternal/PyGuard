  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class for a QUIC protocol implementation, including TLS certificate loading and verification setup.",
  "sources": "File reads in load_cert_chain method (certfile and optional keyfile).",
  "sinks": "Potentially loads private keys and certificates into internal variables; no direct data leaks or external transmissions observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file inputs into load_pem_x509_certificates and load_pem_private_key functions; then into class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Uses string boundary splitting to parse PEM certificates and private keys; no malicious patterns detected in parsing logic. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious variables.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles loading certificates and private keys from files, which is standard for TLS setup. It reads certificate and key files, parses PEM data, and assigns them internally. No network transmissions or suspicious data handling is present. The use of boundary splitting for PEM parsing is standard, and no obfuscation or suspicious code constructs are evident. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. Functions are focused solely on TLS configuration and certificate management.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a typical TLS setup component handling certificate and key loading. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. No anomalies or malicious code detected. It appears to be a benign, purpose-driven implementation.",
