  "purpose": "Defines a configuration class for QUIC protocol settings, including TLS certificate loading methods.",
  "sources": "File reads in 'load_cert_chain' method, reading certificate and key files.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file input to cryptographic load functions within 'load_cert_chain'.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The 'load_cert_chain' method reads and processes certificate data, but does so using standard cryptographic library calls without malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or secret leaks evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass for QUIC configuration, including TLS settings. The 'load_cert_chain' method reads certificate and key files, parses certificates, and loads private keys using cryptography libraries. The method properly handles the reading of PEM files and assigns cryptographic objects to class attributes. The 'load_verify_locations' method sets trusted CA locations. All operations are standard for TLS configuration and involve no suspicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code. No network communication, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution is present. No obfuscation or hidden malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, well-structured configuration class for QUIC and TLS, with standard file reading and cryptography library use. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this code fragment.",
