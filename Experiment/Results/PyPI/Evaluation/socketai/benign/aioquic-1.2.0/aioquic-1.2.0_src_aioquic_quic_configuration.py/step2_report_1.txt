  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily responsible for loading TLS certificates and private keys from files, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- The use of boundary splitting on PEM files is somewhat unconventional but not inherently malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected.\n- The code relies on external cryptography libraries, which are presumed safe.\n- The security risk scores assigned are low (around 0.1 to 0.2), and malware scores are zero.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The code loads TLS certificates and keys from files, which is standard. No malicious or suspicious issues are evident.\n\n- **Are the errors, flaws, or mistakes identified?**  \n  No. The splitting of PEM files using boundary strings is slightly unusual but not problematic.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis. The security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's functionality.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is consistent; no obfuscation is present.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  The scores are around 0.1–0.2, indicating minimal risk. This seems reasonable since the code handles sensitive cryptographic material but does so in a standard, controlled manner.\n\n- **Logic and reasoning:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code performs standard TLS certificate loading with no malicious intent.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**  \n  No assumptions are made about malicious behavior. The code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Final evaluation:\n\nGiven all the reports and the code:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1–0.2** — minimal operational risk, primarily related to handling sensitive files.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.15 (a conservative average considering file handling of sensitive data, but no actual malicious activity)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard TLS certificate and key loader with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk score is justified, and the absence of malware is confirmed.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nNo further action needed. The code appears safe and benign, serving its purpose of TLS configuration within a QUIC setup.",
