  "purpose": "The code is missing or contains no executable content; no specific purpose can be determined.",
  "sources": "No data sources or input points are present due to missing code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points are identifiable without code.",
  "flows": "No data flows can be established without source or sink points.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code; no anomalies or suspicious patterns can be detected.",
  "analysis": "Given the complete lack of code, analysis is limited to noting the absence of any executable or data processing logic. No sources, sinks, or flows exist, and no anomalies are present. The reports correctly identify the missing code and refrain from making unwarranted assumptions. Scores assigned are zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk, which aligns with the absence of evidence. Confidence is high in the conclusion that no malicious activity can be inferred from missing code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is absent; therefore, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the available information.",
