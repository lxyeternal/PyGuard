  "purpose": "Implements an HTTP/0.9 protocol handler over QUIC, managing stream data, headers, and data transmission.",
  "sources": "Stream data received (StreamDataReceived events), headers provided via send_headers method.",
  "sinks": "Calls to self._quic.send_stream_data for sending data and headers.",
  "flows": "Input stream data → buffer or parse headers → generate events → send data or headers via send_stream_data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a straightforward HTTP/0.9 handler over QUIC, buffering incomplete requests, parsing headers, and sending data. It uses standard practices without any signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No external data leaks or malicious payloads are evident. The logic is clear, and the security implications are minimal, primarily involving standard network data handling. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an HTTP/0.9 protocol handler over QUIC. No malicious or suspicious activity is present. The security risk is minimal, and the code does not exhibit obfuscation or malware. The reports' assessments are accurate and align with the analysis.",
