{
  "purpose": "Implements an HTTP/0.9 connection handler over QUIC, managing data and headers for streams.",
  "sources": "Reads data from QuicEvent (StreamDataReceived), headers from Headers (not explicitly used), and internal buffer for incomplete requests.",
  "sinks": "Sends stream data via self._quic.send_stream_data, which could potentially be misused if data is maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Receives StreamDataReceived, processes headers or data, stores incomplete data, and sends data or headers over QUIC streams.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. No external network connections or data exfiltration observed. Usage of stream buffers and conditional header processing appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code processes QUIC stream events, manages internal buffers for partial data, distinguishes between client and server roles, and handles data and headers accordingly. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The handling of headers and data is straightforward and typical for an HTTP/0.9 over QUIC implementation. No obfuscated code, suspicious variable names, or unusual code patterns were detected. The code appears to perform expected protocol handling with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an HTTP/0.9 connection over QUIC. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It primarily manages stream data and headers in a typical manner without any signs of sabotage or malware.",
