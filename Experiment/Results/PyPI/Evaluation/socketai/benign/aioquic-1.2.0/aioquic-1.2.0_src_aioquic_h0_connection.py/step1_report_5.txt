  "purpose": "Implement an HTTP/0.9 connection handler for QUIC streams, managing headers and data transfer",
  "sources": "Reads stream data from QuicEvent (StreamDataReceived), reads headers from provided headers parameter",
  "sinks": "Calls to self._quic.send_stream_data to send data and headers over the QUIC connection",
  "flows": "Input stream data (StreamDataReceived) -> buffer and header processing -> send_stream_data calls",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscation or suspicious network behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code manages HTTP/0.9 over QUIC streams by buffering incoming data, parsing headers, and sending data/headers. It correctly distinguishes between client and server roles. It handles stream data, reconstructs requests, and sends data accordingly. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or network anomalies. The code appears to be a standard implementation of a protocol handler, with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate protocol handler for HTTP/0.9 over QUIC without any malicious behavior or security risks detected. It handles stream data appropriately and does not contain suspicious anomalies.",
