  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the technical details, potential indicators of malicious activity, and the consistency of scores with the content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Flows:** Implements TLS 1.3 handshake, message parsing, cryptography, session management, both client and server.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, no backdoors, no obfuscation, standard cryptography, environment variables used appropriately.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate TLS 1.3 implementation, following RFC standards, with no malicious behavior or sabotage detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (consistent)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (consistent)  \n- Risk: 0.1 (low, given the complexity but no malicious intent)\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment aligns with the code content. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Flows:** Similar TLS 1.3 implementation, including handshake, certificate validation, key exchange.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, uses cryptography libraries correctly.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate TLS code, no malicious activity, standard practices, no signs of sabotage.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2 (still low, given the detailed implementation)\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Flows:** Standard TLS handshake, cryptography, certificate validation, session management.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, uses cryptography libraries properly.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate TLS protocol implementation, no malicious or sabotage behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Flows:** TLS protocol, including message parsing, cryptography, session management.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, no malicious code, cryptography handled via standard libraries.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Well-structured TLS implementation, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Scores match the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Flows:** TLS message handling, cryptography, certificate validation, session management.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no network connections to malicious domains, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard TLS protocol code, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with the code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports give 0, which aligns with the detailed analysis indicating no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the code's clarity and standard structure.\n- **Risk Score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2, reflecting low security risk, which is appropriate given the complex but standard TLS implementation.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (low, due to complexity but no malicious intent)\n\n**My personal estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.15 (a balanced view considering the complexity but no suspicious activity)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code being a legitimate, standard TLS 1.3 implementation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the provided details.",
