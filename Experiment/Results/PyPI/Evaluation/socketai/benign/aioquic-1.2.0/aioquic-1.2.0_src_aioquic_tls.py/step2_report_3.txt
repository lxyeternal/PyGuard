  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the code's behavior, cryptographic correctness, and potential malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements TLS 1.3, including message parsing, cryptography, session management, and handshake procedures for both client and server roles.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation. Cryptography follows RFC standards, environment variables are used for configuration, which is typical.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a standard TLS implementation with no malicious behavior. The confidence level is high (0.9), and the malware score is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues detected; the code appears legitimate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on TLS 1.3 handshake, cryptography, and certificate validation.\n- **Findings:** No signs of backdoors, suspicious code, or obfuscation. External libraries are used appropriately.\n- **Assessment:** The code's behavior aligns with standard TLS protocols, with no malicious indicators. Malware score remains 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate TLS implementation, no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a TLS 1.3 protocol handler with message parsing, cryptography, and session management.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Uses cryptography libraries properly.\n- **Assessment:** The code is consistent with standard TLS practices, with no signs of sabotage or malware.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate TLS code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Implements TLS protocol, including certificate validation, handshake, cryptography, and session management.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious activity. Uses cryptography libraries correctly.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears to be a standard, secure TLS implementation.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on TLS message parsing, cryptography, and certificate validation.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. Uses cryptography securely.\n- **Assessment:** The code is consistent with standard TLS protocol implementations.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious code. The cryptography is standard, and no malicious network behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are observed across reports.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the thorough implementation and absence of malicious indicators, the overall security risk remains very low.\n\n### My Reasoned Final Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — No evidence of malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — No obfuscation or suspicious code patterns.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Slightly above zero due to the complexity of TLS, but overall very low risk.\n\n### Justification:\n\n- The code implements standard TLS 1.3 protocol logic, including cryptographic operations, certificate validation, and session management, all using well-established libraries.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation is detected.\n- The detailed analysis from multiple reports supports that this is a legitimate, secure TLS implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code appears to be a legitimate, secure TLS 1.3 implementation with no malicious or obfuscated components. The scores should reflect this high confidence.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| **0.0**        | **0.0**           | **0.1**    |\n\nPlease let me know if further detailed review or specific focus areas are needed.",
