  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static, straightforward, and intended solely for documentation purposes.\n- No untrusted data inputs, network activity, or external data sinks are present.\n- No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code uses standard docutils and Sphinx extension mechanisms.\n\n**Scores evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The code does not perform any operations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.\n- The static content and registration process do not introduce security risks.\n- No evidence of malicious intent, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n\n**Potential issues or considerations:**\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; no changes needed.\n- The only minor note: if in the future, the directive were to process untrusted input, that would warrant a higher risk score. But currently, it's purely static.\n\n**Final conclusion:**\n\n- **Your estimates for malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should all be 0.**  \n- The code is safe, benign, and serves a documentation purpose only.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Score |\n|------------------|-------------------|\n| Malware          | 0                 |\n| Obfuscated       | 0                 |\n| Security Risk    | 0                 |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consensus in the reports.",
