  "purpose": "Provides functions to encode and determine the size of a QUIC protocol's variable-length unsigned integer.",
  "sources": "Input integer values for encoding and size calculation functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; encoding functions process input values and output bytes.",
  "flows": "Input value -> size check and validation -> Buffer.push_uint_var -> output bytes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a local Buffer class without its implementation; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard QUIC variable-length integer encoding with proper boundary checks and exception handling. No network, file, or environment interactions are present. The use of a local Buffer class warrants further review if its implementation is malicious, but no evidence suggests malicious intent. The functions follow protocol specifications and perform straightforward operations. All reports assign a malware score of 0 and low security risk scores, consistent with the code's purpose. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, protocol-compliant implementation of variable-length integer encoding for QUIC, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of a local Buffer class is noted but not suspicious without its implementation. Overall, the code is safe and correctly implemented.",
