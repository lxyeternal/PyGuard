  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, protocol-compliant implementation of variable-length integer encoding for QUIC, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The use of a local Buffer class is noted but not suspicious without its implementation. Overall, the code is safe and correctly implemented."
