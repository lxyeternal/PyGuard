{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to encode and determine the size of a QUIC protocol's variable-length unsigned integer.",
  "sources": "Input data is received via the 'value' parameter in encode_uint_var and size_uint_var functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions do not write data to external locations or perform any I/O beyond returning encoded bytes or size.",
  "flows": "Input 'value' is checked for bounds and then encoded into bytes; no external data flow or untrusted external interactions are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a custom Buffer class without revealing its implementation, but this alone is not suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behavior detected. The maximum integer size is consistent with protocol specifications.",
  "analysis": "The functions encode_uint_var and size_uint_var handle encoding of variable-length integers following QUIC standards. The maximum value constants align with protocol specifications. No obfuscated code, suspicious dynamic execution, or hardcoded secrets are present. The Buffer class is imported from a local module, but this is standard practice. No network, file, or environment interactions are observed. The code appears straightforward, focusing on encoding logic, with appropriate input validation and boundary checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard encoding and size calculation for QUIC protocol integers with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and purpose-driven, with no evident security risks.",
