  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code:\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\n__version__ = \"1.2.0\"\n```\n\n**Review of Reports:**\n\n1. **Purpose & Content:** All reports agree that the code simply assigns a version string to `__version__`. No input/output, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n\n2. **Errors or Flaws in Reports:**  \n   - All reports are consistent in their assessment; they correctly identify that this is a standard version declaration.  \n   - No errors or logical flaws are apparent in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores & Justifications:**  \n   - **Obfuscated Score (0):** Correct, as the code is straightforward and unobfuscated.  \n   - **Malware Score (0):** Correct, no malicious activity or payloads are present.  \n   - **Security Risk (0):** Correct, assigning a version string is benign.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions:**  \n   - No assumptions are made beyond the code's content; all analyses are appropriate.\n\n5. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   - All reports assign maximum confidence (1) and zero for obfuscation, malware, and security risk, which is appropriate.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** The code is trivial; no signs of obfuscation or malware.  \n- **Potential Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are present; the code is purely declarative.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard version string assignment with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and typical in open-source Python packages.",
