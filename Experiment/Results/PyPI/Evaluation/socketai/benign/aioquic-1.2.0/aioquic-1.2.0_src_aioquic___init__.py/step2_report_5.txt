  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**  \n   All reports consistently identify that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`. There are no input sources, data flows, sinks, or external interactions. The code is straightforward and typical in Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes:**  \n   No report indicates any logical errors or suspicious patterns. The code is minimal and standard, with no anomalies or signs of obfuscation.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**  \n   - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the simplicity and clarity of the code.  \n   - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no malicious activity.  \n   - **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.  \n   - **Confidence:** 1.0 or 1, reflecting high certainty that the code is benign.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports assign 0 to malware and security risk, and the code is a standard version string assignment, there's no reason to assign higher risk scores.\n\n5. **Potential Assumptions or Claims:**  \n   No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected or implied)  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall Justification:\n\nThis code snippet is a standard, harmless version declaration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns. The high confidence scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that accurately.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0",
