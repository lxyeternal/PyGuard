  "purpose": "Declare the version of the package, a standard practice in Python packages.",
  "sources": "None; the code is a simple assignment statement.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process input or produce output.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code is straightforward with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string to __version__, a common practice for versioning. It contains no input sources, data flows, sinks, or external interactions. The code is minimal, clear, and standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard version string assignment with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and no adjustments are necessary.",
