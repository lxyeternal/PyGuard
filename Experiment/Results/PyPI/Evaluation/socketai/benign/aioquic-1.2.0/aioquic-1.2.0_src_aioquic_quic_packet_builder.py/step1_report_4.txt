  "purpose": "Helper class for building and managing QUIC packets within a networking protocol implementation.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters, class attributes, and imported modules; reads from buffers during packet construction.",
  "sinks": "Writes data to buffers during packet construction, including packet headers, payload, and padding; encrypts data in place.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and buffer reads to buffer writes during packet creation, encryption, and finalization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or misleading variable usage observed. No suspicious network activity, system access, or data exfiltration routines evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured implementation for building QUIC protocol packets, including handling buffer management, encryption, padding, and packet headers. It carefully manages buffer sizes, packet types, and encryption routines, with no signs of malicious logic. The presence of logging and padding aligns with protocol compliance. There are no suspicious external data flows, system calls, or covert channels. The code appears to be standard, protocol-specific packet handling without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate packet-building functions for a QUIC protocol implementation. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The structure is consistent with standard networking protocol code, and no malicious activity is evident.",
