  "purpose": "Helper class for constructing and managing QUIC packets for network transmission, including packet creation, framing, padding, and encryption.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include: method parameters (host_cid, peer_cid, version, packet_type, etc.), buffer operations (push_uint_var, push_bytes, seek, data_slice), and external crypto methods (encrypt_packet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include: encryption output (encrypt_packet), buffer writes (push_bytes, push_uint8, push_uint16, push_uint32), and network transmission via assembled datagrams.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into buffer during packet/frame construction, then through encryption, and finally into datagrams for transmission. Sensitive data (e.g., packet number, CID, token) are embedded into packet headers. Encrypted payloads are written back to buffer before finalization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No malicious or backdoor logic present. Use of standard cryptographic methods and packet framing appears normal. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs QUIC packets, handling headers, padding, encryption, and datagram assembly. It checks buffer sizes, manages packet numbering, and applies padding according to RFC specifications. The crypto calls are for packet encryption, which is standard. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident. The code’s structure and logic are typical for a network packet builder. It is comprehensive and appears to serve legitimate networking purposes without suspicious modifications or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of a QUIC packet builder, managing packet creation, framing, encryption, and datagram assembly without any signs of malicious activity or sabotage. No security risks or malware indications are present based on the provided code.",
