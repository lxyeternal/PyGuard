  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a QUIC packet builder with no signs of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. Overall, the code appears secure and protocol-compliant."
