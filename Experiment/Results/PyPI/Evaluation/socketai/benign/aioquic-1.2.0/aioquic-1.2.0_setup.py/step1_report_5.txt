{
  "purpose": "This script is designed to set up and build Python extension modules, specifically for the aioquic package, with platform-specific compilation options.",
  "sources": "Reads system platform via sys.platform; sources for extension modules from 'src/aioquic/_buffer.c' and 'src/aioquic/_crypto.c'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that could lead to data leakage or malicious effects; no untrusted data handling or external communications present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration is based on system properties, not user input.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior; code appears to be a standard setup script for compiling C extensions.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally sets compilation arguments based on the platform, defines extension modules with source files and libraries, and customizes the wheel distribution tag. All code aligns with standard practices for building C extensions in Python. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious external communication. The only notable aspect is the platform-specific configuration, which is common in such setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate build setup script for Python C extensions without any malicious intent or security risks. It performs typical build configuration tasks for the 'aioquic' package.",
