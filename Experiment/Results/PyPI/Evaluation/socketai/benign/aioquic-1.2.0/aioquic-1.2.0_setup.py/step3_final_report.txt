{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for building Python C extensions for the 'aioquic' package, handling platform-specific compilation arguments and libraries, and customizing wheel tags for ABI compatibility.",
  "sources": "The code reads local source files ('src/aioquic/_buffer.c' and 'src/aioquic/_crypto.c'), platform detection via 'sys.platform', and defines macros and libraries for compilation.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs, network communications, or data leaks; the script solely configures build parameters.",
  "flows": "Platform detection influences 'extra_compile_args' and 'libraries'; these are used in extension module definitions during setup.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured setup script for building C extensions in Python. It performs platform-specific configuration, defines extension modules with source files and macros, and customizes wheel tags. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data handling is evident. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and very low security risks. The code aligns with best practices for cross-platform extension building and contains no anomalies or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a legitimate, standard build configuration script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. All assessments are consistent, and the scores should reflect its benign nature.",
