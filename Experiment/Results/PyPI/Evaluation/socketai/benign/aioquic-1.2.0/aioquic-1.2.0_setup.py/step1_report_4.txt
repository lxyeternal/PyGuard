  "purpose": "Configure build process for a Python package with C extensions, handling platform-specific settings.",
  "sources": "sys.platform check, setuptools.setup() call with extension sources and macros",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or output streams",
  "flows": "Platform detection influences compilation args and libraries used for extensions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard build script structure, no obfuscated code or hidden logic",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally sets compilation arguments and libraries based on the operating system, then defines two C extension modules with specified sources and macros. It customizes the wheel build command for ABI compatibility. No user input, network access, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward build configuration script for a Python package with native extensions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It functions as intended for build setup.",
