{
  "purpose": "This script configures the build process for a Python package, specifically compiling C extensions for the 'aioquic' library.",
  "sources": "sys.platform, setuptools, wheel.bdist_wheel, and source files in src/aioquic/ directory",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data used in security-sensitive operations or data leaks",
  "flows": "sys.platform influences compile arguments and libraries; these are used in setting up extensions",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; standard setup script with platform-specific compile options",
  "analysis": "The code defines compile-time configurations based on the platform and customizes the wheel distribution. It loads platform info, sets compile arguments, and specifies C source files for extensions. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic detected. Uses standard Python build tools and conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for building C extensions in a Python package without malicious intent or suspicious behaviors. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious data flows are evident.",
