{
  "purpose": "Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder used to generate project documentation.",
  "sources": "os and sys modules, appending to sys.path, defining project info, extensions, theme options, and static paths.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data is processed or output that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicative of malicious behavior; code primarily sets configuration parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules (os, sys) and appends a relative path to sys.path, typical for configuration scripts. It defines project metadata, extensions, theme options, and static paths for documentation. All code functions as static configuration without external data input, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It serves its purpose as a static setup script without executing or including any harmful behaviors.",
