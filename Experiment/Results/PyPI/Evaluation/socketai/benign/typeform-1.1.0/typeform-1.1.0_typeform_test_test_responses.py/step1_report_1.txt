{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Typeform API wrapper, specifically testing response listing and deletion methods.",
  "sources": "Code reads the TOKEN constant from fixtures, constructs URLs for API requests, and makes HTTP requests using requests_mock.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs via requests_mock (simulated), not actual network calls; no untrusted data execution or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data (TOKEN, formID, request parameters) flows into URL construction; requests are sent with these URLs. No untrusted data flows into critical sinks like system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials beyond TOKEN (which appears to be a test fixture), no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard set of unit tests for a Python API wrapper. It uses a mock library for HTTP requests, avoiding real network interactions. No hardcoded secrets beyond a test token, no malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are present. The use of requests_mock is appropriate for testing purposes and does not introduce security risks. Overall, the code is straightforward, test-focused, and does not contain malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate unit testing code for the Typeform API client. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected. It uses standard practices for mocking HTTP requests in tests. Security risks are minimal, primarily related to the test token which is presumably a non-sensitive fixture.",
