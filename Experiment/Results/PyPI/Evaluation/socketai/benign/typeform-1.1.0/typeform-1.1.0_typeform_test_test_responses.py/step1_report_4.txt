{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Typeform API client, specifically testing response listing and deletion functionalities.",
  "sources": "User input: None; External data sources: HTTP requests via requests_mock, environment variables like TOKEN, constants like API_BASE_URL.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request methods (GET, DELETE) with URLs constructed from constants and parameters; no direct sink for untrusted data other than request URLs.",
  "flows": "Construction of URLs with formID and parameters; requests_mock intercepts and captures request details; no external or user data flows into the code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; URL constructions are straightforward; no obfuscated code, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious variables; use of standard testing libraries and mock data.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unit testing of the Typeform API client methods using mock requests. URLs are constructed with constant base URLs and form IDs, with parameters passed explicitly through function calls. No user input influences request URLs or data. The tests verify HTTP method correctness, URL accuracy, and proper parameter encoding. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden functionalities. The use of requests_mock ensures no actual network calls are made. The code appears to be a standard testing suite with no suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of unit tests for an API client, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It performs standard testing procedures, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
