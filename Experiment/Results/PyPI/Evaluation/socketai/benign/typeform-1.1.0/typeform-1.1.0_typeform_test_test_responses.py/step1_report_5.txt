{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Typeform API client, testing response listing and deletion functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration and tokens from imported modules and creates mock HTTP requests.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request methods (GET, DELETE) that send requests to the API endpoint.",
  "flows": "Code constructs URLs with parameters, makes HTTP requests using mocked responses; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks outside test context.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no suspicious or obfuscated code, no hidden behaviors. Use of mock objects is standard for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests for a Python API client, using requests_mock to simulate HTTP interactions. It constructs URLs based on known constants and inputs, and verifies request methods and URLs. No data leakage, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. The tests do not perform any network activities outside of the mocked environment, and there are no signs of code injection, data theft, or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate testing suite for the Typeform API client, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard testing practices, and all data handling is contained within the test environment.",
