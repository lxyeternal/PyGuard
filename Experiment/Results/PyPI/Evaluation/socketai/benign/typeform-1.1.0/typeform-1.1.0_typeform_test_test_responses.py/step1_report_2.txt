{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the Typeform API client library, testing response listing and deletion functionalities.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration tokens from imported fixtures; reads form IDs from API responses; reads request URL and method from mock request history.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink leads to external systems or data leaks; primarily mocks HTTP requests/responses for testing purposes.",
  "flows": "Test setup fetches form IDs; test methods invoke API calls via the client, which are intercepted by mocks; request history is examined to verify correct request structure.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or unusual code behavior; code uses standard testing and mocking patterns; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a unit test suite using Python's unittest framework for a Typeform API client. It sets up test cases that create, list, and delete form responses, verifying HTTP methods, URLs, and parameters. The use of mocks ensures no real network activity occurs. No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The code adheres to standard testing practices, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward, standard test suite for a Python API client library, with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. It employs common testing and mocking patterns without any suspicious anomalies.",
