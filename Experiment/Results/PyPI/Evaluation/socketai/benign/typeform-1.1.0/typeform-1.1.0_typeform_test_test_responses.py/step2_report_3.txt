  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The report states that the code is standard unit testing for the Typeform API, with no malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security risks. It notes the use of requests_mock, a testing library, and the presence of a test token.\n- **Analysis:** The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets beyond a fixture token, and no malicious activity. The security risk score is low (0.1), justified by the test token being non-sensitive.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, acceptable given the context.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is a standard test suite with no malicious intent, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code uses standard practices, mocks network calls, and does not perform any suspicious activities.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0, consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, the code is a typical unit test setup, with no secrets other than a fixture token, no suspicious code, and no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behaviors are present. The code is purely for testing, with no signs of supply chain or malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, reasonable given the test token.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Confirms that the code is standard testing code, with no malicious activity, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns, no data exfiltration, no code injection, just mock-based tests.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1, justified.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion—legitimate test code, no malicious behaviors, no secrets beyond fixtures, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Standard testing practices, no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Behavior:** All reports agree that the code is purely for testing, with no malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Supply Chain or Security Risks:** The code uses a fixture token, which is typical in tests, and no secrets or sensitive data are hardcoded outside the test fixtures.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis. The security risk scores are low (0.1), justified by the presence of a test token, which is non-sensitive.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to test token, but no real risk)\n\nThe code is standard unit testing code, with no signs of supply chain or malicious security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis assessment is consistent with all reports and the code review.",
