{
  "purpose": "Unit testing of the Typeform API wrapper functions for listing and deleting responses.",
  "sources": "Code reads hardcoded constants (API_BASE_URL, TOKEN), and form IDs obtained dynamically during setup.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to external API endpoints via requests_mock (mocked, not real network calls), no untrusted data is sent to untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "Test functions initiate API calls using the form ID and parameters, but all network interactions are mocked within the test framework.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets other than TOKEN imported from fixtures; no suspicious or unusual code behavior; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical unit test suite for an API wrapper, using requests_mock to intercept HTTP calls. No actual network activity occurs outside the test environment. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. All data flows are within a controlled test context, and no untrusted input is used maliciously. The code appears to be standard test code with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, safe unit testing suite for a Python API wrapper. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It only tests the correct formation of HTTP requests and handling of responses in a controlled environment.",
