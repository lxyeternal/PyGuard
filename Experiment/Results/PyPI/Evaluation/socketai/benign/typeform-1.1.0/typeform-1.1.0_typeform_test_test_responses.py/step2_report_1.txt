  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code provided.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a set of unit tests for the Typeform API wrapper.\n- The code uses requests_mock to intercept HTTP requests, avoiding real network activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets beyond the TOKEN fixture are present.\n- No obfuscated, malicious, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- The code follows standard testing practices.\n- The security risk scores assigned are very low (mostly 0.1), reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Validations:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code constructs URLs based on constants and form IDs, and verifies request method and URL correctness. No issues are observed.\n- **Malware or malicious activity:** No signs of data exfiltration, code injection, backdoors, or other malicious behaviors.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Secrets:** Only the TOKEN from fixtures, which is a test fixture, not a real secret.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** No assumptions are made about untrusted input; all data flows are within the test context.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable test code.\n- **Security risk score:** Mostly 0.1, reflecting the minimal risk due to the presence of a test token and the testing environment.\n\n**Note:** Since the code is strictly test code, the risk scores are appropriately low. The only caveat is the presence of a token, but since it's from fixtures and used solely in testing, this does not constitute a real security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports do not identify any actual issues; they correctly conclude that the code is benign.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. No errors are evident.\n\n- **Scores seem reasonable?**  \n  Yes, the scores align with the analysis.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5?**  \n  No, all are well below 0.5, which is appropriate for non-malicious test code.\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  The malware score is 0, which is justified. No malicious activity is present.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No, the reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on observable code behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Based on all reports and code review, I estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (minimal, related to the presence of a test token, but within a test environment and not a real secret)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, legitimate unit test suite for the Typeform API client, with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nNo changes needed; the assessments are accurate and justified.",
