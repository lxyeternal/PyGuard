  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is a set of unit tests for a Python client library for the Typeform API.\n- Uses `requests_mock` to simulate HTTP requests.\n- Tests include listing responses, deleting responses, verifying request URLs, methods, and parameters.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The only \"secret\" is a test fixture token, which is standard in testing environments.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### 1. **Presence of malicious code or malware:**\n- The code only performs standard unit testing.\n- No code executes untrusted input, no code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- Uses `requests_mock` appropriately, which is safe.\n- No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Malware score: 0** is justified.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Obfuscation:**\n- The code is straightforward, readable, and uses standard testing practices.\n- No obfuscation or dynamic code generation.\n\n**Obfuscated score: 0** is justified.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Security risk assessment:**\n- The only potential concern is the test token (`TOKEN`) imported from fixtures.\n- Since it's a test fixture, not a real secret, the risk is minimal.\n- No real secrets or credentials are hardcoded.\n- No network calls are made outside the mock environment.\n\n**However**, the reports assign a `securityRisk` of 0.1, likely considering the presence of a token constant.  \nGiven the context, this is acceptable, but it should be noted that the token is a fixture, not a real secret.\n\n**Risk score justification:**  \n- The risk is minimal; no real data or secrets are exposed.\n- The tests do not perform any dangerous operations.\n\n**Recommended risk score:**  \n**0.1** is reasonable, matching the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-report consistency:\n- All reports uniformly identify the code as standard, non-malicious, and using safe practices.\n- They assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0.\n- The security risk scores are slightly above zero, justified by the presence of a token fixture, but not indicating actual vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Metric             | Justification                                                                                   |\n|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**       | 0 — No malicious behavior detected. All code is for testing, no malicious payloads or behaviors. |\n| **Obfuscated**    | 0 — Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.                                                   |\n| **Risk**          | 0.1 — Minimal risk; only the presence of a test token, no real secrets or dangerous operations. |\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\nThe reports are consistent, and I agree with their assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nThe code is a legitimate test suite with no security concerns. The minor risk score reflects the presence of a test token, which is standard practice and not inherently dangerous.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No malware or obfuscation.  \n- Very low security risk, justified by the context.  \n- No supply chain or malicious activity detected.",
