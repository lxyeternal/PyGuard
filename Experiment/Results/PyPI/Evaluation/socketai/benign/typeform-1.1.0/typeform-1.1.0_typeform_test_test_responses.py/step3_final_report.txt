{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of unit tests for the Typeform API wrapper, verifying URL construction, HTTP methods, and parameter passing using requests_mock to simulate network interactions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the TOKEN fixture for authentication, form IDs from the setup, and request URLs during tests.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the constructed request URLs and methods, but these are only used within mocked requests; no untrusted data flows to system or network effects.",
  "flows": "Input data from fixtures (TOKEN, form IDs) flows into URL construction; request methods and URLs are verified via request history; no untrusted data flows into system or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, with no obfuscated or suspicious constructs, and no hardcoded secrets beyond test fixtures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured unit test suite for a Python API client, using requests_mock to intercept HTTP requests. It verifies correct URL formation, request methods, and parameters. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The only sensitive element is the TOKEN fixture, which is typical in testing environments. The security risk score is minimal (around 0.1), justified by the non-sensitive nature of the token. The malware score is 0, as there are no malicious activities, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code's clarity. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard unit testing suite with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The minimal security risk is due to the presence of a test fixture token, which is typical and non-sensitive. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
