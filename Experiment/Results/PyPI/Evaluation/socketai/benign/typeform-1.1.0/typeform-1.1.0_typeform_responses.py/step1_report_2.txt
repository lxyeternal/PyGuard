{
  "purpose": "This code provides a client interface for interacting with the Typeform Responses API, allowing listing and deletion of responses for a specific form.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'uid', 'pageSize', 'since', 'until', 'after', 'before', 'includedResponseIds', 'completed', 'sort', 'query', 'fields', and 'includedTokens' are used as data sources.",
  "sinks": "The '__client.request' method calls act as sinks where data (such as form responses or deletion requests) is sent to external API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function input parameters (sources) into the 'request' method calls (sinks), constructing API requests with these parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious data handling observed. Usage of string interpolation with 'uid' appears straightforward. No obfuscated or unusual code features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that wraps API calls to the Typeform responses endpoint. It uses user-supplied parameters to build request data, which is passed to an external API via the '__client.request' method. There are no signs of malicious payloads, code injection, or hidden behaviors. The parameters are used in a standard manner, and the functions perform typical API interactions for listing and deleting responses. No suspicious data flows, backdoors, or data leaks are evident. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose as a wrapper for API operations without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API client wrapper with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. It interacts with external services in a controlled manner, and no malicious payloads or anomalies are present.",
