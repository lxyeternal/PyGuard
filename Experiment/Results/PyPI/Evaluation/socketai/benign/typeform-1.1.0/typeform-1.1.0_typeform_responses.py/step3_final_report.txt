{
  "purpose": "API wrapper class for interacting with Typeform Responses API, providing methods to list and delete responses.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as 'uid', 'includedTokens', and other method arguments; URL string interpolation with 'uid'; request parameters passed directly to the request method.",
  "sinks": "The 'self.__client.request()' method which executes HTTP requests; potential URL injection via 'uid' if untrusted and not validated.",
  "flows": "Input 'uid' flows into URL construction; parameters flow into request payload; request method executes HTTP call.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string interpolation with 'uid' in URL without visible validation; no secrets or obfuscation; straightforward request construction.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple API client wrapper with methods 'list' and 'delete' that construct HTTP requests using user-supplied parameters. The primary concern is the use of 'uid' in URL paths via string formatting, which could lead to URL injection if 'uid' is untrusted and not sanitized. The request method's internal handling is unknown, but assuming standard HTTP client behavior, the risk is minimal. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's logic is clear, and it does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions. The overall security risk is low, primarily hinging on whether 'uid' is validated externally. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting minor concern over input validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward API wrapper with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The main security consideration is ensuring 'uid' is validated or sanitized before use to prevent URL injection. Given the available information, there is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a slight risk score around 0.2 due to potential input validation issues.",
