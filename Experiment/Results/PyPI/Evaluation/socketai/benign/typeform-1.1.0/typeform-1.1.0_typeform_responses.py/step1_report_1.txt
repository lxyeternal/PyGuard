  "purpose": "Client interface for interacting with Typeform Responses API, enabling listing and deleting responses.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include method parameters: uid, pageSize, since, until, after, before, includedResponseIds, completed, sort, query, fields, and includedTokens.",
  "sinks": "Requests sent via self.__client.request with parameters that include user-supplied data, potentially leading to injection or data leakage if not properly sanitized.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into API request parameters without evident validation or sanitization, then into network requests to external API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string interpolation for URL construction ('/forms/%s/responses' % uid) could be vulnerable if 'uid' is untrusted; no validation or sanitization shown. Parameters are passed directly to request method, which may be risky if not handled properly inside self.__client.request.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a wrapper around API calls, passing user inputs directly into request parameters and URLs. The use of string formatting for URL path with 'uid' is a minor concern if 'uid' is untrusted, as it could lead to URL injection if not validated within the request method. The request method's implementation is not shown, so it's unclear whether it sanitizes or encodes inputs properly. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward API wrapper code without evidence of malicious behavior or malware. However, the potential risk is contingent on the implementation of self.__client.request' and validation of 'uid'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API wrapper with minimal risk of malicious activity. The primary concern is the handling of 'uid' in URL construction; if 'uid' is untrusted and not validated, it could lead to URL injection. Otherwise, no malicious intent or malicious code behavior is evident.",
