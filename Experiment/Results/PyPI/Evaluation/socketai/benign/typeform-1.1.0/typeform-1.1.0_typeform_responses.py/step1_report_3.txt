{
  "purpose": "This code provides a client interface for interacting with the Typeform Responses API, allowing listing and deletion of form responses.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as `uid`, `includedResponseIds`, `includedTokens`, and other method arguments; data from method calls.",
  "sinks": "The `request` method of `self.__client`, which presumably sends HTTP requests; the URL and parameters could be manipulated if inputs are untrusted.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input parameters (like `uid`, `includedTokens`, query params) are used to construct API request URLs and parameters, which are then executed via `self.__client.request()`.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code structures, no obfuscated code, no hidden backdoors, and no unusual behaviors detected. The code performs standard API request operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, wrapping API calls within class methods, with no indication of malicious intent. Inputs are used directly in constructing request parameters, which is typical for API clients. No suspicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The request method's implementation is external, but based on this code, the data flow appears normal for an API client. There are no hardcoded secrets or unusual code behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client implementation with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply constructs and sends requests based on user-provided parameters. No malicious or harmful activity is indicated.",
