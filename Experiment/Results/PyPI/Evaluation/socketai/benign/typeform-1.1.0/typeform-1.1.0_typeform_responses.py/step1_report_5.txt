{
  "purpose": "Provide an API client wrapper for interacting with Typeform responses, including listing and deleting responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as 'uid', 'pageSize', 'since', 'until', 'after', 'before', 'includedResponseIds', 'completed', 'sort', 'query', 'fields', and 'includedTokens'.",
  "sinks": "Uses these parameters in HTTP request method calls via self.__client.request, which is a likely HTTP request, potentially exposing data if inputs are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the request method, forming the request URL and parameters; untrusted data could influence request content.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code, no unusual control flow, and no dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper class with methods to list and delete responses from a form. It uses parameter inputs to build request parameters and makes HTTP requests through a client object. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. Inputs are used directly in request parameters, which is typical for API wrappers, and no dangerous operations are present. The code does not handle sensitive secrets internally, nor does it perform any unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign API client wrapper for Typeform responses. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment. It securely delegates network requests to an external client object without any evident security flaws.",
