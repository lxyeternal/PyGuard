{
  "purpose": "This code defines a client class for interacting with the Typeform Responses API, allowing listing and deleting responses.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the 'list' and 'delete' methods, particularly 'uid', 'pageSize', 'since', 'until', 'after', 'before', 'includedResponseIds', 'completed', 'sort', 'query', 'fields', and 'includedTokens'. These are provided by the caller, potentially untrusted.",
  "sinks": "The 'self.__client.request' method calls, which send HTTP requests to the API endpoint. The parameters from user inputs are included directly in these requests.",
  "flows": "User inputs (sources) are passed into the request parameters and then sent to external API endpoints via the client.request method (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The use of string formatting in URL construction is straightforward. No suspicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a wrapper for API interactions with the Typeform responses endpoint. Input parameters are accepted from external sources and used directly in API request parameters. The 'list' method constructs a GET request with optional filters, and the 'delete' method performs a DELETE request with specified tokens. There is no evident data validation, sanitization, or escaping for these inputs. However, these parameters are standard API request parameters and not inherently malicious. The code does not perform any data processing or execution of user-provided code, nor does it contain any obfuscated or malicious logic. The use of string interpolation in URL paths is straightforward and does not appear to be exploited for injection. Overall, there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage in this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple API client wrapper with no malicious intent or malware. It relies on external inputs for API parameters but does not demonstrate any malicious activity or security issues within this code segment.",
