  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the claims, and assess the scores based on the code snippet provided.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward HTTP client wrapper for the TypeForm API.\n- It handles authorization via a token parameter, serializes data to JSON, constructs requests, and parses responses.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious network behavior, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- Use of mutable default arguments (headers, data) is a minor Python anti-pattern but not malicious.\n- Exception handling is standard, based on response content and status code.\n- No evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.**\n\n**Assessment:**  \nMatches the analysis; no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The security risk is minimal.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2**\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report notes the use of mutable default arguments as a minor anti-pattern but not a security threat. The overall analysis aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nThe malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate (0).  \nSecurity risk is slightly above zero due to the mutable defaults, which is acceptable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2**\n\n**Assessment:**  \nSame reasoning as above. The code is standard, with no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2**\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the analysis confirms no malicious behavior. The minor concern about mutable defaults remains.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Score: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2**\n\n**Assessment:**  \nSame as previous; no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports — code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 is consistent with minor coding practices (mutable defaults), not security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard, well-structured API client.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**If I were to assign my own scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (minor coding practices, but not security issues)\n\n**Overall conclusion:** The provided scores are appropriate. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The analysis confirms the code is safe, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The minor security risk score reflects best practices and minor coding patterns but does not indicate real vulnerabilities.",
