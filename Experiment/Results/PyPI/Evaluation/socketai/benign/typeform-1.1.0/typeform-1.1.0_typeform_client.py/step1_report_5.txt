{
  "purpose": "Provides an HTTP client for interacting with the TypeForm API, enabling requests with authorization and handling responses.",
  "sources": "Token input during initialization, method and URL parameters during request execution, optional headers, data payload, and request parameters.",
  "sinks": "requests.request method, json.loads, and raising exceptions based on response content.",
  "flows": "Token and headers → request method → request URL and data → requests.request call → response processing in __validator.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious external network connections or obfuscated code; no unusual data handling beyond typical API requests.",
  "analysis": "The code creates an API client with provided token and headers, merges headers, constructs request URLs with parameters, and sends HTTP requests using the requests library. The response is parsed as JSON, and errors are raised based on response content or status code. The code does not contain any code injection, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. No obfuscated patterns or hidden behaviors are present. Usage of requests and json libraries is standard. The code appears to be a typical API client implementation with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of an API client for TypeForm, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles data securely and does not leak information or perform any suspicious activities.",
