  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets beyond the token parameter, standard libraries, proper response validation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 (or very close, at 0).\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code review. The low risk and malware scores are justified. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Uses mutable default arguments (`headers={}`), which is a known Python anti-pattern but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The minor security risk score reflects the mutable default argument concern, which is a best practice issue but not a security vulnerability. The malware score remains 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to previous, straightforward API client, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard JSON handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The low scores are appropriate. No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Standard API client, no malicious code, no obfuscation, minor concern about mutable default argument.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code, no issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, straightforward API client, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above 0 (0.2) in most reports due to minor coding practices (mutable default arguments), which are not security vulnerabilities but are acknowledged as best practice concerns.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — Code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — Slightly elevated due to mutable default arguments, which is acceptable but worth noting.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The code does not perform any suspicious or malicious actions.\n- The use of mutable default arguments should be corrected for best practices but does not introduce security risks.\n- No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.\n\n**Conclusion:** The overall assessment aligns with the reports. The code is a standard, safe API client with minor coding practice issues that do not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**Final scores I recommend:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**   | **0**        | **0.2** |\n\nThis reflects a clean, non-malicious codebase with a minor best practice concern.",
