  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-reference with the provided code snippet.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a standard API client wrapper for the TypeForm API.\n- No hardcoded secrets beyond the token parameter, which is passed externally.\n- Use of mergeDict for headers, JSON serialization/deserialization, and request handling appears standard.\n- No obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or malicious payloads are identified.\n- Exception handling is typical, raising exceptions on error responses.\n- Mutable default arguments (headers and data) are present but are a known Python anti-pattern, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Specific review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Analysis:** Accurately describes the code as straightforward, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** No issues. The score aligns with the report's conclusion.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2\n- **Analysis:** Notes mutable default arguments but no malicious intent.\n- **Verdict:** The security risk score of 0.2 is reasonable given the mutable default args, but not indicative of a security vulnerability or malware.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2\n- **Analysis:** Similar to previous, no malicious activity, standard API client.\n- **Verdict:** The score seems appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2\n- **Analysis:** Same reasoning as above.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with others; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports is correct. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is justified; no obfuscated code detected.\n- **Risk score:** The risk scores of 0.2 reflect minor concerns about mutable default arguments, but these are not security vulnerabilities per se.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential adjustments:**\n\n- **Security Risk Score:** While the minor issue of mutable default arguments exists, it does not constitute a security vulnerability. Therefore, maintaining a score of 0.2 is acceptable, but it could be lowered to 0 if desired, emphasizing that it's a coding best practice concern rather than a security flaw.\n- **Malware and Obfuscated scores:** Remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Final recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1 to 0.2** (minor coding practice issue, but not a security vulnerability)\n\n**Given the evidence, I suggest keeping the risk score at 0.2 for consistency, but it's worth noting that this is a minor coding practice concern rather than a security risk.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard, straightforward API client with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The existing scores are appropriate. The only minor concern is the use of mutable default arguments, which does not impact security but is a known Python anti-pattern.\n\n**Final estimate:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk  |\n|---------|--------------|--------|\n| **0** | **0** | **0.2** |\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
