  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a standard API client wrapper for the TypeForm API.\n- No hardcoded secrets beyond the token parameter.\n- Use of mergeDict for headers is typical.\n- JSON serialization and response validation are straightforward.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- The code uses mutable default arguments for headers and data, which is a known Python anti-pattern but not malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code review. No issues found.\n- **Risk justification:** The code is a simple API client with no malicious activity.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score due to mutable default arguments (headers). This is a minor code quality concern but not a security vulnerability.\n- **Score justification:** The score of 0.2 is reasonable, reflecting minor code practices but no real security threat.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 2, consistent reasoning. No malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Appropriate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Same reasoning as above. No malicious behavior.\n- **Score justification:** Reasonable.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Score:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, securityRisk = 0.2\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others, no malicious activity.\n- **Score justification:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly elevated at 0.2 due to minor code practices (mutable default arguments), which are not security vulnerabilities but are worth noting.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (minor code quality concern, but not security risk)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are appropriate given the code. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard, straightforward API client with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The minor security risk score reflects typical code quality issues rather than security vulnerabilities.",
