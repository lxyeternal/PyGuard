  "purpose": "HTTP client wrapper for interacting with the TypeForm API, facilitating requests with authorization and handling responses.",
  "sources": "token input parameter, data parameter, headers parameter, URL parameter, environment variables (potentially for token if externally sourced).",
  "sinks": "requests.request function, json.dumps, json.loads, raise Exception, request headers and data used in HTTP request.",
  "flows": "token (source) → Authorization header; data (source) → JSON serialization; URL and params → buildUrlWithParams; request → __validator → raise Exception or return parsed JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets beyond the token parameter; no unusual or suspicious code behaviors; use of mergeDict for headers is standard. No obfuscated code, no malicious payload detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a straightforward API client implementation with methods for sending HTTP requests and validating responses. The token is passed as a parameter, avoiding hardcoded secrets. Data is serialized securely using json.dumps, and responses are parsed with json.loads, with error handling. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behavior are identified. The exception handling for response validation is typical, and no malicious code or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured HTTP client for the TypeForm API with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It handles data serialization and response validation appropriately without evident malicious intent.",
