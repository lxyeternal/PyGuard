{
  "purpose": "This code implements an API client for the TypeForm service, allowing HTTP requests with authorization and JSON handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters 'token', 'headers', 'method', 'url', 'data', and 'params'. It also reads the response content from the 'requests' library response object.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is 'requests.request', which sends data over the network. The JSON parsing of response text is also a sink that could potentially process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The 'request' method builds a URL with parameters, merges headers, serializes data if it's a dict or list, and sends an HTTP request. The response is parsed from JSON, with error handling that raises exceptions based on response content or status code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials beyond the 'token' parameter, which is expected. The code uses 'mergeDict' to combine headers but does not perform unsafe operations. No obfuscated code, no unusual control flow, and no suspicious dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward API client that constructs requests with given parameters and handles responses with standard JSON parsing and error checking. It does not contain hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. The network request is a standard HTTP call, with input data sanitized by JSON serialization. Exception handling is typical for API response validation. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident from the implementation.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a standard API client with no apparent malicious intent. It securely handles request construction and response validation without suspicious behavior or security risks.",
