  "purpose": "A straightforward HTTP client wrapper for the TypeForm API, handling authorization, request construction, and response validation.",
  "sources": "Token parameter for authorization; request data and parameters; response text for validation.",
  "sinks": "Response body parsing and exception raising based on response content and status code.",
  "flows": "Token input -> request headers; data serialization -> request body; response text -> JSON parsing -> error handling or return.",
  "anomalies": "Use of mutable default arguments for headers and data, which is a known Python anti-pattern but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity. It serializes data to JSON, constructs requests, and validates responses appropriately. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present. The only minor concern is the use of mutable default arguments, which can lead to bugs but not security vulnerabilities. Exception handling is standard, and response validation is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured API client with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2 due to minor coding practice issues. No adjustments are necessary.",
