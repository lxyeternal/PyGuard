{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package named 'typeform' with metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; importing setup and find_packages from setuptools; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "None. The code does not write or execute untrusted data; no sinks for malicious data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup configuration is static and predetermined.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns. The setup script appears standard with no obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical package setup, importing standard libraries, reading a README file, and configuring package metadata. No external or untrusted data sources are used during execution. The only file read is a static README.md file, which is safe. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling is present. The dependencies are standard and explicitly specified. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. It appears safe and aligns with common practices for Python package distribution.",
