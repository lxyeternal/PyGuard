  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing a Python client SDK for the Typeform API",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; no other input sources",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs; setup configurations are static",
  "flows": "Reads local file for description, then proceeds with package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code structures, no obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard packaging functions from setuptools, reads a local markdown file for the description, and configures package setup parameters. All inputs are static or local files, with no external or untrusted data. The dependencies and metadata are typical for a Python package, with no indication of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is a standard package configuration with no signs of malicious code or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-formed package setup file.",
