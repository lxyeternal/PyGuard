{
  "purpose": "Defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'typeform', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; static package metadata within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data outputs or external commands executed.",
  "flows": "Reading the file content for description (source) does not lead to any processing or output that could be malicious.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs observed. The code follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures using setuptools. It reads a markdown file for description, specifies package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No code execution or data manipulation occurs beyond static configuration. No input/output or network activity is present. The code is straightforward and typical for Python package setup, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a normal setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
