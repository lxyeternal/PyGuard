{
  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for a Python package named 'typeform' for distribution via PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; gathering package metadata from setup() arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data is written or transmitted to external sources.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' content as input; using static package setup parameters; no flow of untrusted data to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup using setuptools. It reads a Markdown file for description, defines package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No user input, environment variables, or untrusted data sources are involved. The code structure and logic are typical for Python packaging and do not contain malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for packaging a Python project with no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
