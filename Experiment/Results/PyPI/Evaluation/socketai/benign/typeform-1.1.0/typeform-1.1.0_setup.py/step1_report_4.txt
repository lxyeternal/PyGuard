  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package called 'typeform', used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; obtaining package information and dependencies for setup.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no code writes data, executes commands, or interacts with external systems directly.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' -> configuring package metadata -> executing setup() with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs standard setup procedures without suspicious modifications or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file for description content, then invokes setuptools.setup() with package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and testing configuration. All actions are typical for a Python setup script. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials, and no untrusted input processing are present. The dependencies are standard and well-known. No malicious or suspicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and benign Python package setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
