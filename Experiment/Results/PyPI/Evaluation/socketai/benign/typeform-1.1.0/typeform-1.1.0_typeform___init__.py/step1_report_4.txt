{
  "purpose": "This code defines a client interface for interacting with the Typeform API, providing access to forms and responses via class properties.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the constructor parameters 'token' and 'headers', which are used to initialize the Client object.",
  "sinks": "The 'token' parameter could potentially be sensitive if misused; however, it is used only for authentication within the Client class, which is not shown here.",
  "flows": "Token and headers flow into the Client instantiation, which then supplies the client object to Forms and Responses classes; no external untrusted data flows outside this initialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and typical for an API client setup.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Typeform API client object with a token and optional headers. It creates instances of Forms and Responses classes, which likely handle API interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks. Sensitive data (token) is only used internally for client setup and not stored insecurely or transmitted elsewhere. The code structure is simple and standard for such API wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a benign, standard API client setup with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities detected. It handles API authentication and provides access to form and response data through properties.",
