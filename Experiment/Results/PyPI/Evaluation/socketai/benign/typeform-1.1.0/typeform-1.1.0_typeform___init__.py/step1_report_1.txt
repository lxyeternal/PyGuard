{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python class for a Typeform API client, which manages interactions with forms and responses through underlying client and data classes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'token' and 'headers' in the __init__ method, which are used to initialize the Client object.",
  "sinks": "The 'Client' object initialized with 'token' and 'headers' could be used for API requests; however, in this code, no sensitive data is directly sent or retrieved within this module.",
  "flows": "Token and headers flow from the __init__ method to the Client object, which then interacts with Forms and Responses classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are present. The use of mutable default argument 'headers={}' is a minor Python anti-pattern but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as a wrapper for API interaction, initializing client objects with provided credentials and exposing properties for forms and responses. There are no hardcoded credentials, no data leakage, and no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected. The only potential concern is the mutable default argument for 'headers', which could lead to unintended shared state, but this is a known Python issue rather than malicious intent. Overall, the code appears clean, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API client wrapper with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply initializes a client with user-provided tokens and exposes access to forms and responses. The overall security risk is very low.",
