{
  "purpose": "This code defines a client class for interacting with the Typeform API, encapsulating form and response management functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input data includes the 'token' string and optional 'headers' dictionary provided during initialization.",
  "sinks": "The 'token' could be misused if exposed, but there are no evident sinks that leak data or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "The flow involves passing the token and headers to the Client class, which then is used to initialize Forms and Responses objects; no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code appears straightforward and standard for an API client wrapper.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an API client class that uses dependency injection of a token and headers, then initializes internal components for forms and responses. The class exposes properties to access these components. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behaviors, or suspicious data handling. The design follows standard practices for API client wrappers. No potentially malicious or insecure operations are present. The only potential concern is the 'token' string being stored in the object, but that is typical for API clients and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard API client wrapper for Typeform integration, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
