{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Python class 'Typeform' that serves as a client for interacting with the Typeform API, encapsulating forms and responses functionalities.",
  "sources": "Input data includes the 'token' and 'headers' parameters provided during the instantiation of the 'Typeform' class.",
  "sinks": "The 'token' and 'headers' are used to initialize the 'Client' object, which likely handles API communication. No other data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'token' and 'headers' -> create 'Client' instance -> initialize 'Forms' and 'Responses' with 'Client' -> expose 'forms' and 'responses' properties.",
  "anomalies": "The default value for 'headers' is an empty dictionary '{}', which can be problematic if modified at runtime due to mutable default argument. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, establishing an API client with dependency injection for token and headers. The use of a mutable default argument (headers={}) is a minor concern but not malicious. The 'Client' class's implementation details are not provided, but based on context, it likely manages API communication securely. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious code are present. The structure and logic are standard for API client wrappers.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, non-malicious API client wrapper for Typeform. No malware or malicious behavior detected. The only minor concern is the mutable default argument for 'headers', which could be improved but is not a security risk.",
