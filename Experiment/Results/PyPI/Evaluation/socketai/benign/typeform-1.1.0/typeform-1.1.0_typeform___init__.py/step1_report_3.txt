{
  "purpose": "Define a client interface for interacting with the Typeform API, providing access to forms and responses.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to __init__ method (token, headers).",
  "sinks": "Potential use of token for API authentication, but not directly used in this code snippet beyond passing to Client.",
  "flows": "token and headers flow into Client object creation, which then supplies data to Forms and Responses objects.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code. Usage of default mutable argument for headers (dict = {}) is a minor concern but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Typeform API client with a token and optional headers, creating internal Forms and Responses objects using a Client instance. There are no data leaks, malicious data flows, or suspicious behaviors observed. The token is passed to a Client class, but without seeing its implementation, no malicious activity can be inferred. The code structure appears standard for an API client wrapper. No unusual code or potential backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward API client wrapper with no signs of malicious behavior. The only minor concern is the use of a mutable default argument for headers, which is not inherently malicious but could lead to unintended side effects if modified. Overall, the code appears benign.",
