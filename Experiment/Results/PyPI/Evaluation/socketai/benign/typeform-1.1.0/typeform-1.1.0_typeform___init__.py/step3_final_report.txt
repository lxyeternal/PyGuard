  "purpose": "Provides a Python API client wrapper for Typeform, initializing a client with a token and exposing forms and responses interfaces.",
  "sources": "The token parameter used in Client initialization; headers parameter in __init__ method.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data flows leading to leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Initialization of Client with token; accessors for forms and responses.",
  "anomalies": "Use of mutable default argument headers={}; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client wrapper that initializes a Client with a token and optional headers, then exposes properties for forms and responses. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscation are present. The only minor concern is the mutable default argument headers={}, which can lead to shared state but is not malicious. No data leaks, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are detected. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting the minor coding style issue. The code's simplicity and standard structure indicate benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard API client wrapper with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The only issue is the mutable default argument, which should be replaced with headers=None and initialized inside the constructor for best practices. Overall, the code is safe, with a very low security risk.",
