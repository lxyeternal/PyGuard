{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to load and discover unit tests from a specified directory and pattern using Python's unittest framework.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'typeform.test' directory and any files matching the pattern 'test_*.py'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process or execute untrusted data beyond test discovery.",
  "flows": "Input data (file directory and pattern) flows from the function arguments into unittest's discover method, but no untrusted data is executed or transmitted elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and standard for test discovery.",
  "analysis": "The code imports unittest, defines a function 'test_suite' that creates a unittest TestLoader, and uses it to discover tests in the 'typeform.test' directory matching 'test_*.py'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security issues. It is a typical test setup with no external data processing or execution beyond standard test discovery.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test discovery snippet with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
