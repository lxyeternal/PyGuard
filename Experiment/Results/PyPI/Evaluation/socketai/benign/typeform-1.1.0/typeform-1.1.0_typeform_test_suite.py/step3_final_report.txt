{
  "purpose": "This code defines a test suite loader that discovers test modules in the 'typeform.test' directory matching 'test_*.py'.",
  "sources": "Static strings 'typeform.test' and 'test_*.py' used in the discover() method.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs processed; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Static source strings passed directly to the discover() method without transformation or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward use of unittest's discover method with static parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code imports unittest, defines a function that creates a TestLoader, and calls discover() with fixed directory and pattern. No dynamic inputs, no code execution, no network activity, no obfuscation. The code is a standard test discovery pattern, safe and benign. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are present. The static nature and simplicity of the code indicate a low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe test suite loader with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is negligible. No modifications are necessary.",
