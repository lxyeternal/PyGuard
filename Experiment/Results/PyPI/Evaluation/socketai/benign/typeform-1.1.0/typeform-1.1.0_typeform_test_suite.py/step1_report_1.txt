{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to load and discover unit tests from a specified directory.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string inputs in the 'discover' method call ('typeform.test' and 'test_*.py')",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data or inputs are processed or executed",
  "flows": "Input source (static strings) used in 'discover' method without any dynamic or external data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious code structures observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'unittest' module and defines a function 'test_suite' which creates a TestLoader instance and uses it to discover test modules matching 'test_*.py' in the 'typeform.test' package. There are no dynamic inputs, external data sources, or execution of untrusted data. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard testing practices. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident. The use of static strings indicates intentional, controlled behavior. No anomalies or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test discovery utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply loads tests from a specific directory pattern. The overall security risk is negligible.",
