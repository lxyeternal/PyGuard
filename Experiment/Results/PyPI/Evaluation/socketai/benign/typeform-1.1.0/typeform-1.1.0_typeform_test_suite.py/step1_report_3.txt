  "purpose": "Defines a test suite loader for discovering and running unit tests in the 'typeform.test' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'typeform.test' directory for test files matching 'test_*.py'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input is the test directory and pattern, which are used by unittest's discover method to locate test files.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the unittest module, defines a function to load tests from a specific directory using unittest's discover method. There are no inputs from external sources, no data leakage points, and no suspicious code logic. It simply sets up a test discovery mechanism.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite setup with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is safe and typical for Python testing workflows.",
