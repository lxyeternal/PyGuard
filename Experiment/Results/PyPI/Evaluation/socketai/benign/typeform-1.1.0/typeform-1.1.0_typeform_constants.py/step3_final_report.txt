{
  "purpose": "This code defines a static list of font names and a fixed API URL, likely used for configuration purposes in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The list of font names and the API_BASE_URL string are static data assigned directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks involving untrusted input or external data processing; the code does not handle user input or perform network operations beyond defining a URL string.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely static configuration with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant data definitions: a list of font names and a URL string. There are no dynamic behaviors, input handling, network requests, or code execution. The URL points to a legitimate domain (typeform.com), and the font list appears typical for UI configuration. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The static nature and simplicity suggest a benign configuration snippet. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, benign configuration snippet with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
