{
  "purpose": "Define a list of available font names and set the base URL for an API.",
  "sources": "The font list and the API_BASE_URL string are hardcoded constants; no external data input is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or external inputs; no network requests or data transmissions are present in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only defines static variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward, defining static configuration data without any suspicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a list of font names assigned to a constant and a URL string. No dynamic code execution, input handling, or network activity is present. No signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The structure and content appear typical for configuration data. As the code is static and does not perform any operations beyond variable declaration, it shows no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple configuration snippet defining fonts and an API base URL. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code segment.",
