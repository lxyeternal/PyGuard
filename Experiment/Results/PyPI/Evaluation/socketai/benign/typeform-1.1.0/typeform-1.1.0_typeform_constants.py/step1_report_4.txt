{
  "purpose": "Define a list of available fonts and set a base URL for an API, likely for UI or web application configuration.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code only contains static data definitions.",
  "sinks": "None present; there are no data sinks or untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is static configuration with no execution flow involving external data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code structures, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a static list of font names assigned to a variable and a string URL assigned to another variable. There are no functions, user input handling, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The presence of font names and a URL endpoint appears typical for configuration purposes in a UI context. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static configuration data with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
