{
  "purpose": "The code defines a list of available font names and a base URL for an API, likely used for font selection and API interactions in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The font list is a hardcoded static list; the API_BASE_URL is a hardcoded string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or user input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks are evident, as the code only defines static variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual behaviors are present. The API URL is standard and does not connect to suspicious domains.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains static data definitions: a list of font names and a URL string for an API endpoint. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations visible. No input handling, no data leaks, and no dynamic code execution are present. The URL used is a known domain for typeform services, which is legitimate. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration or constants snippet defining available fonts and an API base URL. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
