  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static configuration data: a list of font names and an API URL.\n- No dynamic behavior, input handling, network requests, or code execution is shown.\n- The API URL points to a legitimate domain (typeform.com).\n- No obfuscation, suspicious constructs, or anomalies are identified.\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which seems appropriate given the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming Issues in the Code:\n- The code snippet is straightforward: a list of font names and a URL string.\n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are present or implied.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n- They correctly identify the code as static configuration with no malicious intent.\n- No flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, as the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the static, benign nature.\n\n### Potential Risks and Justification:\n- Since the code is static configuration, the risk is minimal.\n- The only potential concern would be if the API URL was malicious or if the font list was maliciously injected or modified dynamically, but nothing indicates that here.\n- The URL is from a known legitimate domain.\n- No signs of malicious payloads, code injection, or backdoors.\n\n### Final Critical Evaluation:\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n- No evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk in static configuration)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a simple, static configuration snippet with no security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is benign and static.  \n- No issues or malicious activity are present.  \n- The scores reflect this assessment accurately.",
