  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and correctness.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe static, hardcoded lists of font names and a fixed API URL.\n- No dynamic code, input handling, network requests, or obfuscation are present.\n- The URL used is `https://api.typeform.com`, a legitimate, well-known service.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity are detected.\n- The \"malware\" scores are all 0, aligning with the static, benign nature of the code.\n- The \"obfuscated\" scores are 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- The \"securityRisk\" scores are 0, consistent with the static, non-interactive code snippet.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The code snippets do not contain any errors, flaws, or mistakes.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound; all conclude the code is benign.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- The reports are very similar; they all essentially describe the same static configuration code.\n- Since the code is static and straightforward, assigning a risk score higher than 0.0 would be unreasonable.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n- No changes are necessary to the scores; they are consistent with the analysis.\n- The reasoning is thorough and justified.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis correctly states the code's benign nature.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- The code is a static configuration snippet with no malicious intent.\n- The scores reflect this accurately.\n- The reports are consistent and reasonable.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:** Since the code is purely static data with no dynamic or external activity, the security risk remains negligible, and the scores should remain at zero across all categories.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, consistent, and appropriately scored. No modifications are necessary. The code is benign, with zero malware, no obfuscation, and no security risk.",
