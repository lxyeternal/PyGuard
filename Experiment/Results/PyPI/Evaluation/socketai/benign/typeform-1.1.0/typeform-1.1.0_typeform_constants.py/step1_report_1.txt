{
  "purpose": "Define a list of available font names and specify a base URL for an API endpoint.",
  "sources": "The font list is hardcoded; the API_BASE_URL is a fixed string value.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the API_BASE_URL could be used as a network endpoint, but no actual network activity is shown in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are demonstrated, as there are no functions, data input, or network requests in the code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code simply defines constants with no unusual constructs or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a static list of font names assigned to a variable and a URL string assigned to another variable. There are no data inputs, no network requests, and no execution logic present. The content appears to be a configuration or resource list. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The API URL is a standard endpoint and does not show any suspicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward declaration of font options and an API URL, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected. It appears to be part of a configuration or UI component.",
