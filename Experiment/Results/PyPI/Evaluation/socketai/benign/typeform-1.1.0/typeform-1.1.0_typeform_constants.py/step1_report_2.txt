  "purpose": "Define available font names and specify a base URL for an API service.",
  "sources": "Constant list of font names, string assignment for API base URL.",
  "sinks": "Potential usage of API_BASE_URL in network requests or data transmission.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the API_BASE_URL constant into network request functions (not shown).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a list of font names in a constant variable, which appears purely static and benign. The API_BASE_URL is set to a well-known URL for the Typeform API, a legitimate service. No input handling, data processing, or dynamic code execution is present. The code's simplicity suggests it is intended for UI or configuration purposes without any malicious intent or suspicious activity. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious behaviors observable in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defining static data and a URL for an API. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
