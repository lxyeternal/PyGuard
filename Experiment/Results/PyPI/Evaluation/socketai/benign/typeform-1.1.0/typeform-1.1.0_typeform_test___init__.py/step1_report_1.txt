  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script or package component intended for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input from function parameters, environment variables, or external files if any are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes output to files, network sockets, or external systems depending on the functions used.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs observed. No unusual system calls or network activity detected in the provided fragment.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code indicates standard Python practices. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code does not contain obfuscation, unnecessary dynamic execution, or hidden behaviors. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical for Python projects. No suspicious hardcoded secrets or malicious logic was identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a normal, benign Python module without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
