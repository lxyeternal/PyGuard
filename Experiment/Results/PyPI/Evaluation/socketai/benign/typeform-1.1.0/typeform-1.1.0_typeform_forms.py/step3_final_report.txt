{
  "purpose": "A client wrapper for the Typeform API, facilitating form management and messaging operations.",
  "sources": "Method parameters such as 'uid', 'data', 'page', 'search', 'workspaceId', and 'patch' flag; internal method calls.",
  "sinks": "The 'request' method of the 'Client' class, which sends HTTP requests with user-provided data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into 'request' method calls, forming API requests that are sent over the network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and relies on external 'Client' class.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for managing forms and messages via the Typeform API, delegating request handling to an external 'Client'. It constructs request URLs dynamically based on input parameters and passes data directly into request calls. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code's simplicity and reliance on external components suggest it is a benign API wrapper. The request parameters are derived from method inputs, which are standard for such wrappers. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign API client wrapper for Typeform, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues detected. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
