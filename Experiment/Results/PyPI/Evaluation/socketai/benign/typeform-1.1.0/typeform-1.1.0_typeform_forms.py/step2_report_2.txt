  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and assess the scores.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as an API client for managing forms/messages, with data coming from parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that 'request' is called with parameters, potentially exposing data if 'Client' is insecure.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Well justified, high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0 aligns with no malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's reasoning is sound. The code is a standard wrapper; no malware or security issues apparent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, with accurate identification.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Correctly notes that untrusted inputs flow into API requests via 'request'.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified, high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent; the code is a benign API wrapper.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's role.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Recognizes that inputs are passed into 'request' calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified, high confidence (0.9). Malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The report accurately assesses the code as a standard API client.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the classes and their methods.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes that data flows into 'request' method calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns or hidden behaviors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified, high confidence (1). Malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is solid; no malware or security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states the code's role.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Accurate about data flow into 'request'.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Justified, high confidence (1). Malware score 0.\n\n**Assessment:** The analysis is appropriate; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Analysis:** All reports agree that the code is a straightforward API client wrapper for Typeform, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- **Scores:**\n  - **Malware:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n  - **Obfuscated:** All assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n  - **Risk:** Very low, as the code only wraps API calls without processing sensitive data or executing untrusted code.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious payloads.\n- It relies on an external 'Client' class for request handling, which should be reviewed separately, but based on this code alone, there is no evidence of malicious intent.\n- The request URLs and parameters are constructed from method inputs, typical for API wrappers, with no suspicious behavior.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, standard API wrapper, no security risks detected)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears safe, legitimate, and free of malicious or obfuscated content.",
