  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a client interface for Typeform API, reading parameters from method inputs.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Properly notes that the 'request' method of the 'Client' class is the sink, passing untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code. The code is straightforward and relies on an external 'Client' class.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 — Slightly elevated, perhaps due to the potential risk of untrusted input being sent over network, but overall low.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar analysis, emphasizing that the 'request' method is the sink and that inputs flow into API calls.\n- No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.\n- Correctly notes the code is a benign wrapper.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 — Slightly lower, reflecting minimal risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Reiterates that the code is a straightforward API wrapper, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- Emphasizes reliance on external 'Client' class.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.2 — Slightly higher, but still low.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar conclusion: no malicious code, no hardcoded secrets, straightforward request forwarding.\n- Confirms benign nature.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0.1 — Reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Also confirms that the code is a typical API client wrapper, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n- No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- SecurityRisk: 0 — Zero, indicating minimal risk.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, matching the straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the inherent risk in passing untrusted input over network requests, but overall low.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code is a standard API wrapper with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes needed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — minimal, considering external request handling and input passing.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears safe, with scores accurately reflecting its benign nature.",
