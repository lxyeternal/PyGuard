  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports systematically.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if reported issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response data. Since the raw_response is empty, there's no concrete evidence of vulnerabilities, errors, or malicious activity in the code snippets or their outputs.\n- The code appears to be a set of utility functions for URL building and dictionary cleaning, with no network calls, external code execution, or suspicious behaviors evident from the code itself.\n\n**Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic, reasoning, or summary**\n\n- The reports lack detailed information about what was tested, what responses were received, or how the code behaved during execution.\n- The only commonality is \"Empty response,\" which could mean the tests did not produce any output or the server responded with an empty payload.\n- Without raw_response data, it’s impossible to verify if the code caused any issues or if the responses are relevant to security concerns.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to each issue**\n\n- Since no specific scores are provided in the reports, and all reports are identical in their minimal data, I cannot assess the appropriateness of any scores assigned.\n- If scores were assigned, they should be based on concrete evidence of vulnerabilities, which is absent here.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- Given the lack of evidence, a high risk score (above 0.5) would be unjustified.\n- The code does not perform any dangerous operations like executing external code, handling untrusted input insecurely, or transmitting sensitive data.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate malware score**\n\n- The code is purely utility functions for URL construction and dictionary processing.\n- No malicious behavior (e.g., data exfiltration, code injection, backdoors) is apparent.\n- Therefore, malware score should be very low or zero.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge assumptions about vulnerabilities**\n\n- Any assumptions that this code is vulnerable would need concrete evidence, such as injection points, data leaks, or malicious payloads.\n- None of these are present in the provided information.\n\n**Step 7: Check score consistency**\n\n- Since no specific scores are given, I recommend maintaining low scores for malware and risk, given the lack of evidence.\n- The obfuscation score is also likely low, as the code is straightforward.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The functions seem logically correct for their intended purpose.\n- **Security concerns:** None evident based on the provided data.\n- **Malware score:** Should be **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should be **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Should be **0** or very close to it, given no evidence of issues.\n\n---\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The \"Empty response\" reports do not provide actionable information.\n- For a more thorough review, actual responses, inputs, or observed behaviors would be necessary.\n- The code itself does not contain vulnerabilities or malicious features.\n\n**Summary:**  \nBased on the provided code and reports, I conclude that there are no security issues or malware present. The scores should reflect that, with minimal risk and malware scores, and no indication of obfuscation or vulnerabilities.",
