  "review": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Assessment of the code:**\n\n- The provided code defines three functions:\n  - `buildUrlWithParams`: constructs a URL with query parameters.\n  - `cleanDict`: sanitizes a dictionary by converting certain types to strings suitable for URL parameters.\n  - `mergeDict`: merges two dictionaries after cleaning them.\n\n- The functions seem straightforward and do not contain obvious security vulnerabilities like code injection, command execution, or malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Matching reports to code:**\n\n- All five reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response data.\n- Since the reports don't specify any issues with the code's logic, behavior, or security, and all responses are empty, there are no apparent vulnerabilities or errors to analyze.\n\n3. **Error analysis:**\n\n- The reports seem to be placeholders or generic error messages, not detailed security incidents.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, misbehavior, or flaws in the code is provided.\n\n4. **Scores and reasoning:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Since there's no indication of malicious code or behavior, this should be very low, ideally 0.\n- **Obfuscated score:** The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation. Score should be 0.\n- **Risk score:** Given the lack of any actual issues, the risk score should also be low, around 0.\n\n5. **Potential issues in the code (not related to the reports):**\n\n- The default argument `params={}` in `buildUrlWithParams` is a common Python pitfall; mutable default arguments can lead to unexpected behavior if the function modifies the default object. However, in this case, the function does not modify `params`, so it's safe but still considered best practice to use `None` and initialize inside the function.\n- The `isinstance(x[key], (bool))` check is correct, but wrapping `bool` in a tuple is unnecessary; it should be `isinstance(x[key], bool)`.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n\n- The reports do not reveal any security issues or code flaws.\n- The code appears secure and functional for its purpose.\n- The scores assigned in the reports (which are all empty responses) should be minimal.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports do not provide any evidence of security issues or malicious activity. The code is straightforward, and the errors are just empty responses, likely indicating no real incident.\n\n**Note:** For future improvements, consider avoiding mutable default arguments and refining type checks for clarity.",
