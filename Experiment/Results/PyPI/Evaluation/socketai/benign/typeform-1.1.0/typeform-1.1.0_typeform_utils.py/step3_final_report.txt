  "purpose": "Utility functions for constructing URLs with query parameters and merging dictionaries with sanitized values.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries provided to 'buildUrlWithParams' and 'mergeDict' functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions generate URL strings; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input dictionaries are cleaned via 'cleanDict', then encoded and appended in 'buildUrlWithParams'; 'mergeDict' combines cleaned dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "Default mutable argument 'params={}' in 'buildUrlWithParams' is a best practice concern; 'isinstance(x[key], (bool))' unnecessarily uses a tuple.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward URL and dictionary handling with no network or external code execution. Reports indicate 'Empty response' with no raw data, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The functions correctly handle boolean and list conversions. The mutable default argument is a minor issue but not security-related. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected. The absence of concrete response data prevents any risk or malware scoring above zero. Overall, the code appears safe and correct, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is secure, correct, and free of malicious behavior. The reports lack evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The minimal risk and malware scores are justified; no obfuscation or security issues are present.",
