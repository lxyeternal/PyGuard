  "review": "Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Assessment of the reported issues:**\n   - All reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response content.\n   - There is no detailed description of specific vulnerabilities, errors, or malicious activity.\n   - The reports do not provide evidence of code execution, malicious payloads, or security flaws.\n\n2. **Verification of code correctness and security implications:**\n   - The code appears to be a utility for URL building and parameter sanitization.\n   - The `buildUrlWithParams` function correctly encodes parameters and appends them to the URL.\n   - The `cleanDict` function converts boolean values to 'true'/'false' strings and joins list values with commas.\n   - The `mergeDict` function combines two dictionaries after cleaning them.\n\n3. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic or reasoning:**\n   - The reports do not specify any particular vulnerability, bug, or malicious behavior.\n   - Since the raw responses are empty, there's no evidence of actual issues.\n   - The reports seem to be placeholders or incomplete, lacking context.\n\n4. **Scores and their reasonableness:**\n   - No scores are provided in the reports, only the \"error\" message.\n   - Given the lack of evidence, assigning any high malware or risk scores would be unjustified.\n   - The code itself, based on the provided snippet, does not exhibit malicious behavior or security flaws.\n\n5. **Potential vulnerabilities or assumptions:**\n   - The code handles URL parameters safely in terms of encoding.\n   - No user input validation beyond encoding is performed, but that’s typical for URL building.\n   - No injection or code execution risks are apparent here.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report:**\n   - Since no scores are given, I see no reason to adjust any hypothetical scores.\n   - The absence of evidence suggests low or zero scores for malware, obfuscated code, or overall risk.\n\n7. **Final assessment:**\n   - The reports do not provide concrete evidence of security issues.\n   - The code appears correct and safe in the context provided.\n   - The \"Empty response\" indicates incomplete reporting or missing details.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, due to lack of context; primarily default low risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports do not reveal any actual security incident or vulnerability. They lack details, and the code snippet appears secure and correct. No changes to scores are necessary based on the available information.",
