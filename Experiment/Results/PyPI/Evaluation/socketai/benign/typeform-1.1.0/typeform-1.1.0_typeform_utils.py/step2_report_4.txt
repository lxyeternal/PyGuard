  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if reported issues are present in the code**\n\n- All reports indicate \"Empty response\" with no raw response content. Since the code provided is a set of utility functions for URL building and dictionary cleaning, and no actual network or response handling is shown, the reports do not provide concrete evidence of issues in the code.\n- Therefore, based on the information, there is no evidence of bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity in the code itself.\n\n**Step 2: Review the code for potential issues**\n\n- The functions seem straightforward:\n  - `buildUrlWithParams`: builds a URL with query parameters.\n  - `cleanDict`: sanitizes the dictionary by converting lists to comma-separated strings, booleans to 'true'/'false', and leaving other types as-is.\n  - `mergeDict`: merges two dictionaries after cleaning them.\n\n- Potential issues:\n  - Default mutable argument `params={}` in `buildUrlWithParams` is a common Python pitfall. It can lead to unexpected behavior if the default is modified. However, this is not a security vulnerability, just a best practice concern.\n  - The `cleanDict` function handles booleans explicitly, which is good.\n  - No apparent code injection or malicious behavior.\n\n**Step 3: Review report scores and reasoning**\n\n- The reports only mention \"Empty response\" with no further details.\n- Since no actual response data or network activity is provided, there is no basis to assign a malware, obfuscated, or risk score.\n- The reports seem to be placeholders or incomplete, not indicating real issues.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores**\n\n- Without evidence of vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or obfuscation, the risk score should be **0**.\n- Malware score should be **0**; no malicious activity is indicated.\n- Obfuscated code score should be **0**; the code is straightforward.\n- Overall risk score should be **0**.\n\n**Step 5: Final assessment**\n\n- The code appears correct and safe.\n- The reports lack details, so they do not justify any concern.\n- No modifications or warnings are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n- **Code correctness:** No issues identified.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe and does not exhibit any malicious or vulnerable behavior based on the provided information.",
