  "review": "Let's analyze this step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if reported issues are present in the code**\n\n- The reports all mention \"Empty response\" with no raw response content.\n- Since the raw_response is empty for all reports, there's no concrete evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or code flaws from the provided data.\n- The code itself appears to be a straightforward URL parameter builder, with functions to clean dictionaries and merge them.\n\n**Step 2: Check for issues in the code**\n\n- The functions seem correct in their logic:\n  - `buildUrlWithParams` correctly encodes parameters and appends them if not empty.\n  - `cleanDict` properly filters out `None` values, converts lists to comma-separated strings, and booleans to 'true'/'false'.\n  - `mergeDict` combines two dictionaries after cleaning.\n\n- **Potential issues:**\n  - Default mutable argument `params={}` in `buildUrlWithParams` can lead to unexpected behavior if the function is called multiple times without specifying `params`. It should be `params=None` with a default of `None`.\n  - The `isinstance(x[key], (bool))` check is correct, but wrapping `bool` in a tuple is unnecessary; it should be `isinstance(x[key], bool)`.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores and their reasonableness**\n\n- Since no actual vulnerabilities or malicious activities are evidenced in the raw responses, the malware score should be very low or zero.\n- The obfuscated score is also likely zero, as there's no indication of obfuscation.\n- The risk score should be low, given the lack of evidence.\n\n**Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5**\n\n- No evidence suggests any serious risk or malicious activity.\n- The only concern is the mutable default argument, which is a coding best practice issue but not a security vulnerability.\n\n**Step 5: Challenge assumptions and verify consistency**\n\n- The reports are empty; thus, no vulnerabilities or malware are demonstrated.\n- The code, as provided, does not perform any malicious actions.\n- The potential issues are coding style and best practices, not security flaws.\n\n**Step 6: Final assessment**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (minor coding issue but not security-related)\n\n---\n\n### Summary of my findings:\n\n- The reports lack raw data to substantiate any security concerns.\n- The code is generally correct but has minor best practice issues (mutable default argument, unnecessary tuple in `isinstance`).\n- No evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n- The scores should reflect the absence of security issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- Adjust `buildUrlWithParams` to avoid mutable default argument:\n  ```python\n  def buildUrlWithParams(url: str, params=None) -> str:\n      if params is None:\n          params = {}\n      ...\n  ```\n- Correct `isinstance(x[key], (bool))` to `isinstance(x[key], bool)` for clarity.\n\n**Overall, the security risk is minimal based on the provided data.**",
