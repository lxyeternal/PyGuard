  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for Python package using setuptools and SCM for versioning.",
  "sources": "Importing 'setup' from 'setuptools', calling setup(use_scm_version=True).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration relying on setuptools and SCM for versioning. It involves no external inputs, no data processing, and no malicious or suspicious logic. The reliance on 'use_scm_version=True' is common practice and does not introduce security risks. The code's simplicity and clarity indicate no obfuscation or malicious intent. All reports correctly assess the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and risk scores of 0 or near-zero, consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature. No modifications are necessary.",
