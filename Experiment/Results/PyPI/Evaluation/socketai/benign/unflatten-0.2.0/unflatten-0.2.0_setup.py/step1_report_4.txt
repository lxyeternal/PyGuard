  "purpose": "To configure the package setup process using setuptools, enabling version management via SCM (Source Control Management).",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools module, and the setup function call.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data processing, user input, or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code does not process data or pass data between sources and sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Usage of 'use_scm_version=True' indicates reliance on SCM for versioning, but no explicit malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with 'use_scm_version=True', which is a standard way to manage versioning via SCM tools like git. There are no apparent malicious actions, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving a typical package configuration purpose. No suspicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script configuring version management via SCM with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and typical for open-source Python packaging.",
