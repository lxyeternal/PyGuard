  "purpose": "Configure package setup using setuptools with versioning handled by SCM (Source Control Management).",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, usage of setup() function with use_scm_version parameter.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; setup process may invoke external version control commands, but not directly shown in code.",
  "flows": "Import -> setup() with SCM versioning -> package build process.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; the code is straightforward. However, reliance on SCM for versioning could involve external commands, but this is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls the setup() function with the parameter use_scm_version=True, which indicates that versioning is managed via SCM tools like Git. This is a common pattern for dynamic versioning. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or unusual logic. The code is minimal and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for Python packaging that utilizes SCM for version management. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risks in this code fragment.",
