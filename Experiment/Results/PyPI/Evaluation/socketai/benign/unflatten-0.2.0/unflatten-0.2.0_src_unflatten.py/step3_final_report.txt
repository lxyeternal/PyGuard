{
  "purpose": "Unflatten nested dict/array data from flattened key-value pairs, reconstructing nested structures based on dot notation and bracket indices.",
  "sources": "Keys in input data (dict or sequence of pairs), accessed via iteration and regex parsing.",
  "sinks": "In-memory data structures; no external data transmission or system calls.",
  "flows": "Keys are parsed into parts; data is stored in holder objects; conflicts are checked; final nested structure is assembled.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code, no external system interactions. Input validation relies on string keys; potential for malformed keys but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses regex to parse keys, distinguishes between dict and list structures, and manages data via custom holder classes. It handles conflicts and missing keys appropriately. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation detected. The logic is straightforward and well-structured, with standard error handling. No malicious patterns or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for unflattening nested data structures. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate but can be refined to reflect zero risk and obfuscation, given the benign nature of the code.",
