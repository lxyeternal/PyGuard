  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, logical consistency, and the scoring of malware, obfuscation, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer finds no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The code is a standard unflattening utility.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Justification:** The code performs data parsing and restructuring without external interactions or suspicious behavior. The detailed reasoning supports the low scores.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the review finds no malicious intent or obfuscation. The code manipulates data structures securely.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1  \n- **Justification:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) possibly due to cautious default, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity are identified.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem consistent with the analysis. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the review confirms the code's benign nature, focusing on data transformation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior or vulnerabilities detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** The reviewer emphasizes the straightforward, benign nature of the code, with no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar conclusion—safe, standard data manipulation code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.  \n- **Justification:** No external system calls, no obfuscation, no malicious logic.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the clear, straightforward code.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, reflecting minimal concern, which is appropriate given the benign analysis.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0 or very close to it (e.g., 0.0 to 0.1), since no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports' assessments and scores are consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary. The code is a legitimate, safe utility for unflattening nested data structures, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.",
