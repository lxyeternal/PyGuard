{
  "purpose": "Defines constants related to the Language Server Protocol for use in language server implementations.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; the code contains only constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or input-output flows; the code only assigns static constant values.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns observed. The code consists solely of constant class definitions with hardcoded values.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several classes with integer constants representing protocol-specific types, such as completion kinds, diagnostic severities, message types, etc. All classes contain static constant attributes with fixed integer values. There is no dynamic code execution, input handling, or data processing. The structure and content are consistent with standard protocol constant definitions, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious logic, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of constant definitions for a language server protocol, with no malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks. It appears to be a benign component intended for use as a protocol specification or library.",
