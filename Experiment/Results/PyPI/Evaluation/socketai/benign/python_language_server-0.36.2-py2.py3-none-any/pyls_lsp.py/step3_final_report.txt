  "purpose": "Defines static constants for Language Server Protocol message types, kinds, severities, and related enums for use as reference or in protocol implementations.",
  "sources": "Class attributes with static integer assignments representing protocol message types and categories.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process input or data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is static definitions without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static class definitions with no obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class definitions containing integer constants for various LSP message types and categories. No functions, input/output, external data handling, or dynamic code are present. The code serves as a static reference or enumeration. All provided reports correctly identify the benign, static nature of the code, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores are all appropriately set to 0, and confidence is high. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The code is standard, well-structured, and aligns with typical protocol definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static set of constants defining Language Server Protocol message types and categories. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risk. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
