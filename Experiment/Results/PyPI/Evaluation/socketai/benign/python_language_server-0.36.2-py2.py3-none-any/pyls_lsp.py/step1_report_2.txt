  "purpose": "Define constants for Language Server Protocol (LSP) components and message types.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded class attributes and constant definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data outputs.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from source to sink is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of static constant definitions with no dynamic or reflective code, no external input handling, and no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of constant definitions for various LSP-related enums and types. It contains no functions, no data processing, no dynamic execution, nor external data sources or sinks. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The constants serve as protocol identifiers and are typical in such implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign set of constant definitions for the Language Server Protocol. It presents no security risks, no malicious intent, and no suspicious behavior. It is standard protocol-related code with no indicators of malware or security issues.",
