  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports consistently describe the code as static constant definitions for Language Server Protocol (LSP) message types and related enums.\n- No dynamic code, input/output handling, external data processing, or obfuscation is mentioned.\n- The reports unanimously conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis that there's no malicious intent.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is consistent with the straightforward static nature of the code.\n- The confidence level is 1 in all reports, indicating high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n**Potential Issues or Discrepancies:**\n- The code itself is simple and static; no issues are identified.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0) seem appropriate given the nature of the code.\n- The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors, which aligns with the code's purpose.\n\n**Any points to challenge or reconsider?**\n- Since the code is purely constant definitions, there is no basis for assigning any risk or malware scores above zero.\n- The reasoning is sound; no assumptions about vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- The code is benign and safe.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear static definitions)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a standard, safe set of protocol constants with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
