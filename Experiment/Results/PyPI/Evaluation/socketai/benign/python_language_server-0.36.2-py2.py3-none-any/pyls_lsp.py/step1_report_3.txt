  "purpose": "Define constants for Language Server Protocol (LSP) message types, severity levels, and related enums for use in a language server implementation.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains class definitions with static constant assignments.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, well-structured constant definitions without dynamic code execution or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions assigning integer constants to various language server protocol message types and categories. It lacks any input reading, data processing, or external data transmission. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The content appears to be standard, documented constants likely derived from protocol specifications. No indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple collection of protocol constants with no malicious intent or security issues. It serves as a static reference for a language server implementation and contains no risky or suspicious elements.",
