  "purpose": "Defines constants for Language Server Protocol (LSP) message types and kinds",
  "sources": "Constant assignments within class definitions",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing or external data handling present",
  "flows": "None; the code solely defines static constant values",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward constant definitions, no dynamic code, no obfuscated elements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with static integer constants representing various LSP message types and kinds. There are no functions, input/output operations, external data processing, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to serve as a static reference for LSP constants, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign set of constant definitions for LSP message types and related enumerations. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks.",
