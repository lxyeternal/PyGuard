  "purpose": "Define constants related to the Language Server Protocol for use in a language server implementation.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading; the code contains only static class definitions and constant assignments.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or untrusted data handling present; no sinks related to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as the code consists solely of constant definitions without functions or dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, well-structured, and contains no suspicious constructs or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several classes containing constant values for language server protocol features, such as completion item kinds, diagnostic severities, message types, etc. It includes only static constant assignments with no data processing, input handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or hidden code. The code is typical for a protocol constants module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of constant definitions for language server protocol implementation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe module.",
