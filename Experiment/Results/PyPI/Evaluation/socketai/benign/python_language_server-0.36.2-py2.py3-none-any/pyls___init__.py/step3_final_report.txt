  "purpose": "Set up plugin markers, environment detection, and version retrieval for a Python plugin system.",
  "sources": "Import statements, sys.version_info, os.name, get_versions() call",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data handling present",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows; code initializes environment and plugin markers only",
  "anomalies": "None; standard setup code with no suspicious patterns or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection, retrieves version info, and defines plugin markers using standard libraries. It handles Python 2 compatibility with future imports and cleans up namespace with 'del get_versions'. No external data, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard plugin system setup script with no security risks or malicious behavior. All signals indicate a safe, well-understood pattern.",
