{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a Python plugin system, manages versioning, and sets environment-specific variables.",
  "sources": "os.name, sys.version_info, get_versions() from _version module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data writes are present",
  "flows": "Data flows from version retrieval and environment detection to setting variables, with no external or user input involved",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and a local version module, performs a Python version check for compatibility, and sets up plugin markers using the pluggy library. It determines the operating system and defines constants for plugin management. No input validation, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are present. All code appears standard for plugin initialization and environment setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a plugin-based Python project with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
