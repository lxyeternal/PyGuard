  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a legitimate component of a Python language server, with no signs of sabotage, malware, or malicious intent. The use of Jedi for static analysis introduces a known, inherent risk when analyzing untrusted source code, but this does not indicate malicious behavior. The scores and assessments are appropriate and justified."
