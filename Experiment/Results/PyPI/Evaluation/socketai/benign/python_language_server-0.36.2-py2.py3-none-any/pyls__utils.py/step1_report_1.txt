{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for file path handling, debounce implementation, process checking, and code analysis support for Python projects.",
  "sources": "os.path.commonprefix, os.path.exists, os.path.dirname, os.path.splitext, pathlib.Path, os.kill, sys.version_info, jedi.__version__, inspect.getcallargs",
  "sinks": "None of the functions directly write to external systems or handle untrusted input in a way that leads to data leaks or system compromise. The process checks on Windows and Unix are safe system calls.",
  "flows": "N/A – no untrusted data flows to dangerous sinks; the code primarily processes local file paths and system process status.",
  "anomalies": "The `is_process_alive` function on Windows uses ctypes to directly call Windows API, which is standard for such checks. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors observed. The code appears standard for a utility library.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises utility functions related to file path handling, process checks, and code analysis support. It includes standard library imports, platform-specific process checking methods, and path manipulations. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present. The process checking functions use system APIs correctly, and there are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The functions do not handle untrusted input insecurely or execute untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility library without malicious intent or security risks. It performs file system operations, process checks, and path manipulations with proper safety considerations. No malware or suspicious activity detected.",
