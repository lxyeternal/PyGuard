  "purpose": "Utility functions for path handling, process monitoring, code analysis support, and system interactions.",
  "sources": "os.path operations, sys.version_info, environment variables, platform-specific process checks, input parameters for functions",
  "sinks": "None identified; functions do not process untrusted data or perform data leaks or network activity",
  "flows": "Standard data flow within utility functions; no external untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward implementation of system calls and path manipulations",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions for path resolution, process checking, string manipulation, and code analysis support. It uses platform-specific system calls safely, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The functions are well-structured, with no suspicious data flows or backdoors. The use of threading, system APIs, and path operations aligns with typical utility code, and no untrusted data handling or network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility library with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
