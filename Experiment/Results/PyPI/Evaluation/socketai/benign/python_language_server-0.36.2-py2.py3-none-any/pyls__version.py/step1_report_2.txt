{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to generate version information for a package, likely for version tracking and distribution purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the hardcoded JSON string 'version_json' defined within the script.",
  "targets": "The json.loads() function processes the hardcoded JSON string; no untrusted input is involved.",
  "flows": "The static JSON string is loaded into a Python dictionary via json.loads() without external data sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code patterns, no obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The JSON string is static and does not contain any embedded or hidden code.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward: it defines a JSON string with version info and a function to parse it. No dynamic code execution, no external data sources, and no suspicious operations are present. The code appears purely for version information retrieval, with no malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, purely for version reporting, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
