  "purpose": "Defines a configuration source class for pycodestyle plugin settings, reading configurations from user and project files.",
  "sources": "Imports from pycodestyle, pyls._utils, and local source module; reads configuration files (user configs, project configs).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; purely configuration parsing.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from files read by read_config_from_files to parse_config; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, defines constants, and a class for configuration management. The class reads configuration files from user and project locations, parsing options for the plugin. No suspicious or malicious behavior, no code injection, data leakage, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration handler for a plugin, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
