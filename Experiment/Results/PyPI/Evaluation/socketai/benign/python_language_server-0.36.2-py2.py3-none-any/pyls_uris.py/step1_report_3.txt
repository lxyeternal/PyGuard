{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for parsing, constructing, and converting URIs and filesystem paths, primarily for URI manipulation and normalization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (URIs and paths) and the IS_WIN platform variable.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs manipulated URI strings and filesystem paths, which could be used insecurely if misused, but no external sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input URIs are parsed and possibly transformed into filesystem paths; filesystem paths are normalized and converted back to URIs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic for URI/path handling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs URI parsing, encoding, decoding, and normalization with consideration for Windows-specific paths and UNC paths. It avoids common pitfalls such as incorrect encoding of Windows drive letters. No external network or system modification is involved. It operates purely on input parameters with standard functions. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for URI and filesystem path handling with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It correctly handles platform-specific path normalization and encoding/decoding processes. The overall security risk score is low.",
