  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate; describes URI utilities correctly.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous sinks; standard parsing and normalization.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious activity; code is straightforward.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard utility code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0 — consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the code's behavior. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No direct data leaks or malicious sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct; low security risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** The slight risk score (0.2) accounts for potential misuse but is still low. Justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external or unsafe sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns; standard handling.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with code behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correct.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or secrets.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 — justified.\n\n**Assessment:** The low risk score matches the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dangerous sinks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct. The code performs only URI/path normalization and handling, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports correctly identify no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** The majority are very low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security risk. Given the code's nature, this is appropriate.\n\n### Final Personal Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — the code is benign.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — straightforward logic.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, as it handles only URI/path normalization without external effects.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent with the code's behavior. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the analysis.\n\n**Recommendations:** No changes needed. The code appears safe and well-structured for its utility purpose.",
