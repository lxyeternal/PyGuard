  "purpose": "Implementation of a Python Language Server Protocol (LSP) server handling JSON-RPC communication, workspace management, and plugin hooks.",
  "sources": "Network sockets, JSON-RPC streams, method parameters, configuration files, environment variables",
  "sinks": "Hook invocations, workspace updates, document management, configuration updates, threading operations",
  "flows": "Data flows from network streams into JSON-RPC handlers, through plugin hooks, into workspace and document methods, and back to clients",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of a Python language server, utilizing threading, socketserver, dynamic class creation, and plugin hooks. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The server manages documents, responds to LSP requests, and monitors parent process health in a typical manner. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the code's structure and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Python language server with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal and justified by the server's network exposure, but no active threats or vulnerabilities are evident.",
