  "purpose": "Define hook specifications for a Python Language Server (pyls) plugin architecture.",
  "sources": "The code does not read external input or untrusted data; it primarily defines function signatures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or execute potentially malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only declares function signatures without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward interface definition with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of function definitions decorated with @hookspec, serving as interface contracts for a Python language server. There are no implementation details, data processing, or external interactions. It does not read or process external input, nor does it contain any suspicious or malicious code segments. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior patterns are evident. The structure is standard for plugin hook specifications, and the copyright comment does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a non-malicious, standard set of hook definitions for a Python language server plugin framework. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and has no suspicious behavior.",
