{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of function signatures for a language server protocol (LSP) plugin, specifically for the pyls (Python Language Server). It is intended to declare hooks for various LSP features.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own function definitions and docstrings, as well as the imported module 'pyls' at the beginning.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks for untrusted data, user input, or network activity. The functions are all stubs with no implementation, so no data flows or processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No execution flows or data flows are present because all functions are empty placeholders.",
  "anomalies": "There are no unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated elements. The code is straightforward, primarily consisting of function definitions and comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of interface definitions (function signatures) with no actual executable logic. It imports a module 'pyls' but does not invoke or manipulate it in any way. The functions are annotated with decorators but contain only 'pass' statements, indicating they are placeholders or interface stubs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or security risks. The absence of implementation means it cannot perform any malicious actions or data leakage. The code appears to be part of a plugin API, and its simplicity reduces the likelihood of embedded malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of function signatures for a Python language server plugin interface. It does not contain executable logic, data flows, or any suspicious code. It shows no signs of malware, sabotage, or security risks. The code is safe based on the provided snippet.",
