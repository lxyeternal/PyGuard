  "purpose": "Define hookspec functions for a Python Language Server (pyls) plugin system.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; functions are placeholders for plugin hooks.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or data sinks; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No active data flows; functions are stubs with no implementation.",
  "anomalies": "All functions are empty and contain only pass statements; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of stub function definitions with no executable logic, no data handling, and no external interactions. It appears to be part of a plugin API specification, not operational code. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The absence of actual logic, data manipulation, or network activity indicates this code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a set of placeholder function definitions for a Python language server plugin system. It contains no executable code, no data flows, and no malicious elements. It is safe and not suspicious.",
