  "purpose": "Defines interface functions for pyls.",
  "sources": "Function decorators (@hookspec) and function signatures with 'pass' statements.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; functions are stubs with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward interface definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of decorated function signatures serving as plugin hook specifications. All functions are placeholders with no implementation, data handling, or external calls. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The import of 'pyls' is static and unused beyond the interface declaration. The code's purpose is to define extension points for a plugin system, not to execute logic or process data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely structural, and poses no security risks or malicious intent. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
