  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is a set of function signatures (stubs) with no implementation.\n- No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is evident.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- The code is primarily defining plugin hook interfaces for the Python Language Server (pyls).\n- The import of 'pyls' module is static and not used in any malicious way.\n- The purpose is clearly to declare extension points, not to perform logic or data processing.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on code presence and behavior:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  **Yes.** The code matches the description: function signatures, decorators, no implementation, no data flow.\n\n- **Are there any errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  **No.** The reports correctly identify that these are interface definitions with no executable logic.\n\n- **Are the scores (malware, obfuscated, security risk) reasonable?**  \n  **Yes.** All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- **Malware score justification:**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, which is justified. The code does not perform any malicious activity, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code.\n\n- **Obfuscated code:**  \n  All reports assign obfuscated = 0, consistent with the straightforward, clear function signatures.\n\n- **Security risk:**  \n  All reports assign securityRisk = 0, which is accurate since no data flows, no external commands, no secrets.\n\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n  No report claims any vulnerabilities based on assumptions; they all correctly note the lack of implementation and data handling.\n\n---\n\n### Critical review and final assessment:\n\n- The code is purely interface/stub definitions for plugin hooks.  \n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent.  \n- The absence of implementation prevents any malicious activity.  \n- The code's purpose is to define extension points, which is common in plugin architectures.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the provided code and reports, the code is benign, safe, and correctly scored.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Overall malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese align with the reports' assessments and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, non-malicious set of plugin interface definitions with no executable logic, data flows, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
