{
  "purpose": "Define a set of plugin hook specifications for a Python Language Server (pyls) extension.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs; the code only declares function signatures and imports.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no execution of external commands or data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; functions are placeholders with no implementations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements and function definitions decorated with @hookspec. These functions serve as extension points for a language server. They are empty and contain no executable logic, external data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The presence of a copyright comment and the use of a third-party library (pyls) are standard and not suspicious. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward set of hook specifications for a plugin system in a Python language server. There are no indications of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
