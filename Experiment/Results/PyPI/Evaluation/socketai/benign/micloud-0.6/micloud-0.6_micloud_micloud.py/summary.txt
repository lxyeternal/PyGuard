  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Xiaomi cloud client with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The slightly elevated risk score (0.2) accounts for the security concern of logging sensitive tokens, which should be addressed in production. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use."
