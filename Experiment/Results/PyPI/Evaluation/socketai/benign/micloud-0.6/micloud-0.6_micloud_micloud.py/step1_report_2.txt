  "purpose": "This library handles login, session management, and device data retrieval from Xiaomi Cloud services.",
  "sources": "User inputs: username and password; network requests to Xiaomi servers; cookies and response data from server responses.",
  "sinks": "Network requests sending login credentials and session data; handling of cookies containing sensitive info; potential storage of device info in files.",
  "flows": "Credentials from input -> login request -> session establishment -> device data requests -> response handling and potential storage.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected; use of standard cryptographic hashes; no obfuscated code or misleading variables. The code securely manages session tokens and cookies. No suspicious network connections or data leaks identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard login procedures, managing session and cookies, making network requests to Xiaomi's API, and retrieving device info. It uses secure hashing for passwords and manages session cleanup properly. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized data access are present. The code does store device info in a JSON file but does not appear to leak or transmit data maliciously. The network requests include token handling and session resets. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious external calls are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation for Xiaomi Cloud login and device management. There are no indications of malware, malicious data exfiltration, or security risks. The overall security risk score is low.",
