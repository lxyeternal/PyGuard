  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**General observations about the code:**\n- It is a standard Python package setup script.\n- It conditionally imports setup from setuptools or distutils.\n- It defines static metadata, dependencies, and an entry point.\n- All data appears hardcoded and typical for such scripts.\n- No dynamic data, user input, or external data fetching occurs.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** No malicious intent, standard setup script.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup configuration.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; straightforward setup script.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Again, standard package setup.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** Standard setup script, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports consistently conclude that the code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. Their malware scores are all 0, obfuscated scores are 0, and security risks are 0, which aligns with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0**, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should stay at **0**, given the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** Should be **0**, reflecting no security risks.\n\n**Overall:** The code is a typical setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** No changes are necessary; the reports are accurate and consistent with the code.",
