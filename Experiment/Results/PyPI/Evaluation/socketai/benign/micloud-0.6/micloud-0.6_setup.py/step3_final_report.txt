  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for configuring package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry point.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata fields such as name, version, author, URL, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input processed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a conventional setup script that conditionally imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' or 'distutils.core' and calls 'setup()' with static, hardcoded metadata. It does not process user input, fetch external data, or execute dynamic code. All dependencies are common packages, and the script serves solely to configure package installation. No suspicious behaviors, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The code's simplicity and static nature support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify it as such, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No modifications are necessary.",
