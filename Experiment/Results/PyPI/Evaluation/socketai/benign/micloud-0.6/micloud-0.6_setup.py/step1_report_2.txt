  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the 'micloud' Python package, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Static code defining package metadata, imports, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; setup script does not process user input or data at runtime.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the script only defines package metadata and dependencies without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior. The entry point suggests CLI usage but does not show malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import setup functions from setuptools, falling back to distutils if unavailable. It defines package metadata such as name, version, author, dependencies, and an entry point for a CLI tool. All content is typical for a Python package setup script. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, and no dynamic code execution are present. The dependencies listed are common for such a package and do not indicate malicious intent. The script is standard and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate package installer script for the 'micloud' library.",
