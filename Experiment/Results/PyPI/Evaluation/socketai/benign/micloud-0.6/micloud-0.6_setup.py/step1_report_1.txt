{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for the 'micloud' Python package, defining its metadata and dependencies for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads package dependencies ('install_requires'), metadata fields ('name', 'version', etc.), and imports setup functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the script does not process untrusted data or execute code based on external input.",
  "flows": "The script initializes package setup with predefined metadata; no dynamic data flow or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard setup patterns; no hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscated parts.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports setup functions, then calls setup() with static metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All data appears to be hardcoded or predefined, typical of a package setup script. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling. It adheres to common Python packaging practices without any obfuscation or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines package metadata and dependencies for distribution. There is no evidence of malware, data leaks, or malicious behavior.",
