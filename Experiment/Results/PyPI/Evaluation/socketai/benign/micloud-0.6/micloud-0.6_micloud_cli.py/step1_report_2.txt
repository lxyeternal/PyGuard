  "purpose": "Command-line tool for interacting with Xiaomi Cloud and MIOT specifications.",
  "sources": "Input prompts for username, password, and command-line arguments for URNs, types, and status.",
  "sinks": "Json serialization and echo outputs; no direct untrusted data sinks are evident outside data retrieval functions.",
  "flows": "User input (credentials, URNs, types) flows into function calls; outputs are printed as JSON, no transformation on inputs before output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious or unusual code constructs; no obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily provides CLI commands to fetch device info and specifications from Xiaomi Cloud. Inputs are taken via prompts or command-line arguments, then used to call external APIs through imported classes (MiCloud, MiotSpec). The data returned from these functions is serialized and printed. No untrusted data is executed or transmitted maliciously; no suspicious patterns like network exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present. No hardcoded secrets are detected. The code structure is straightforward and does not invoke any risky dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard CLI wrapper for Xiaomi cloud data retrieval functions. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks based on the provided code. It appears to be a legitimate tool with no suspicious elements.",
