  "purpose": "Import the MiCloud class from a local module named 'micloud'.",
  "sources": "Import statement indicating the code reads a module 'micloud' and accesses the MiCloud class within it.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not include data output, network communication, or other sink operations.",
  "flows": "The source is the import statement; there are no flows to sinks since no further code is provided.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports a class from a local module, which is a common practice. No data handling, network activity, or complex logic is present. Without additional context, no malicious activity can be inferred. The import could be part of a larger legitimate application or module.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this minimal code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior. It appears to be a simple import statement. No malware or security risks are detectable from this fragment.",
