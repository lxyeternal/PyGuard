  "purpose": "Importing the MiCloud class from a local module named micloud",
  "sources": "The code imports a class from a relative module within the package",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only performs an import operation",
  "anomalies": "Lack of additional code or context makes it difficult to determine malicious intent; no suspicious patterns visible in this line alone",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple import statement, which is common in modular Python code. Without additional context, it does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security issues. It references a local module, and no external data or input handling is present here.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no signs of malicious activity or security risks. This appears to be a standard import in a Python project.",
