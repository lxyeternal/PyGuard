  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SDK for Xiaomi Cloud interaction, with cryptographic practices that are outdated but not malicious. There is no evidence of supply chain sabotage, malware, or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. The low malware score and obfuscated score are justified; the risk score reflects cryptography concerns but not active threats."
