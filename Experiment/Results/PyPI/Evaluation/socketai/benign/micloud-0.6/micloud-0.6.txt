There is no evidence of supply chain sabotage, malware, or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior. The low malware score and obfuscated score are justified; the risk score reflects cryptography concerns but not active threats."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign CLI utility for Xiaomi device and cloud data access. No malware, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The low security risk score (~0.2) is appropriate, primarily due to reliance on external modules whose security is outside this code's scope."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API wrapper for miot-spec.org, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external data trustworthiness, which is outside the code's scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, justified by the external data dependency but no internal vulnerabilities."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Xiaomi cloud client with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. The slightly elevated risk score (0.2) accounts for the security concern of logging sensitive tokens, which should be addressed in production. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for use."
