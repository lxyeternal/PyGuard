  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API wrapper for miot-spec.org, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external data trustworthiness, which is outside the code's scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, justified by the external data dependency but no internal vulnerabilities."
