  "purpose": "A Python class providing methods to interact with the miot-spec.org web service, fetching device specifications, schemas, and standard types via HTTP requests.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET requests to 'https://miot-spec.org/miot-spec-v2' endpoints, with parameters validated within methods.",
  "sinks": "Response JSON data parsed directly; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "Parameters (status, device_urn, type_) flow into URL construction, then responses are parsed via response.json().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client wrapper with proper parameter validation, session management, and error handling. It interacts with a trusted external service and does not perform any malicious actions or obfuscation. The response data is parsed without further processing that could introduce risks. Overall, it exhibits standard, secure coding practices with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured API wrapper for miot-spec.org, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to external data trustworthiness, which is outside the code's scope. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the overall security risk score is approximately 0.1, justified by the external data dependency but no internal vulnerabilities.",
