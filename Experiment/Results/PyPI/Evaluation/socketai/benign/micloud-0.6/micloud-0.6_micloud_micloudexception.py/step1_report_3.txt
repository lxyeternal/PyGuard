  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for a Xiaomi Cloud login library.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class definitions with no suspicious or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two custom exception classes, each initializing with a message attribute and calling the superclass constructor. There are no external data inputs, no data processing, no network operations, and no security-sensitive actions. The structure is typical for exception definitions. No signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to be part of a larger, benign project. No malware or suspicious behavior detected.",
