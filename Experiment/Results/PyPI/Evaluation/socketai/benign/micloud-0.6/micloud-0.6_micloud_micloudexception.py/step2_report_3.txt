  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code defines two custom exception classes, `MiCloudException` and `MiCloudAccessDenied`.\n   - These classes inherit from Python's built-in `Exception` class.\n   - Each class has an `__init__` method that stores a message and calls the superclass constructor.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, network calls, or embedded secrets.\n   \n   **Conclusion:** The code matches the description in the reports and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n2. **Logical and Structural Analysis:**\n   - The classes are straightforward, standard Python exception definitions.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The purpose is clearly to handle errors related to Xiaomi cloud interactions, which is typical in such libraries.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, non-obfuscated code.\n   - **Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign, non-security-sensitive code.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that this code is purely for exception handling with no malicious intent.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are justified here, as the code is standard.\n\n5. **Consistency and Justification:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports.\n   - Given the code's simplicity and lack of external interactions, the scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk are justified.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is benign, standard exception class definitions.\n   - No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The code's purpose is typical for error handling in a larger library.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nBased on the analysis, I concur with the reports' assessments. The code is entirely benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and poses no security risk.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is straightforward, standard Python exception classes.  \n- No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior detected.  \n- Scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\nPlease let me know if further analysis is required.",
