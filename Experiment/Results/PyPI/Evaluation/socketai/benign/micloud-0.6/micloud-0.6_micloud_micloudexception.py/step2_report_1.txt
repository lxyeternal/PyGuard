  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's `Exception`. They store a message attribute and invoke the superclass constructor.\n   - There are no external data inputs, network operations, hardcoded secrets, or any suspicious constructs.\n   - The code is straightforward, standard, and benign.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Reasoning:**\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or security issues.\n   - They correctly identify that the code only defines exception classes with no data flow, no input/output, and no anomalies.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the reports.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments seem necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely definitional with no malicious behavior, scores higher than 0.5 are unwarranted.\n   - The reports' scores align with this reasoning.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is correctly set to 0 in all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately interpret the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and align with the analysis.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, harmless definition of custom exceptions.\n- No security issues, malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- Based on the code and reports, I would assign:\n  - **Malware score:** 0\n  - **Obfuscated score:** 0\n  - **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n- The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores.\n- No further action or concern is warranted.",
