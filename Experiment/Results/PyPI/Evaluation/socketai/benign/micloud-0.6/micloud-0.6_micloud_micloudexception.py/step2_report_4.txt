  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code consists solely of two simple exception class definitions, inheriting from Python's built-in `Exception`. They store a message attribute and invoke the superclass constructor. There are no external data inputs, network calls, hardcoded secrets, or other suspicious constructs.  \n   **Conclusion**: No issues or malicious code are present in this fragment.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic**:  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and contains no anomalies or suspicious behavior. They correctly identify that the code is only defining exception classes with no data flows or external interactions.  \n   **Conclusion**: The reports' reasoning is sound and consistent with the code.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign:\n   - malware: 0\n   - obfuscated: 0\n   - securityRisk: 0  \n   These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since the code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious or risky behavior, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified. All reports agree on this, assigning 0, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. There is no indication of malicious intent or behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions about Vulnerabilities**:  \n   The reports do not assume vulnerabilities; they simply analyze the code as-is. This is correct, as the code does not exhibit any vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent and justified based on the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exception classes for a Xiaomi cloud library.  \n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk behavior is present.  \n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate.\n\n**My own estimate**:  \n- **Malware score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated score**: 0  \n- **Risk score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code analysis.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is benign, with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to scores or conclusions are necessary.",
