  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to Xiaomi Cloud access.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; no input or data reading operations present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output operations observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two simple custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception class, with constructors setting a message attribute. No input handling, network operations, or data leaks are present. The code appears standard and straightforward, serving only as error handling components for a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment contains standard exception class definitions with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. It is a benign part of a larger application.",
