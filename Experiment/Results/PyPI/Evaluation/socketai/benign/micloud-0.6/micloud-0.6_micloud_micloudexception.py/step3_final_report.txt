{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for Xiaomi cloud error handling.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; exception classes are instantiated but no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, standard, and contains no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two simple exception class definitions inheriting from Python's Exception. They store a message attribute and invoke the superclass constructor. There are no external data inputs, network calls, hardcoded secrets, or embedded malicious code. The code is benign, standard, and intended for error handling within a larger Xiaomi cloud library. All review reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. The code does not exhibit any anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious or security issues. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and risk are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
