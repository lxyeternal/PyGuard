  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for errors and access denial in the Xiaomi cloud library.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or output in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines exception classes without execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward class definitions without anomalies or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception base class, used for error handling in a Xiaomi cloud login library. No external data input, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious or malicious code present. The code appears to be a standard and benign implementation of exception classes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard Python class definitions for exceptions with no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
