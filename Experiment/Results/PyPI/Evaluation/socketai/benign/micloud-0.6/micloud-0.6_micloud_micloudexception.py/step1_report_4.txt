  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for errors related to Xiaomi Cloud interactions.",
  "sources": "The code does not read any external input or data; it only defines exception classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines exception classes without data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, used to handle specific error cases in a Xiaomi Cloud library. There are no data input sources, external data processing, or suspicious behaviors. No embedded credentials, network operations, or potentially malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, defining exception classes without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior and appears safe.",
