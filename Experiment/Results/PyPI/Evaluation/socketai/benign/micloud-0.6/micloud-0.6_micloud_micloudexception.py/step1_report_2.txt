  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for a Xiaomi cloud library to handle errors and access denial scenarios.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are present in this code segment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted data processing are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output exists within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code only defines exception classes with standard constructor methods; no unusual or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, defining two custom exception classes inheriting from Python's Exception class. Both classes store a message attribute and call the superclass constructor with the message. No input reading, data processing, or external interactions are present. The structure and syntax are standard and clear. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign definition of exception classes for error handling within a Xiaomi cloud-related library. It contains no malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
