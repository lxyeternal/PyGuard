  "purpose": "Assign a version string to __version__ variable in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of __version__ variable; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data leaks, external calls, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the assignment is static and isolated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a straightforward version string assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a version string to __version__, with no input, output, data flow, or suspicious behavior. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are present. The code does not perform any operations that could pose security threats or indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted.",
