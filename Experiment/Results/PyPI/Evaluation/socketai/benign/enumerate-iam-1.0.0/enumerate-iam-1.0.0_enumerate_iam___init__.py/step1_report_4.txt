  "sinks": "No output or data sinks involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs; only a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, secrets, or unusual code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a string value to the variable '__version__'. This is a common practice for versioning Python packages and does not involve any data input, external calls, or complex logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks present in this single line.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign and standard for Python package versioning. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
