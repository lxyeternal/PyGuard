  "review": "Let's analyze these reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or suspicious operations.\n   - The code is straightforward and standard for Python packages.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n   - The confidence score is 1, which is justified.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign zero to malware and security risk, and the code is trivial, there's no justification for higher scores.\n   - No suspicious activity or vulnerabilities are present.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is correctly 0, as the code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No hidden or obfuscated malicious code is detected.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are based on straightforward, static code analysis.\n   - No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis provided.\n   - The reports uniformly indicate no issues, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Security Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\nGiven the code snippet and the reports, I concur with the scores. The code is a standard version declaration with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and no security risks.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Final Score |\n|------------------|--------------|\n| Malware          | 0            |\n| Obfuscated       | 0            |\n| Security Risk    | 0            |\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, with no security concerns. All scores are appropriate and justified.",
