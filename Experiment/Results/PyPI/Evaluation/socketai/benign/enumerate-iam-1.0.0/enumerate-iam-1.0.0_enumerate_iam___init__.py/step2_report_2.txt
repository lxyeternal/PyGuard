  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports confirm that the code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to `__version__`.\n   - No input/output, data flows, or suspicious operations are present.\n   - The code is minimal, standard, and does not contain any obfuscation or malicious logic.\n   \n   **Conclusion:** There are no issues or malicious behaviors in the code snippets themselves.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they all correctly identify the code as benign.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n   - The assessments appropriately reflect the simplicity of the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware` = 0\n     - `securityRisk` = 0\n     - `obfuscated` = 0\n   - These scores are reasonable given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a static assignment with no malicious or risky behavior, the risk score should remain at 0.\n   - No justification exists for increasing the risk score, as there's no evidence of vulnerability or malicious intent.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0.\n   - No malicious activity is present or implied.\n\n6. **Challenging Assumptions and Claims:**\n   - All claims are justified and based on the code's simplicity.\n   - No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made without evidence.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports.\n   - They accurately reflect the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n\nGiven the analysis, I agree with the existing scores. The code is a standard version declaration with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Malware            | 0      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      |\n| Security Risk      | 0      |\n\n**Final note:** No further action or concern is warranted for this code snippet.",
