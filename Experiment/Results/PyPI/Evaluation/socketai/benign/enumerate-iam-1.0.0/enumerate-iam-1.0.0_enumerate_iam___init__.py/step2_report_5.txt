  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content**: All reports confirm that the code is a simple assignment of a version string (`'1.0.0'`) to the `__version__` variable. There are no input operations, no data flows, no external data reads, and no suspicious or obfuscated code.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**: Based on the code snippet, there are no issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors. The reports uniformly agree on this point.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly identify that this is a benign, standard version declaration.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n4. **Scores Review**:\n   - All reports assign `malware: 0`, `obfuscated: 0`, and `securityRisk: 0`.\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which is reasonable given the straightforward analysis.\n\n5. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores**:\n   - Since the code is purely a static version string assignment with no malicious or suspicious activity, higher scores are unwarranted.\n   - No reason exists to assign any risk, malware, or obfuscation scores above 0.\n\n6. **Potential Assumptions or Claims**:\n   - All claims are based on direct code inspection, with no assumptions about hidden behaviors.\n   - The analysis correctly dismisses any concerns about vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment**:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0 (correct; no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0 (correct; code is straightforward)\n- **Risk Score**: 0 (correct; no security risk)\n\n**My own estimate** aligns with the reports: the code is entirely benign, with no security concerns.\n\n**Final note**: The reports are accurate and appropriately conservative. No changes are necessary.",
