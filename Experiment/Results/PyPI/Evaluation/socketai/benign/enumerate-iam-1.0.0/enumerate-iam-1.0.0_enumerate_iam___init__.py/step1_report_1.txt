  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple version assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string '1.0.0' to the __version__ variable, which is a common practice in Python packages for versioning. There are no input operations, no data processing, no external data reads, nor any suspicious or obfuscated code. The simplicity suggests this is a standard version declaration without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks. It poses no security threat.",
