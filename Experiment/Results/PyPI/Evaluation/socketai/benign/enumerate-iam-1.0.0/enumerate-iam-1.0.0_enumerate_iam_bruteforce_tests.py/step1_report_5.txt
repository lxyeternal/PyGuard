{
  "purpose": "This is a dictionary mapping AWS service names to lists of API operation names, likely used for testing or enumeration purposes in an AWS environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from predefined dictionary keys and values representing AWS service operation names.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any direct sinks; it is a static data structure with no network, file, or environment variable access.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows or dynamic execution paths; the data is static and solely used for reference or enumeration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are present. The structure is a large static dictionary listing AWS API calls; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of a static dictionary mapping AWS service names to API operation lists. No code execution, input/output, or network activity is present. The data appears to be a catalog of API calls potentially used for enumeration, testing, or tooling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leakage. It appears to be a comprehensive enumeration of AWS API methods, which could be used in legitimate testing or automation contexts. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident. The code is purely declarative with no runtime logic.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a static mapping of AWS services to API operations, with no malicious code or suspicious behavior. It appears to be used for enumeration or reference purposes and does not pose a security risk or malware threat.",
