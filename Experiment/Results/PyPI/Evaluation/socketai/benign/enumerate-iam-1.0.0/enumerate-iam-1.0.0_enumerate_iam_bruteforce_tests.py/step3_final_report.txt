{
  "purpose": "A static dictionary listing AWS API method names, likely used for testing, enumeration, or permission validation.",
  "sources": "Static data structure within the code; no external input or dynamic data.",
  "sinks": "No data transmission, no external sinks; purely static reference.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static mapping only.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code patterns; variable name 'BRUTEFORCE_TESTS' suggests testing activity but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static, comprehensive dictionary of AWS API methods. It contains no executable code, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The variable name indicates potential use in brute-force or permission enumeration testing, but the code itself is benign. All reports correctly identify the static nature, lack of malicious indicators, and assign low malware and obfuscation scores. Slightly elevated security risk scores (around 0.2) are justified due to the variable name implying testing activities, but no actual malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static reference list of AWS API methods, intended for testing or enumeration. No malicious or obfuscated activity is detected. The risk scores are appropriate, with a minor elevation due to the variable name suggesting potential misuse, but overall, the code is low risk.",
