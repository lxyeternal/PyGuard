{
  "purpose": "This data structure appears to be a dictionary categorizing AWS SDK method names, possibly for use in security or access control contexts.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the static dictionary 'BRUTEFORCE_TESTS', which contains predefined AWS API method names. No runtime input or external data sources are referenced.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted. The structure is static and does not include code that executes or transmits data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks. The dictionary is a static mapping with no executable logic or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a large static dictionary of AWS API method names, seemingly for brute-force testing or enumeration purposes. No obfuscated code, hidden code, or malicious behavior indicators are present. No credentials, secrets, or external network calls are included. No suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a large static dictionary mapping AWS service prefixes to lists of API method names. These are likely intended for brute-force or enumeration testing. There are no functions, dynamic operations, input/output processing, or external communications. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. The purpose appears to be related to security testing or enumeration, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the static nature and content of the code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a curated list of AWS API calls, possibly for testing purposes. No malware, suspicious code, or security risks are detected.",
