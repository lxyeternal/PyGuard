{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'enumerate_iam' Python package, primarily used for package installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the package version via __import__(PACKAGE).__version__, checking for the existence of 'README.md', and reading its contents.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing, user input, or network operations present.",
  "flows": "Reading version from package, reading README.md content, and passing data into the setup() function for packaging.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: importing modules, dynamically importing the package to get its version, checking for README.md and reading its content, and calling setuptools.setup() with package metadata and dependencies. All operations are typical for a Python package distribution script. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network connections, credential handling, or code injection. The code appears to be a legitimate setup script with no anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python package setup script with no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
