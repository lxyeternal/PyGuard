{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'enumerate_iam', handling version import and README inclusion.",
  "sources": "Reads package version via __import__(PACKAGE).__version__ and reads README.md if present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external network calls, or malicious code execution.",
  "flows": "Imports version info dynamically, reads README, then calls setup() with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import for version attribute; no suspicious or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The dynamic import of __version__ is standard but could, in theory, be exploited if the package source is compromised; however, this is a common pattern and not inherently dangerous. No external data, network activity, or code injection is present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a very low security risk score (0.1) reflecting the minor concern over dynamic import, which is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The slight security concern regarding dynamic import is acknowledged but does not constitute a real threat. Overall, the package is safe for use.",
