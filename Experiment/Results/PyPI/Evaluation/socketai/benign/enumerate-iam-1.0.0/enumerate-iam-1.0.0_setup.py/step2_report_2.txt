  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the script reads version info via `__import__(PACKAGE).__version__` and reads `README.md`.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or external calls.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious behavior.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The script is a standard setup script with no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** The report is accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes dynamic import of `__version__` and reading `README.md`.  \n- **Anomalies:** Mentions that importing `__version__` could be malicious if overridden, but this is standard practice.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; standard setup script.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1 (possibly reflecting minor concern about dynamic import), obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly cautious about the dynamic import, but this is common. The low security risk score (0.1) seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, notes standard behavior, no suspicious code, no untrusted data processing.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.1, obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar analysis; confirms standard setup process.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same conclusion: standard setup script, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, securityRisk = 0, obfuscated = 0.  \n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious activity or code execution involved.  \n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is straightforward and readable.  \n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation (0.1) in some reports due to the dynamic import of `__version__`. While this is standard, some security-conscious reviewers might flag it, but it doesn't pose a real risk here.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical setup script with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or obfuscation.  \n- The dynamic import of `__version__` is standard but could be slightly risky if the package's `__version__` attribute is maliciously overridden. However, this is an accepted practice in setup scripts and does not constitute a security threat in this context.\n\n### **My Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (very low; due to dynamic import, but standard practice)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is safe, with no security risks or malware. The slight concern about dynamic import is justified but does not warrant a higher risk score.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware score at 0.  \n- Obfuscated remains 0.  \n- Security risk score can be marginally increased to 0.1 for completeness, but it remains very low.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis is a standard, safe setup script with no security issues.",
