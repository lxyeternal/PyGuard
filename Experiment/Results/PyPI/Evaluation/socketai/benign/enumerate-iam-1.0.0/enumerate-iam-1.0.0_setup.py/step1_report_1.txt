  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Python project 'enumerate_iam' for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading the package version from __import__(PACKAGE).__version__, checking for 'README.md' file to read long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data used in sensitive operations or external calls.",
  "flows": "Reading version and description data from the filesystem and package module; no flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and setuptools, dynamically imports the version attribute from the package, and reads the README.md file if present. It then proceeds with the setup() function, providing metadata and dependencies. The code performs no network operations, no code injection, and contains no hidden or malicious logic. It is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script for packaging. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code reads package metadata and files securely and uses standard practices.",
