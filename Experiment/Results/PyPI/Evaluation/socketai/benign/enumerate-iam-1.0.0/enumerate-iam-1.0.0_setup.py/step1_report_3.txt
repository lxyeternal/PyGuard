  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'enumerate_iam' intended to configure and install the package dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the package version from the package module (__import__(PACKAGE).__version__), reading the 'README.md' file for the long description.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data being used in a vulnerable manner.",
  "flows": "Source: reading version from package; reading 'README.md' -> sinks: package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. The version import assumes the package's __version__ attribute exists.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'os' and 're' modules but only uses 'os' to check for the existence of 'README.md' and to open/read it. The version is imported dynamically from the package specified, which is standard in setup scripts. The setup() call includes typical metadata and dependencies. No code injection, network operations, or data leaks are present. The code does not execute untrusted input or perform malicious actions. It is a straightforward package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or security issues.",
