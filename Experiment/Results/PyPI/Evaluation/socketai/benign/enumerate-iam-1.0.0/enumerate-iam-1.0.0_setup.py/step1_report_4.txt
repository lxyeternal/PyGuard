{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'enumerate_iam', intended to configure package installation including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version via __import__(PACKAGE).__version__ and reads 'README.md' file if it exists.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data is being sent over the network or written insecurely.",
  "flows": "Reads package version to set the version; reads README.md content for long description.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. Uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script. It imports 'os' and 're', and uses 'setuptools' functions to configure the package. It dynamically imports the package to get its version, which is common practice. It reads 'README.md' content for the long description if available. No external inputs are processed beyond filesystem reads; no untrusted data is involved. No network connections, no execution of untrusted code, and no suspicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain security risks.",
