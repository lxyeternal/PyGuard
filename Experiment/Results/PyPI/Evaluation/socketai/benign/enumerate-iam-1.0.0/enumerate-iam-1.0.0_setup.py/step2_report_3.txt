  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the script is a standard setup script, with no suspicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks. It notes that no untrusted data is used, no external calls, and no anomalies are present.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The confidence is 1, which seems appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The report is accurate; the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, it recognizes the script as a typical setup script. It mentions the use of `__import__(PACKAGE).__version__`, which could, in theory, be exploited if the `__version__` attribute is maliciously overridden, but this is standard practice and not inherently dangerous.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. The slight security risk is justified due to the dynamic import, but it’s a common pattern.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior is detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, the report correctly states that the script is a straightforward setup script with no suspicious activity. It emphasizes that no untrusted data is processed and no network operations occur.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. This is consistent, considering the dynamic import.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The analysis is appropriate; no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** The report emphasizes the standard nature of the script, with no anomalies or malicious behavior. It correctly notes that the version is imported dynamically, which is typical.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0. This is accurate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** The code is benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, it correctly identifies the script as a standard setup script with no malicious activity or security risks.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0. Appropriate.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no malicious code, network activity, or suspicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is straightforward and readable.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to the dynamic import of `__version__`. While this is standard practice, some security policies might flag dynamic imports as a minor risk if the package source is untrusted. However, given the context, this is a common pattern in setup scripts and does not constitute a real security threat.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package.\n- No malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation is present.\n- The dynamic import of `__version__` is standard but can be considered a minor security concern if the package source is compromised. Nonetheless, in this context, it is acceptable and not indicative of malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Suggested Score | Justification                                                                                     |\n|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0                 | No malicious code, network activity, or exploits present.                                      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0                 | Code is clear, straightforward, and readable.                                                   |\n| Security Risk      | 0.0 – 0.1         | Minor due to dynamic import; acceptable in standard setup scripts.                            |\n\n**Final Recommendation:** The code is safe, with no security risks or malware. The slight security risk score (0.1) is justified but not indicative of actual malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Work through completed.**",
