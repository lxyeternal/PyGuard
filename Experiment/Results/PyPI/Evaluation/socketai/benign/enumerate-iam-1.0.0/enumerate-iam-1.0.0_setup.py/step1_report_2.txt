{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'enumerate-iam' that specifies dependencies and package metadata for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the package version from the module '__version__' attribute, checking existence of 'README.md', reading its content.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data processing or external data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Version is imported from the package; README content is read from disk; no external data flows or execution paths that could be malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Use of '__import__(PACKAGE).__version__' could potentially execute code if '__version__' is overridden maliciously, but this is standard practice in setup scripts. No other anomalies or suspicious code found.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It imports package version dynamically, reads the README file for long description, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata and dependencies. No input validation or untrusted data processing occurs. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a typical setup script for packaging a Python project. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on its content. It is safe to use.",
