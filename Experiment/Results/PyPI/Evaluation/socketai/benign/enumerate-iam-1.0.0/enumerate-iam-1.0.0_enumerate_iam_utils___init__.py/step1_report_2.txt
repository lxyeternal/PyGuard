  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or computation, potentially involving external input or configuration, but the specific intent is unclear due to limited context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables and possibly from user input or external files (if present), but no explicit sources are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions, network communication, or file operations if present, but these are not explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or external data into processing functions, and potentially to output or storage sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code execution, or obfuscated constructs are apparent. The code structure is straightforward without obvious anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and appears standard, with no suspicious or malicious constructs. It does not contain any malicious behaviors such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No unusual language features or obfuscation are present. Given the limited code, there is low confidence in detecting malicious intent or security issues, but the absence of suspicious elements suggests benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no anomalies detected. The overall security risk is low, and there is high confidence in this assessment.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
