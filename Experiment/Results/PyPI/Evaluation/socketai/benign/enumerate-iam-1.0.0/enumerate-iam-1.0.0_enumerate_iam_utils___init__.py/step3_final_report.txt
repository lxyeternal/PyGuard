  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external modules, network connections, system commands, file operations, dynamic eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, system commands, environment variables, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into sinks like network or system commands, potentially via dynamic execution or data handling functions.",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation, dynamic code execution pathways, hardcoded secrets, unusual variable usage, or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits no explicit malicious activity. Report 1 indicates moderate suspicion due to potential obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying a malware score of 0.2 and obfuscation score of 0.4. Other reports lack suspicious features, with scores reflecting benign assessments. The data supports low to moderate security risk levels. No concrete evidence of malware or obfuscation is present; scores are consistent with the observations. The absence of code in some reports justifies zero scores for malware and obfuscation, with high confidence in benignity where applicable.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the dependency appears benign with minimal suspicion. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. No significant modifications are necessary; continued monitoring and review of actual code snippets are recommended for definitive assessment.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
