  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform data processing and possibly interact with external systems or user inputs. Specific functionality is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input sources include reading data from environment variables, user inputs, or files. Exact sources are not explicitly detailed in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writing, or executing system commands. Specific sinks are not explicitly identified in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to sinks such as network or file operations, but exact flow paths cannot be fully determined without more code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious backdoors are observed in the provided snippet. The code appears straightforward, but the absence of detailed context limits certainty.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly, focusing on potential malicious patterns like dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, or hidden backdoors. No evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or malicious behavior was found. The code structure is typical of legitimate data processing scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard, benign Python script with no malicious intent detected.",
