{
  "purpose": "Remove 'ResponseMetadata' key from a dictionary response, likely from AWS boto3 responses.",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameter 'boto_response', which is expected to be a dictionary.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed further or exposed.",
  "flows": "Input 'boto_response' is checked for type, then modified by removing a specific key if present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code performs a straightforward data cleanup.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that takes a response object, checks if it is a dictionary, and if so, removes the 'ResponseMetadata' key. This is typical in AWS SDK usage to clean up responses for further processing. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The operation is safe and standard in AWS SDK workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears to be a benign utility function for cleaning AWS responses. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
