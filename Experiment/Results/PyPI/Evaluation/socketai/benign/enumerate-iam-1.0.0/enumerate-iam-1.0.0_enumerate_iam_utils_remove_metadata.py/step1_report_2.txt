{
  "purpose": "Remove 'ResponseMetadata' key from a boto3 response dictionary, likely for cleanup or data processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'boto_response' which is expected to be a dictionary, potentially from AWS SDK responses.",
  "sinks": "The function modifies the input dictionary directly; no data is sent elsewhere or leaks outside the function.",
  "flows": "Input 'boto_response' flows into the function, is conditionally modified by removing 'ResponseMetadata', then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward. It only removes a specific key if present.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if the input is a dictionary, then removes the 'ResponseMetadata' key to possibly streamline the response. This is a common pattern for cleaning AWS SDK responses. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The function does not perform network operations, handle credentials, or execute code that could be harmful. It appears to be a utility function for response processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple utility to clean AWS SDK response objects by removing metadata. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
