{
  "purpose": "Remove the 'ResponseMetadata' key from a dictionary response, typically from AWS SDK responses, to clean up the data.",
  "sources": "The input dictionary 'boto_response' is read; no external data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the function modifies the input dictionary in place.",
  "flows": "The function checks the type of 'boto_response' and conditionally removes a specific key, then returns the modified dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple type check and key removal operation on a dictionary, with no external dependencies or malicious intent. It is a common utility in AWS SDK response handling. No obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The minimal security risk score (0.1) assigned in some reports is slightly overestimated; the function's behavior is benign. The malware score is correctly 0, and the obfuscated score is 0. The overall security risk is effectively zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility function with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, though the slight elevation in security risk could be lowered to 0 for consistency. Overall, the function is safe and standard in AWS response processing.",
