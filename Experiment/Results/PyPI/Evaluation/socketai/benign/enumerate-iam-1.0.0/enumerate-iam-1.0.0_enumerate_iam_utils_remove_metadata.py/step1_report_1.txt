{
  "purpose": "The function 'remove_metadata' is designed to remove the 'ResponseMetadata' key from a dictionary, likely to clean up or filter AWS SDK responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'boto_response' parameter, which is expected to be a dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The code modifies the input dictionary directly; no external sinks or data leaks are directly present.",
  "flows": "Input 'boto_response' flows into the function, and if it's a dict, the 'ResponseMetadata' key is removed, then the dictionary is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are present. The function is simple and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code checks if the input is a dictionary and removes a specific key if present. This is typical in processing AWS SDK responses to clean up metadata. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious data handling. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The function's behavior is benign and focused on data cleanup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function that cleans up AWS SDK response dictionaries by removing response metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
