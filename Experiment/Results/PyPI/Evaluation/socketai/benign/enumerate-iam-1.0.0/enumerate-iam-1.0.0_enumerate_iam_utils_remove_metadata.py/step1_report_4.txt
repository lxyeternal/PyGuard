{
  "purpose": "Remove the 'ResponseMetadata' key from a boto3 response dictionary.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'boto_response' which is expected to be a dictionary, likely from a boto3 AWS SDK call.",
  "sinks": "The function modifies the input dictionary in place; no external sinks such as network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'boto_response' is checked for type, then potentially modified by removing a key, with no external data flows beyond the function scope.",
  "anomalies": "The function only removes a specific key from a dictionary; no suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and straightforward, checking if 'boto_response' is a dictionary before removing the 'ResponseMetadata' key. This key is commonly present in boto3 responses and contains metadata, not sensitive information. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The function appears to serve a benign purpose, likely to clean up response data. No external data reads or malicious sinks are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function intended to clean up AWS SDK response data. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It simply modifies the input dictionary to remove metadata.",
