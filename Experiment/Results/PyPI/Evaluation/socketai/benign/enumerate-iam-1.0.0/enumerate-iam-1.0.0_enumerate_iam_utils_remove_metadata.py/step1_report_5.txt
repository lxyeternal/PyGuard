{
  "purpose": "Remove 'ResponseMetadata' key from a boto3 response dictionary, likely to clean or process AWS SDK responses.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'boto_response', which is expected to be a dictionary, potentially from an AWS SDK call.",
  "sinks": "No data sink or output beyond the function's return; the code only modifies the input dictionary if it is a dict.",
  "flows": "Input 'boto_response' is checked and possibly modified within the function, then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code performs a simple dictionary key removal without any suspicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The function checks if the input is a dictionary, then removes the 'ResponseMetadata' key if it exists, and returns the possibly modified dictionary. No external inputs, no data leaks, no code injection, and no malicious behavior are evident. The operation is a standard cleanup step for AWS SDK responses, and there are no hidden or malicious activities involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility function to remove metadata from AWS responses. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
