  "purpose": "Utility functions for nested dict processing, date serialization, string encoding, and JSON writing.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters; uses standard library functions; reads no external or untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "Writes JSON string to file via 'file()' function.",
  "flows": "Data is processed through mapping functions, encoded, serialized with json.dumps, then written to file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated 'file()' instead of 'open()'; employs Python 2 style 'iteritems()' and 'unicode' type.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module with no signs of malicious behavior. It does not perform network activity, data exfiltration, or include backdoors. The use of outdated functions ('file()', 'iteritems()', 'unicode') indicates Python 2 code, which is deprecated but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The functions serve common data serialization purposes and are implemented securely, aside from deprecated syntax.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The primary concern is outdated syntax, which does not pose security risks. The malware score is correctly set to 0. The obfuscated score is 0, reflecting clear code. The security risk score is low (~0.1), justified by the outdated practices but no actual vulnerabilities. Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
