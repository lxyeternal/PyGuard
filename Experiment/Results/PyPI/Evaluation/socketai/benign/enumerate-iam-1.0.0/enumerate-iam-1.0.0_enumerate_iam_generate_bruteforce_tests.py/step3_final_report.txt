  "purpose": "Process AWS SDK JSON API definitions to extract operation names, filter them based on predefined criteria, and generate a Python script with the collected operations for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files from the 'aws-sdk-js/apis/' directory, specifically files ending with '.min.json'. Extracts 'endpointPrefix' from JSON metadata and operation details from 'operations' field.",
  "sinks": "Writes the final dictionary of service operations into 'bruteforce_tests.py' as a string formatted with 'BRUTEFORCE_TESTS = %s'. No untrusted data is executed or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Reads JSON files -> Parses JSON -> Extracts 'endpointPrefix' and operations -> Filters operations based on name and input content -> Accumulates operations per service -> Dumps data into a Python script file.",
  "anomalies": "Uses broad exception handling in 'extract_service_name' function without specific error handling. No obfuscation or malicious code detected. The filtering logic is straightforward string matching.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static file I/O and JSON parsing, with filtering based on operation name patterns and a blacklist. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. The logic is simple and transparent. The broad exception handling could be improved for robustness but does not introduce security risks. The code's purpose is benign, aimed at generating test data for AWS SDK operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script that processes static JSON API definitions to generate a Python test file. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a very low security risk score (around 0.1) are appropriate. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and straightforward nature.",
