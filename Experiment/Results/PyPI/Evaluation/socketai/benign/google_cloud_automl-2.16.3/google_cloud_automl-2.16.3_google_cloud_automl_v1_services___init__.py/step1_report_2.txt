  "anomalies": "Presence of licensing comments with no actual executable or malicious code; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of license comments and copyright notices, with no executable code, data processing, or input/output operations. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are evident. This appears to be a standard license header for a source code file, likely automatically included in a larger codebase. It does not perform any actions or contain any malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only licensing comments with no executable content or malicious behavior. It poses no security risk and is a standard header commonly used in open-source projects.",
