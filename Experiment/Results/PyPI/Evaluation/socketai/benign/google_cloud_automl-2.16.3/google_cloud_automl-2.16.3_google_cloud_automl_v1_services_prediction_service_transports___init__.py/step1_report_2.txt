{
  "purpose": "Define and register transport classes for a prediction service, including gRPC, async, and REST transports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from sources to sinks; the code only registers transport classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code appears standard for a client library setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports transport classes and registers them in an ordered dictionary for later use. There are no dynamic code evaluations, network calls, or data processing that could be exploited. It appears to be a straightforward module setup for a service SDK, with licensing headers and clear structure. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module for registering transport mechanisms in a client library, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard for such use.",
