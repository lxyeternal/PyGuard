{
  "purpose": "This code defines and registers various transport classes for a prediction service, facilitating different communication protocols (gRPC, asyncio, REST).",
  "sources": "The code reads static class imports and references within the local module and registry initialization.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks related to untrusted data processing or output. No network or file operations are present that could leak data.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing classes to populating a registry dictionary, with no dynamic or external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules, creates a registry dictionary, and assigns class references to specific keys. It uses standard Python syntax and structures without dynamic evaluation or external data handling. No suspicious logic or malicious behavior is detectable. The licensing comments and import statements are typical for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module for registering transport classes in a Python SDK. There are no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks. It appears safe and aligns with typical open-source package structure.",
