  "purpose": "Register transport mechanisms for the PredictionService SDK by importing classes and creating a registry.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest) and the creation of an ordered dictionary for transport registration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static registration with no data flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> registry dictionary -> exported symbols; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is static, straightforward, and standard for SDK setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic code, external data handling, network activity, or obfuscation. The structure is typical for SDK component registration. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or malicious constructs are present. The security and malware scores are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard SDK setup module with no malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score are appropriate and justified.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
