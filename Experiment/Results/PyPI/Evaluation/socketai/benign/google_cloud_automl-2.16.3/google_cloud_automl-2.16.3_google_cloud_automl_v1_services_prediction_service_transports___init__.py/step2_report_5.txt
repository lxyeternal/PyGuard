  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code in question is a straightforward module that imports specific classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and defines `__all__` for exports.\n- There are no signs of dynamic code execution, user input handling, network activity, or external data processing.\n- The code contains licensing headers and standard Python idioms, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious constructs are evident.\n- The purpose appears to be to organize and expose different transport mechanisms for a prediction service SDK.\n\n**Specific review of each report:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Register transport classes; imports from local modules.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious activity or security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1 — reasonable.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar registration of transport classes.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; standard SDK setup, no risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — the small securityRisk is acceptable given the static nature; no external threats.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Accurate; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Registration of transport classes.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; standard setup code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- **Presence of malware:** All reports correctly identify no malware. The code is purely static setup.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected; code is clear and standard.\n- **Risk scores:** All are either 0 or very low (0.1). Given the static, non-executable nature of the code, these are reasonable.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- The code is a typical, safe module for registering transport classes.\n- No evidence suggests malicious intent or security risks.\n- The risk scores are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n\n### My overall estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk in static setup code)\n\n**Summary:** The code is benign, standard SDK setup, with no security concerns.",
