  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward module that imports classes, registers them in an ordered dictionary, and exports symbols.\n- No data flows, external communications, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are identified.\n- The code is standard for setting up transport mechanisms in a client SDK.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code is static, with no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which is appropriate given the absence of any vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n- The malware scores are all 0, consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The reports are very consistent and thorough; no contradictions or unreasonable scores are apparent.\n- The only minor point is the \"securityRisk\" score of 0.1 in report 2, which might be slightly high given the absence of any real security concerns. However, since it’s a minimal score, it’s acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk mostly 0) are appropriate and justified.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, well-structured module for registering transport classes, with no security issues or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No further action needed. The supply chain security risk here is negligible.",
