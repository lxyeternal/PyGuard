{
  "purpose": "This code defines a registry for different transport mechanisms of a prediction service, likely used in a larger machine learning or API client library.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and classes, especially from the current package (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest), and creates a registry dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code maps transport string keys to transport classes in a registry, with no data flow involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes related to prediction service transports and registers them in an ordered dictionary for easy access. It appears to be a straightforward setup for a client SDK component. No obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The licensing comments and structure are standard for open-source Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard component of an SDK, establishing a registry for different transport mechanisms without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears safe and intentionally structured for modular transport selection.",
