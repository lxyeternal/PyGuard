{
  "purpose": "Define and register different transport mechanisms for a prediction service API.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio, .rest), static dictionary assignment",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data processing observed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; code mainly imports, initializes a registry, and exports symbols",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes from local modules, creates an ordered registry dictionary for transport classes, and defines __all__ for export. It appears to be a standard setup for configuring and exporting transport classes for a prediction service API. No data input, external communication, or sensitive data handling occurs. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup module for registering transport mechanisms; it does not contain malware or security risks. It simply organizes and exposes components for use in a larger application.",
