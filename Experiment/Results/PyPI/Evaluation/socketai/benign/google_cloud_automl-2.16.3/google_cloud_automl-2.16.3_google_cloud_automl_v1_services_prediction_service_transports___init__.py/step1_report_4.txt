{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a registry for different transport classes used by a Prediction Service API, facilitating modular communication methods (gRPC, asyncio, REST).",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and classes related to transport mechanisms, and constructs a registry dictionary mapping strings to classes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data, user input, or external data sources. The code only defines static mappings and imports.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely establishes class references and exports them for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated segments are present. The code appears straightforward, well-structured, and adheres to typical Python practices.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary classes, constructs an ordered dictionary mapping string keys to transport classes, and defines an __all__ tuple for module exports. It contains licensing information and standard Python import statements. No dynamic code execution, external input handling, or sensitive data handling is present. The logic is static and intended for module setup. The overall structure is consistent with standard Python package design for modular API transports.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code performs standard setup for transport class registration with no suspicious or malicious elements.",
