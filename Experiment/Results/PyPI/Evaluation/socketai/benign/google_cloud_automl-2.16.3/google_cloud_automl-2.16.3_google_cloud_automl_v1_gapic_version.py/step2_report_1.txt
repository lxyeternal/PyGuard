  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is solely composed of licensing comments, copyright notices, and a version assignment (`__version__ = \"2.16.3\"`).\n   - There are no executable logic, data input/output, network calls, or dynamic code elements.\n   - No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Elements**:\n   - The code is static and purely informational.\n   - No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or backdoors.\n   - The malware score in all reports is 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n3. **Security Risks & Anomalies**:\n   - No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - The code is typical for open-source project headers, with no security concerns.\n\n4. **Scores & Reasoning**:\n   - All reports assign a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, matching the clear, unaltered comments and assignments.\n   - The security risk score is 0, consistent with the absence of any malicious or risky content.\n\n**Critical Evaluation & Recommendations**:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no adjustments needed.\n- The reasoning is sound, and the conclusions are justified.\n- Since the code is purely metadata, the risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code fragment is benign and contains no security concerns.",
