{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a header comment block and metadata declaration for a Python package or module, mainly providing licensing, copyright, and version information.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the static comment block and the version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present, as there is no executable code or data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks exists; the code is purely informational.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and a single version string assignment. It contains licensing information, copyright, and version metadata. There are no functions, variables, input handling, or code execution that could pose security risks. The structure and format are typical for package headers, and no obfuscated or suspicious elements are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a metadata header for a Python package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks.",
