  "purpose": "This code serves as a header comment block containing licensing information, copyright notices, and a version assignment for a Python module.",
  "sources": "The version assignment (__version__ = \"2.16.3\") and the comment block containing licensing and copyright information.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; the code does not interact with external systems or data sources.",
  "flows": "No data flows or dynamic execution paths are present; the code is static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; the code consists solely of comments and a straightforward variable assignment with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static header with licensing comments and a version string assignment. It contains no executable logic, data handling, network communication, or dynamic code. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in these assessments is high (close to 1). There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns. The code is typical for open-source modules and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static header containing licensing and version information with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to zero. No further action or concern is warranted.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
