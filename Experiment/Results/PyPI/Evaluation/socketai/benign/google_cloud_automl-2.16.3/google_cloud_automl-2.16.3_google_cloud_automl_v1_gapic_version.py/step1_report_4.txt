  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard license header and version declaration for a Python project, with no executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "License comments, version assignment (__version__ = '2.16.3')",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions present",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing present",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; only comments and a version variable",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a version string assignment. There are no functions, input handling, data processing, or other executable code that could lead to malicious behavior. This is a standard header section typically found in Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign header containing licensing information and versioning, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
