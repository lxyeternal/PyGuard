{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer that imports and exposes the PredictionServiceClient and PredictionServiceAsyncClient classes for external use, facilitating easier access to prediction service functionalities within a larger SDK or application.",
  "sources": "The code reads input/data from local module imports (.async_client and .client) when these modules are loaded; no external input is processed at runtime.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code only imports classes and defines an export list without executing any logic or handling external data.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing classes from local modules and exposing them via __all__, with no data processing, network calls, or untrusted data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard Python module that imports classes from local modules and exposes them via __all__. It contains only licensing comments, import statements, and an export list, with no embedded logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify this as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the clarity and lack of suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for exporting client classes, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores are justified and should remain at zero across all categories.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
