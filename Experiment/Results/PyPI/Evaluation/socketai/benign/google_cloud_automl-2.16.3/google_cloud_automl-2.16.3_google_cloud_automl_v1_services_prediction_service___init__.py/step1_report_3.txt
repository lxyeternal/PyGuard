  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module defining exports for prediction service clients, likely part of a larger SDK or API client library.",
  "sources": "The import statements read from local package files, not from external or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "The code exports class names via __all__, which could be used elsewhere, but no sinks are directly present here.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this snippet; it only imports and exports class names.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and standard for Python modules.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes and defines __all__ for module exports. It includes license information and standard module structure. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected. It is a simple, clean module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python module for exporting client classes, with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It functions as part of a library interface.",
