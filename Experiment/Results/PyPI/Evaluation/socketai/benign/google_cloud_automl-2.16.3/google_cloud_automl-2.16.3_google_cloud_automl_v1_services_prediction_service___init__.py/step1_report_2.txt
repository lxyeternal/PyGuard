{
  "purpose": "The code exports two classes for prediction services, likely used for machine learning model inference.",
  "sources": "Imports PredictionServiceAsyncClient and PredictionServiceClient from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform dangerous actions are present.",
  "flows": "The code only imports classes and defines an __all__ list; no data flow or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that re-exports classes related to prediction services. It contains only import statements and an __all__ declaration. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing steps. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The structure is typical for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module for exporting client classes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
