  "purpose": "Exporting and defining publicly accessible classes for Prediction Service clients (sync and async).",
  "sources": "Imports of modules '.async_client' and '.client' to access classes PredictionServiceAsyncClient and PredictionServiceClient.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only imports and exposes classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is straightforward and standard for module exports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two classes from internal modules and declares them in the __all__ list for public API exposure. It contains licensing information and no runtime or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module initialization snippet for a Python package, exposing client classes for use elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
