{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports and exposes classes related to prediction services, likely for a client SDK or API wrapper.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes from local modules (.async_client and .client). No external data sources or user input are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or vulnerable points; no untrusted data handling or sensitive data exposure observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code mainly imports and exposes classes without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, involving only import statements and module exports (__all__). It is a typical Python module pattern with no embedded logic, no input handling, no network operations, or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent. The license comments indicate open-source and legitimate usage. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign Python module that exposes classes for a client API. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate part of a client library.",
