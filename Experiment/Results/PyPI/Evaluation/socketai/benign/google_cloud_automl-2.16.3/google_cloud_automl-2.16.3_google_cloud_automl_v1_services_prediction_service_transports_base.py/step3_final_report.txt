  "purpose": "Abstract transport class for Google Cloud PredictionService, managing credentials, host configuration, and method wrapping.",
  "sources": "Credential loading methods, host string, method definitions for predict and batch_predict.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; credentials and host used for API requests, no data leaks or malicious network calls.",
  "flows": "Credentials and host information flow into API request setup; method wrapping for predict and batch_predict.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured SDK abstract class handling credentials, host configuration, and method wrapping securely. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows are present. Credential management follows best practices, and the code is clear and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a Google Cloud API transport layer. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and low security risk score are justified based on the code's clarity and adherence to best practices.",
