  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, logic, and security implications.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code is a standard abstract transport class for Google Cloud's PredictionService, handling credentials, host configuration, and method wrapping.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious code patterns. Credential handling aligns with standard practices.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Both are set to 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion that the code is legitimate and safe is justified. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing credential management and method wrapping.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, no network calls, no data leaks, no obfuscation. Slight mention of a security risk score of 0.1, but it's minor.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which aligns with the findings.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is sound. The minor security risk score reflects cautious acknowledgment but no actual issues. No adjustments necessary.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on secure credential handling, host configuration, and method wrapping.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no malicious patterns.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Both are 0, which is consistent.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as standard and secure. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, emphasizing configuration and credential management.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious activity, no suspicious network calls, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Both are 0.1 and 0, respectively, which is reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is appropriate. No modifications necessary.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Describes the code as a standard transport class with credential management.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious behavior, no backdoors, no obfuscation, standard credential handling.\n- **Risk and Malware Scores:** Both are 0, matching the assessment.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion is justified; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, which is correct; the code is standard SDK infrastructure with no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0 or very close to it, reflecting minimal to no security risk.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear, standard, and un-obfuscated.\n- **Risk:** **0** — no security risks identified; the code is a typical SDK transport class.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of a Google Cloud API transport layer. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified.",
