{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an initialization module for the Google Cloud AutoML Python SDK, importing version info, client classes, data types, and setting up the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from various google.cloud.automl_v1 modules, including version info, client classes, data types, and operation/request/response types.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; the code only performs static imports and exports.",
  "flows": "The code flows from static imports to the __all__ declaration, exposing classes and constants for SDK users; no runtime data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution; typical SDK setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py or module setup file for a Python SDK, importing necessary classes and types from the google.cloud.automl_v1 package and exposing them via __all__. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, safe SDK setup module with no malicious behavior or security concerns. All signals indicate a benign, well-structured library initialization script.",
