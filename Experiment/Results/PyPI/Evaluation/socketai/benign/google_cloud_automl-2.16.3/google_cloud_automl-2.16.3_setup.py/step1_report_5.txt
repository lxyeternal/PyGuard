  "purpose": "This script configures the setup process for a Python package, including reading version information, dependencies, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the version from 'google/cloud/automl/gapic_version.py' file, reading the README file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or external outputs, no network connections, no sensitive data handling or logging.",
  "flows": "The only data flow involves reading files for metadata and then passing this data to setuptools.setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected. The code uses standard package setup procedures without obfuscation or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script. It reads version info from a source file, reads README content for long description, and uses setuptools for packaging. No user input or untrusted data is processed in a way that could lead to security issues. There are no external network calls, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious code patterns or obfuscation. All operations are related to package metadata and dependencies management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate and typical setup script for a Python package without any malicious intent or security risks. It simply reads package metadata and configures the build process.",
