  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**  \nThe provided script is a standard Python package setup script. It reads version info from a local file (`gapic_version.py`) using regex, reads a README file for the long description, defines dependencies and extras, and invokes `setuptools.setup()` with package metadata. It performs no network operations, no dynamic code execution, no user input handling, and no obfuscated or suspicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** No. The code is typical for a package setup.\n- **Use of untrusted data:** Only reading local files, no external untrusted sources.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None detected.\n- **Malware indicators:** None observed.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation present.\n- **Security risks:** None apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Specific issues in reports:\n- All five reports agree that the script is a standard setup configuration with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security vulnerabilities.\n- They correctly identify that the regex is straightforward, and the operations are static and safe.\n- No report claims any actual vulnerability or malicious activity.\n\n### Scores:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correct.\n- **Risk score:** All assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there's no malicious activity, no untrusted data handling, and the code is purely static configuration, a risk score of 0 is justified.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The code is benign and typical for a Python package setup.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis supply chain dependency is safe. It is a standard setup script with no malicious or security concerns.",
