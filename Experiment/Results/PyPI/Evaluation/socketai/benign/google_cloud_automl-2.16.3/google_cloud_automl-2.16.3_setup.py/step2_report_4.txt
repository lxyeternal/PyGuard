  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package (`google-cloud-automl`).\n- They confirm that the script reads version info from a local file, reads README content, and sets up dependencies and package metadata.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, network activity, or handling of untrusted data is detected.\n- The regex used for version extraction is straightforward and not malicious.\n- The dependencies are well-defined and constrained.\n- The script does not perform any dynamic code execution, network calls, or handle sensitive data.\n\n**Potential issues or anomalies:**\n- The only minor point is the regex pattern used to extract the version: `r\"(?<=\\\")\\d+.\\d+.\\d+(?=\\\")\"`. While this is standard, it assumes the version string is always in quotes and formatted as `X.Y.Z`. If the version file format changes, this could cause an assertion failure, but this is a benign issue and not security-related.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0, which is appropriate.\n- The confidence scores are 1, indicating high certainty.\n- The reasoning in all reports is consistent and sound.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The script is a typical package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks.\n- The scores are reasonable and justified.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis is a straightforward, benign setup script.\n\n**Final note:** The reports are thorough and accurate; I concur with their conclusions and scores.",
