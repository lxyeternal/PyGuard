{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging the 'google-cloud-automl' Python library, configuring metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from 'gapic_version.py' via regex, reads README file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static file reads only, no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Source (version file, README) to setup configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; regex assumes version string format but is straightforward; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs static configuration tasks: reading local files, extracting version info with regex, and invoking setuptools.setup(). No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input. The regex is simple and safe, and dependencies are well-defined with constraints. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and poses no security threats or malicious intent. All signals indicate a safe package configuration script with no obfuscation or malware. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
