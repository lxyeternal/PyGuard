{
  "purpose": "The source code provides functions to analyze Python source files, computing metrics such as total lines, logical lines, comments, multi-line strings, and blank lines, primarily for code quality or complexity assessment.",
  "sources": "The code reads input source code as a string, which is tokenized via the tokenize module; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects; the code operates solely on internal tokenized data.",
  "flows": "The flow involves tokenizing the input source code, filtering tokens, and counting specific token types to generate metrics; no external or malicious data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code tokenizes Python source code to count lines, comments, strings, and logical lines, using standard modules without executing or modifying external systems. It handles multi-line strings and comments carefully, and provides a structured summary of code metrics. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident; the functions are purely analytical and static in nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility for Python source code metrics, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It relies solely on standard libraries and performs safe token processing. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware likelihood is zero.",
