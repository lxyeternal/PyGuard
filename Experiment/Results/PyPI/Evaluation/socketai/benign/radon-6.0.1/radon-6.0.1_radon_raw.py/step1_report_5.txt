{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions for tokenizing, analyzing, and counting different types of lines in Python source code, primarily for metrics related to lines of code and comments.",
  "sources": "Code reads input source code via the 'source' parameter in 'analyze' function; uses tokenize.generate_tokens for tokenization; reads lines from input string and internal iterators.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to files, send data over the network, execute untrusted input, or manipulate environment variables; no sinks indicating malicious data leakage.",
  "flows": "Source is the input source code string; tokens are generated by 'tokenize.generate_tokens'; analysis functions process tokens to count lines and comments; no data flows to external systems or insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The use of 'tokenize' is standard. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code thoroughly tokenizes Python source code, identifies comments, strings, and code lines, and counts logical vs physical lines. It handles multi-line strings and comments conservatively, with no apparent malicious behavior. No external network calls, system modifications, or suspicious code constructs are found. It strictly focuses on static code analysis for metrics. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility module for code metrics.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign static analysis tool for Python code metrics. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It is safe and intended solely for code analysis purposes.",
