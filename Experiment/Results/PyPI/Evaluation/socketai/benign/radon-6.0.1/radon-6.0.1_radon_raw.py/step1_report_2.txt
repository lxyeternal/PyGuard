{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to analyze Python source code metrics, such as lines of code, comments, and logical lines, primarily for code complexity analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads source code input from a string parameter in the analyze() function, processes it through tokenization, and parses tokens to compute various metrics.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or security effects. It mainly performs static analysis without external communication or data modification.",
  "flows": "The analyze() function reads source code, tokenizes it, processes tokens to count different line types, and returns structured metrics. There are no data flows that could lead to code injection or exploitation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The code uses standard library modules (tokenize, collections, operator) and performs static analysis only.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis of Python source code to count lines, comments, docstrings, and logical lines. It uses tokenization to parse source code and identify comment lines, string literals, and logical code structures. No dynamic execution, external network activity, or data leaks are detected. The functions are straightforward, well-structured, and do not include obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis tool designed for code metrics computation. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The overall security risk score is low. Confidence in this conclusion is high, as the code relies solely on standard modules and performs safe analysis tasks.",
