{
  "purpose": "A minimal wrapper script that imports and executes radon.main() to invoke Radon's CLI functionality.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'main' from the 'radon' package.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'main()' which executes Radon's main function; no untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'main' -> call to 'main()' execution.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward CLI wrapper, importing and executing 'radon.main()'. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate. The slight variation in 'securityRisk' (0.1) in one report is unwarranted given the code's simplicity and benign nature. The code delegates to a trusted, open-source tool without processing untrusted input directly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, a standard CLI wrapper for Radon, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The malware and obfuscated scores are correct at 0. The security risk score should be 0, not 0.1, as the code itself poses minimal risk.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
