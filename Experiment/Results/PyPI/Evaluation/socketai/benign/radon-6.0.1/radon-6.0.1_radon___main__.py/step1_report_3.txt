  "purpose": "This module allows for executing the 'radon' tool via command line using 'python -m radon'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' from the 'radon' package.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'main()' function from the imported 'radon' package, which executes the tool's main logic.",
  "flows": "Import of 'main' -> execution of 'main()' function, which runs the radon analysis process.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward invocation of an external package's main function.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'main' function from the 'radon' package and executes it immediately. There are no suspicious code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors. 'radon' is a legitimate Python code quality tool, and executing its main function aligns with intended usage. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wrapper to invoke 'radon' for code analysis. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It performs a legitimate, expected operation.",
