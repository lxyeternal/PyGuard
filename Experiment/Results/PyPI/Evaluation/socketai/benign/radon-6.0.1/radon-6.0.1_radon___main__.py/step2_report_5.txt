  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal wrapper that imports `main` from `radon` and calls it.\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious intent.\n- Radon is an open-source code analysis tool, and invoking its `main()` function directly is standard practice for CLI wrappers.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The code matches the description in all reports. The code is just:\n  ```python\n  from radon import main\n  main()\n  ```\n  No anomalies, no suspicious constructs.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No. The code is simple and correct for its purpose.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**\n\n  - **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n  - **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n  - **Security Risk:** Mostly 0, except report 5 assigns 0.1. Since the code is just a wrapper, a small non-zero score seems unwarranted unless there's an explicit concern.\n\n---\n\n### Specific review of each report:\n\n#### Reports 1-4:\n- All assign:\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - SecurityRisk: 0\n  - Confidence: 1\n\n**These are reasonable.**\n\n#### Report 5:\n- Assigns:\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Malware: 0\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1\n  - Confidence: 1\n\n**Is a 0.1 security risk justified?**  \nGiven the code's simplicity, there is no evident security risk. The only potential concern might be if `main()` internally executes untrusted code or accepts untrusted input, but that is outside the scope of this snippet. The code itself does not introduce any risk.\n\n**Therefore, a security risk score of 0.1 seems slightly inflated.**  \nIt would be more accurate to assign 0, unless there is external context suggesting that `radon.main()` could be malicious or insecure.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All are 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All are 0, which is correct.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Since the code is a straightforward wrapper with no malicious or risky behavior, the risk score should be **0** across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust the risk score in report 5 from 0.1 to 0.0.**  \n- **Maintain malware and obfuscated scores at 0.**  \n- **Overall, the code is safe, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | SecurityRisk | Comments |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|----------|\n| 1-4     | 0       | 0            | 0            | Correctly assigned; no issues |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0            | Should be 0; no inherent risk |\n\n---\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, safe CLI wrapper for the `radon` tool.",
