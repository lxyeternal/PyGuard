{
  "purpose": "This module is designed to invoke the 'main' function from the 'radon' package, likely to facilitate command-line usage such as 'python -m radon ...'.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'main' function from the 'radon' package.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'main()' without any user-provided or external data inputs, so there are no direct sinks related to untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The flow involves executing 'main()' from the 'radon' package, which is a standard entry point; no data flow from untrusted sources is evident within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, simply calling 'main()' after import, with no unusual language features or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the primary function 'main' from the 'radon' package and executes it directly. This is a typical pattern for command-line interface modules that delegate execution to a library's main function. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects. The module's purpose is likely to serve as a command-line entry point for the 'radon' tool, with no indications of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward invocation of a library's main function intended for command-line use. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The implementation appears safe and typical for such utility modules.",
