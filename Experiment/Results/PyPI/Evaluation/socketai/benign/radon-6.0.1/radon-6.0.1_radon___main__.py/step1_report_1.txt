{
  "purpose": "This module allows for executing the 'radon' command-line interface via Python's -m option.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'main' function from the 'radon' package and calls it, which is a standard way to invoke the package's CLI.",
  "sinks": "The call to 'main()' executes the entry point of the 'radon' package, which may process user input or command-line arguments.",
  "flows": "The script directly calls 'main()', passing control to the 'radon' package's main entry point; data flows from command-line input through 'main()' execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports and executes the primary function of the 'radon' package. Radon is a well-known tool for code analysis, and invoking 'main()' is standard usage. There are no signs of obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious intent. It merely acts as a wrapper to run Radon's CLI functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, legitimate wrapper to invoke the 'radon' tool via Python. No malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies are present. It appears safe and standard.",
