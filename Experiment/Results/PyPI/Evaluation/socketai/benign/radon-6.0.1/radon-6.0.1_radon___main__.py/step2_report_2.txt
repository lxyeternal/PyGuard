  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- All reports describe a minimal script that imports `main` from the `radon` package and executes it.\n- The code pattern is standard for CLI wrappers.\n- No suspicious code constructs, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- Radon is an open-source code analysis tool, and invoking its `main()` function directly is typical usage.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- Security risk scores are uniformly low (mostly 0, with one at 0.1), which is consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The reports correctly identify that the code simply imports and executes `radon.main()`. There are no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report?**  \n  No significant errors. The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports give malware scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis. The security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5):**  \n  None of the reports justify a risk score above 0.5. Given the code's simplicity and the open-source nature of `radon`, a higher score would be unjustified.\n\n- **Malware score reflection:**  \n  Correctly set to 0 across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All analyses are based on the code content and context, not assumptions.\n\n- **Score consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the reports' findings.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The only report with a slightly higher security risk score (0.1) does not specify a reason. Given the benign code, even this slight increase seems unwarranted. It should be lowered to 0.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n| Metric             | Score  | Justification                                              |\n|--------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0       | No malicious activity or indicators present.               |\n| Obfuscated         | 0       | Code is clear, minimal, and straightforward.                |\n| Security Risk      | 0       | No vulnerabilities or risky behaviors identified.          |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a legitimate, straightforward CLI wrapper for the `radon` tool, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scores should reflect the benign nature of this snippet.",
