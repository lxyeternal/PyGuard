{
  "purpose": "This module is designed to run the 'main' function from the 'radon' package, likely to perform code analysis or metrics collection via command line interface.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'main' from the 'radon' package and executes it directly.",
  "sinks": "Execution flow leads to the 'main' function within 'radon', which may process command-line arguments and perform analysis.",
  "flows": "Import of 'main' -> execution of 'main()' -> processing within 'radon' package's main function.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious logic are present. The code simply delegates to an existing package.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single function and executes it, which is typical for command-line utility scripts. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious data handling. Since 'radon' is an open-source code quality tool, this pattern is standard for CLI wrapper scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward wrapper to invoke 'radon' functionality, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
