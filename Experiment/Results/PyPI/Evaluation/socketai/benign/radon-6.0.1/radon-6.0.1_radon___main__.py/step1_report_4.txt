{
  "purpose": "The code acts as a module to run the 'radon' tool via command line, executing its main function.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'main' from the 'radon' library.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'main()' function from 'radon', which could process input if radon is designed to accept external input.",
  "flows": "Import from 'radon' -> call to 'main()' which may process command line arguments or input data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets. The code is straightforward and relies entirely on the imported library's functionality.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'main' from the 'radon' package and executes it. Radon is a known open-source code analysis tool. Since 'main()' is called directly, its behavior depends on how 'radon.main()' processes input. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs are present. The code is minimal and appears to serve as a command-line interface entry point for the 'radon' tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wrapper to invoke the 'radon' tool's main function. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. It appears to be a standard way to run 'radon' as a module.",
