  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'radon' Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file for long description; importing 'radon' module for version info; defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes or executes untrusted input; no sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or code execution based on user input.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only performs package setup configurations, no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code structures detected. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures for a Python package, including reading a README file, defining package info, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers. It imports 'radon' solely for fetching version info. There is no code execution based on untrusted input or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious behavior or security concerns. It simply configures package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
