  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup.py script.\n- No report detects any suspicious or malicious activity.\n- The code reads a README file, imports 'radon' for version info, and calls setup() with static parameters.\n- No untrusted data handling, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present.\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risks are minimal, with only a slight mention (0.1) in report 2, likely due to the presence of version info import, which is benign.\n\n**Detailed review:**\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Assessment:** No issues, benign setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Assessment:** Also correct, no anomalies.\n- **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 — perhaps slightly overestimating; the import of 'radon' for version info is standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1 — acceptable, though slightly conservative.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Assessment:** Same as above, standard setup.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — correct.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Assessment:** Standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0 — fitting.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final scoring considerations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports agree on 0, which is justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation (0.1 in report 2) is acceptable; overall, the script is benign.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0 — standard setup script, no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No modifications needed; all scores and conclusions are justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.\n- The code is a typical, safe setup.py script with no security issues.",
