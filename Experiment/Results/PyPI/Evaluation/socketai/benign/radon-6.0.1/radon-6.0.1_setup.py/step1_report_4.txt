{
  "purpose": "The script is used to configure and set up the 'radon' Python package for distribution, including metadata, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long description; importing 'radon' module for version info; no other data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted or external data; the code primarily sets package metadata and dependencies without executing untrusted code or network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A - the script does not process untrusted data or flow data from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The use of 'radon.__version__' is standard for versioning.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules ('os', 'setuptools', 'radon') and reads a README file to include in package metadata. It calls 'setup()' with package info, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers. All actions are typical for package setup. There are no signs of malicious or suspicious behavior, code injection, or data exfiltration. No external or untrusted inputs are processed in a manner that would pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging the 'radon' Python module. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and appears safe. The presence of dependency specifications and entry points does not indicate malicious intent.",
