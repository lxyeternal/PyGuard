{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'radon' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.rst file for the long description; imports package metadata from 'radon' module; gathers package files with find_packages(); specifies dependencies and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; setup configuration parameters are static, and no network or system commands are executed based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks involving untrusted data; all inputs are static files or predefined variables.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present; the code strictly adheres to standard setup.py practices.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reading a README file, importing package version info, and calling setup() with static parameters. No dynamic code execution, user input handling, or network activity is observed. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are evident. Dependencies are clearly specified, and entry points are standard for CLI tools. The code's structure and content align with typical setup scripts, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign setup configuration script for the 'radon' package. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are detected. It is safe to use.",
