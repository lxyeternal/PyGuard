  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for the 'radon' package.\n- The code reads a README file, imports the 'radon' module to get its version, and calls `setup()` with static metadata, dependencies, and entry points.\n- No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious constructs are identified.\n- The 'radon' module is imported solely for fetching version info, which is common practice.\n- The code appears to follow best practices for a setup.py script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of malicious code or vulnerabilities:** None. All reports, including the detailed reasoning, conclude the script is benign.\n- **Malware or suspicious activity:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risks:** None evident; the script is a typical setup configuration.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in Logic:\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent. The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n\n### Score Justifications:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, correctly reflecting the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0 or very close to 0, which is reasonable.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a straightforward, standard setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. It is safe and does not pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll evidence points to a benign setup script. The package configuration is typical, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are justified and should remain as is.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0",
