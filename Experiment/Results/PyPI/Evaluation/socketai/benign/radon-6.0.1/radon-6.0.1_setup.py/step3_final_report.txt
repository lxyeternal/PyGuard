  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for the 'radon' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading README file, importing 'radon' module for version info, static configuration data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Importing 'radon' for version info; static data used in setup() call.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code follows typical setup script patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup.py script that reads a README file, imports 'radon' solely to access its version, and calls setup() with static metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No untrusted input, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation is present. All signals indicate benign, standard package configuration. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate; minor adjustment of the security risk score to 0 across all reports would improve consistency. Overall, the package configuration is safe and free from vulnerabilities.",
