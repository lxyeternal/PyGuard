{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'radon' Python package, used for code metrics and static analysis.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.rst' file for long description; importing version from 'radon'; reading environment variables for Python version-dependent dependencies.",
  "sinks": "None identified; setup configuration and package metadata do not directly process untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. External URLs and dependencies are static, not dynamically generated.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic observed. Usage of environment variables for version dependencies is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations: reading a README file, configuring package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling present. The imported 'radon' module's version is used for package info but is not malicious. External URLs and dependency versions are static and appear legitimate. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It simply configures package installation parameters and metadata.",
