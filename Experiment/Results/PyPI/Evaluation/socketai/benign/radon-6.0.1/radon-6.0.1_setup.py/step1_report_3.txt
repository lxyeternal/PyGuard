{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for the 'radon' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "Reading the README file, importing modules (os, setuptools, radon), accessing radon.__version__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup configuration parameters are static and predefined",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; configuration is static and internal",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with conventional package configuration",
  "analysis": "The script reads a README file, imports the radon module for version info, and defines package setup parameters including dependencies, entry points, and classifiers. All operations are typical for Python package setup files. There are no signs of malicious code such as dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Dependencies are specified with version constraints, and no user input or untrusted data is processed or executed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign Python package setup script with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
