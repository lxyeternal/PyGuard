  "purpose": "Define constants and functions for terminal text coloring based on environment variables and import status.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('COLOR'), sys.stdout.isatty(), import colorama",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data leading to security impacts.",
  "flows": "Environment variable read influences colorama initialization; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation present. Use of environment variables for color configuration is typical, no malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and optionally colorama for colored terminal output. It checks an environment variable to determine whether to enable colors, then initializes colorama if available, falling back gracefully if not. The color constants are set statically or empty strings if colorama is missing. No user input processing or untrusted data handling occurs. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or malicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility module for managing terminal color settings. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. Its purpose is configuration and initialization for color output, with fallback handling if dependencies are missing.",
