  "purpose": "Provides constants and functions for terminal output formatting, including color management using colorama.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variable 'COLOR' via os.getenv('COLOR', 'auto') and checks sys.stdout.isatty().",
  "sinks": "Uses colorama to initialize terminal colors; no untrusted data used in sinks that affect system behavior.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COLOR' influences color_enabled() which determines color output; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code. Fallback to no-color mode if colorama is not available is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages terminal text color formatting, with environment-based configuration and optional third-party library use. It does not include data input/output or network communication. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The code handles imports, environment variables, and conditional initialization cleanly. It avoids dynamic code execution or obfuscated logic. The fallback mechanism is safe and standard.\n\nOverall, this code serves a UI/UX purpose without security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign utility for terminal output formatting. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious activity detected.",
