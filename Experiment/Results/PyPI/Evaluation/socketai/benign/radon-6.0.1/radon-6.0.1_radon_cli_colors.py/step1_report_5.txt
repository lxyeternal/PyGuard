{
  "purpose": "This module defines constants and functions for terminal output styling, including color configuration based on environment variables and package imports.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COLOR' for color enabling; import of 'os', 'sys', and optional 'colorama' package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; only configuration variables and environment settings are used.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COLOR' influences 'color_enabled()' decision; 'colorama' import and initialization depend on this; color constants are set accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior; environment-based color configuration is standard; no hardcoded credentials or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages terminal color output. It reads environment variables ('COLOR') to determine if color should be enabled, and attempts to import 'colorama' to handle cross-platform color support. If 'colorama' is unavailable, it defaults to no color. The code assigns color constants based on 'colorama' and defines color mappings for ranks and letters. The use of environment variables and optional imports are typical for such configuration modules. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration utility for terminal output formatting with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
