{
  "purpose": "Define constants and functions for terminal color formatting based on environment variables and available libraries.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('COLOR'), sys.stdout.isatty(), import of colorama",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data are present; the code primarily sets variables based on environment and library import status",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'COLOR' influences color_enable() output; colorama import and initialization depend on environment and availability",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic; fallback to no color mode if colorama is unavailable",
  "analysis": "The code checks environment variables to determine color support, attempts to import colorama and initialize it accordingly, and defines color constants. It uses environment variables and sys.stdout properties to decide whether to enable colors, with a fallback if colorama is not installed. There are no data leaks, injection points, or malicious logic. The code is straightforward and appears to serve formatting purposes without any malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for terminal color formatting, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
