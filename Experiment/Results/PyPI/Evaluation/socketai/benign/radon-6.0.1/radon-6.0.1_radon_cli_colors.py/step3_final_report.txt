  "purpose": "Defines constants and functions for terminal color formatting, influenced by environment variables and optional 'colorama' library.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'COLOR', import of 'colorama' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences 'colorama' initialization and color constants",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward environment and dependency handling",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility for terminal color configuration, with environment variable control and optional dependency import. It performs environment checks, initializes colorama if available, and defines color constants. No malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior is present. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The logic is standard and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. It functions solely as a configuration utility for terminal colors, with appropriate fallback handling. All reports correctly identify its safety and assign appropriate scores.",
