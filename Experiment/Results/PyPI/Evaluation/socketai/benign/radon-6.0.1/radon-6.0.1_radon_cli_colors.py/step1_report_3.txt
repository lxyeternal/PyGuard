{
  "purpose": "This module manages color formatting constants and logic for terminal output, including environment-based configuration and fallback handling.",
  "sources": "os.getenv('COLOR'), sys.stdout.isatty(), import colorama",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used to influence system state or perform harmful actions",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'COLOR' influences color support, which determines how colorama is initialized and how color constants are set",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code performs standard environment checks and conditional imports with fallback",
  "analysis": "The code checks environment variables and system properties to decide on color output, attempts to import colorama for terminal coloring, and defines constants for various colors. It includes a fallback if colorama is not installed. There are no dynamic code executions, data leaks, or malicious behaviors. All operations are standard for terminal formatting and environment handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focused on terminal color formatting, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
