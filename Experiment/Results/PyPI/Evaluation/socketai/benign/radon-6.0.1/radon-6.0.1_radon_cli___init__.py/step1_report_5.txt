{
  "purpose": "The code provides a command-line interface (CLI) for analyzing Python code metrics, including complexity, raw metrics, maintainability index, and Halstead metrics, using the radon library.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration files (pyproject.toml, radon.cfg, setup.cfg, ~/.radon.cfg), environment variables (RADONCFG), and command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Outputs analysis results to stdout or specified files; no untrusted data flows into system commands or network operations.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from files and environment variables into the Config object, then into analysis functions, with results formatted and written to streams or files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. Use of dynamic features (like inspect, open, sys) is standard for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical CLI implementation that loads configurations, performs code analysis using the radon library, and outputs results in various formats. It employs standard patterns like context managers, dynamic attribute access, and configuration merging from files and environment variables. No malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or malicious payloads are evident. The code does not include network connections, data exfiltration, or system harm mechanisms. It simply facilitates static code analysis.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a legitimate CLI tool for code metrics analysis with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. Its design focuses on configuration management and output formatting, consistent with a standard open-source utility.",
