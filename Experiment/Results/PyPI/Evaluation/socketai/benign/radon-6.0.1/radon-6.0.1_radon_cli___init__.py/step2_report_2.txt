  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a CLI for code metrics, reading environment variables, config files, and command-line args.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** File I/O, no external network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** No credentials, backdoors, malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis:** Standard static analysis setup; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, well-structured CLI utility.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues; the low security risk score aligns with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to above, standard configuration reading.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** File operations, no external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or network activity.\n- **Analysis:** Straightforward static analysis setup, standard libraries.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate CLI, no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with a benign tool; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same general purpose, reads configs/env/args.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Writes to stdout/files, no external data transmission.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Clear, standard CLI setup for static analysis.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate utility.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious behavior; scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, with environment variables and config files.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Output to stdout/files, no external network.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Typical CLI for code analysis, safe practices.\n- **Conclusion:** No security risks.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) but still very low, consistent with benign behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, configuration-driven static analysis.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Output streams, no network or external code execution.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** Standard CLI setup, no malicious features.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with a safe utility.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code presence & behavior:** All reports describe a standard CLI wrapper for static code analysis, relying on well-known libraries (`radon`, `mando`, `toml`, `configparser`) and typical patterns.\n- **Malware & obfuscation:** No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior across all reports.\n- **Risk scores:** Given the benign nature, the assigned malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately zero. The security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at **0** for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should remain at **0**.\n- **Risk score:** Given the absence of any malicious or suspicious activity, a risk score of **0.1** to **0.2** is reasonable, but could be slightly lowered to **0.1** if desired.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured CLI for static code analysis with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are consistent with this assessment.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the reports' findings.",
