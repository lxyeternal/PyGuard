{
  "purpose": "Create a command-line interface for analyzing Python code metrics such as complexity, maintainability, and Halstead metrics.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables (os.getenv), opening files ('pyproject.toml', configuration files, output files), loading modules (sys.modules), importing modules, and reading command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Writing to output streams (sys.stdout, files), calling external libraries (radon, mando), raising exceptions, and possibly opening files with open().",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or config files into internal configuration objects, then to the harvester objects which analyze code, and finally results are formatted and written to output streams.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code relies heavily on configuration files and environment variables, which is normal. No obfuscated or malicious code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a CLI with multiple commands for code analysis metrics, importing standard and third-party libraries without suspicious modifications. It reads configuration data from environment variables, config files, and command-line arguments, and outputs results accordingly. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The code does include standard file I/O and external library calls, but these are typical for such a CLI tool. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, unsafe eval, or obfuscated code are present. The code appears to be a legitimate CLI for static code analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a typical CLI setup for code metric analysis and configuration management. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It performs expected operations like reading configs, analyzing code, and outputting results securely. Overall, it poses no security risk.",
