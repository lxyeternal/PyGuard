  "purpose": "This code provides a CLI interface for analyzing Python code metrics such as complexity, maintainability index, raw metrics, and Halstead measures. It reads configuration from environment variables, configuration files, and command-line arguments to customize analysis options.",
  "sources": "Configuration files (e.g., radon.cfg, setup.cfg, pyproject.toml, ~/.radon.cfg), environment variables (RADONCFG), command-line arguments, and input paths for analysis.",
  "sinks": "File outputs (specified by output_file), stdout for displaying results, and formatted output in JSON, XML, Markdown, or codeclimate formats.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables, config files, and CLI arguments feed into configuration objects; these are used to initialize analysis harvesters, which process input paths and generate results that are then output to specified streams or files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The code uses standard libraries and practices typical for CLI tools.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI setup for static code analysis, utilizing well-known libraries and safe file operations. It reads configurations securely, performs analysis without network activity, and outputs results in various formats. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or obfuscation patterns are present. The structure and logic are clear and typical for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured CLI utility for static code analysis with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low risk score (~0.1-0.2) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
