{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to analyze Python code metrics, including Halstead metrics, maintainability index, and complexity measurements, mainly for code quality assessment.",
  "sources": "Input source code is parsed via ast.parse and analyzed using radon functions (analyze, ComplexityVisitor, HalsteadVisitor).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that handle untrusted data or perform external actions such as network communication, file writing, or system commands.",
  "flows": "The data flows from input code through AST parsing and metric computations, with no untrusted data being propagated to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code relies solely on metric calculations and standard libraries. No obfuscated language features or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code parses Python source code into an AST, performs static analysis using radon to calculate complexity, Halstead metrics, and maintainability indices. It employs standard mathematical formulas for these metrics without external data or network activity. No suspicious or malicious constructs are present; the functions are purely analytical and for code quality assessment. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated patterns are detected. The overall design is consistent with metric calculation modules, and there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of code metric analysis functions, with no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. It purely performs static analysis for code quality purposes.",
