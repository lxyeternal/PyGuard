{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to analyze Python code metrics such as Halstead metrics and Maintainability Index, primarily for code quality assessment.",
  "sources": "Reading input from code string via ast.parse and analyze() from radon.raw",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that execute untrusted data; calculations are internal and do not interact with external systems",
  "flows": "AST parsing and radon analysis flow into metric calculations; no external data flow or network activity observed",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments; no obfuscation or malicious logic detected",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly for static code analysis and metrics calculation, using radon library tools. It parses code into ASTs, performs complexity and Halstead metric calculations, and computes maintainability scores. No code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Functions utilize standard mathematical operations and well-known analysis techniques. No unusual code patterns, secrets, or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, legitimate implementation of code metrics analysis, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It primarily performs static analysis for code quality metrics, with no external or harmful actions.",
