{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions to analyze Python code for metrics like Halstead and Maintainability Index, mainly for code quality assessment.",
  "sources": "Code parsing via ast.parse, data analysis through radon.raw.analyze, and visitors for code complexity and Halstead metrics.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks present; the functions return numerical metrics or data structures. No untrusted data is written or sent over networks.",
  "flows": "Input source code -> parsed into AST -> analyzed for metrics -> metrics returned; no external data flows or untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. No dynamic code execution or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports established libraries and performs static analysis of Python code for complexity and maintainability metrics. It defines functions to parse code, analyze metrics, and compute the Maintainability Index. The functions are straightforward, with no evidence of data leaks, code injection, or malicious side effects. There are no network calls, file operations, or untrusted inputs that could lead to security risks. The code appears to serve purely analytical purposes with standard library usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing static code analysis for metrics without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security threats, malware, or supply chain attacks are evident.",
