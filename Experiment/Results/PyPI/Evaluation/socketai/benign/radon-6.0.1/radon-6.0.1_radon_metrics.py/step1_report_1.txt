{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for calculating various code metrics, such as Halstead metrics and Maintainability Index, for assessing code quality and complexity.",
  "sources": "The code reads input source code strings for analysis and parses them into ASTs.",
  "sinks": "The code does not include any direct data sinks that send data externally, such as network or file operations. No untrusted data output or system modification is present.",
  "flows": "Input source code → parse into AST → analyze metrics (Halstead, complexity, comments) → compute metrics like MI.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present. All operations are related to standard static code analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes established libraries (ast, radon) for static analysis without executing external or unsafe commands. It computes code complexity metrics and maintainability scores based on input code. No code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are observed. Functions perform purely analytical tasks, with no network, file, or environment variable access beyond standard library calls. The calculations and metrics are straightforward, and there are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for code metric analysis, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard, safe implementation for assessing code quality.",
