{
  "purpose": "The code calculates various software metrics such as Halstead and Maintainability Index metrics to analyze code complexity and quality.",
  "sources": "AST parsing of input code, analysis of comments and code structure, use of external libraries for analysis.",
  "sinks": "None of the code contains sinks that process untrusted input data leading to vulnerabilities or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input code is parsed into AST and analyzed; metrics are computed based on static analysis without executing or transmitting data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. Use of standard libraries and no obfuscated or malicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis to compute code metrics such as Halstead measures and Maintainability Index. It imports external libraries radon.raw and radon.visitors for code analysis, which are standard for such tasks. No code injection, network operations, data leakage, or malicious logic is present. Functions are straightforward, computing metrics based on code structure without executing external commands or manipulating data in insecure ways. The code does not contain any obfuscated patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code flows.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign static analysis module intended for measuring code complexity and quality metrics. It does not contain malware, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It appears safe for use in code quality assessments.",
