{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to analyze Python source code metrics, including Halstead metrics and Maintainability Index calculations, for static code quality assessment.",
  "sources": "Reads input code via ast.parse, analyzes code structure with radon.analyze, ComplexityVisitor, and HalsteadVisitor.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks; internal analysis only.",
  "flows": "Source: input code; sink: internal metric computations; flow: code parsed into AST, metrics computed, results returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis using standard libraries and external radon tools, with no external network or file operations. It calculates code complexity, Halstead metrics, and maintainability scores. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and intended solely for code quality assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility for code metrics, with no malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports correctly identify its safe nature, and the scoring is consistent with the code's functionality. No modifications are necessary.",
