{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for file handling, analysis, and formatting in the CLI tool, particularly for code complexity analysis and reporting.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (RADONFILESENCODING), file input streams, filename inputs, regex patterns, and external modules like sys, os, and locale.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations, file opening with specific encodings, reading the first line of files, generating strings for output (e.g., XML, Markdown, JSON), and hashing functions for fingerprints.",
  "flows": "Reading files (via open or _open functions) -> analyzing file content or metadata -> generating reports or hashes based on data -> outputting reports or data to strings or files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable for file encoding (though typical), extensive file handling with potential for reading untrusted files, use of regex to parse encoding declarations, and hashing of file paths with additional parts for fingerprinting. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed. The code's core logic is analysis and formatting, with no direct network or system manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code handles file I/O with care, supporting different Python versions and encodings, and utilizes environment variables for configuration. The functions related to file detection, encoding detection, and reading do not include any malicious or suspicious logic beyond standard file processing. Hashing functions are used for generating unique fingerprints for issues, which is a common practice in code analysis tools. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification behaviors are present. The code appears to be a utility module for static analysis and report generation, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a legitimate utility module designed for static code analysis reporting. It does not contain any malicious behavior or sabotage elements. The code functions as intended for analysis, formatting, and reporting, with standard practices for file handling and data processing.",
