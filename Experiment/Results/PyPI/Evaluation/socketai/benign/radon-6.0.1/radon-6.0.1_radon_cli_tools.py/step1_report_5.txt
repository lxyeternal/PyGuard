{
  "purpose": "The module provides utility functions for file handling, code analysis, and report generation related to Python code complexity and structure, used in a CLI context.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (RADONFILESENCODING), file reading operations, user input via filenames, and external package imports.",
  "sinks": "File opening functions, regex matching, and JSON/XML string generation; potential data flow from untrusted filenames or content to output.",
  "flows": "Filename input → file reading (via open functions) → code analysis functions → report or data output (JSON, XML, terminal strings).",
  "anomalies": "Complex handling of encoding detection and multiple open function implementations could obscure code intent; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily focused on safe file handling, code analysis, and report formatting. It dynamically manages file encodings, supports multiple Python versions, and processes source files and directories for Python code. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as network connections, data exfiltration, or system damage. The code uses standard libraries and well-documented patterns. No obfuscated or malicious payloads are present. The complex encoding detection code is standard and intended for robustness, not for malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate utility module for code analysis with no signs of malicious intent. Its complexity mainly stems from handling different Python environments and robust file reading mechanisms. There are no indications of malware or malicious data leaks.",
