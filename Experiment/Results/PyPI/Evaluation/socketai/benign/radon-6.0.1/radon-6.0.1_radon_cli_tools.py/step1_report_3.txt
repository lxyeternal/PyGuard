{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for analyzing Python source files, including file handling, code complexity analysis, and report generation for CLI and tools like Code Climate.",
  "sources": "File reading functions (_open, _is_python_file), environment variable (RADONFILESENCODING), and input data from source files or stdin.",
  "sinks": "Reading files (open, sys.stdin), regular expression matching, file path handling, JSON serialization, and network communication is not present. No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Source: File I/O or stdin → Processing/analysis functions → JSON/XML output generation; No data flows to network or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variable 'RADONFILESENCODING' to determine file encoding is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected. The code has extensive compatibility handling for different Python versions and platforms but nothing suspicious in itself.",
  "analysis": "The script is a utility module for static code analysis, focusing on file detection, reading, and analysis result formatting. It contains platform-specific handling for file opening and encoding detection, as well as functions for converting analysis results into various formats. No malicious code patterns, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The code is well-structured for its purpose, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden behaviors, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard utility module for code analysis and report formatting, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles file reading, encoding detection, and report generation securely and transparently.",
