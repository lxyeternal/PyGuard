  "purpose": "Utility functions for file handling, encoding detection, directory traversal, and report formatting in static analysis tools.",
  "sources": "File reads, environment variables, filename inputs, code content",
  "sinks": "File opening, JSON/XML/Markdown report generation, hashing for fingerprints",
  "flows": "File content read -> analysis -> report formatting",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for configuration, extensive compatibility handling, no suspicious code patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility module supporting multiple Python versions and platforms, with careful encoding detection and report formatting. No network activity, no data exfiltration, no hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are present. The environment variable usage is typical for configurable file encoding. The code is clear, well-structured, and free of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate utility code for static analysis and report formatting. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected.",
