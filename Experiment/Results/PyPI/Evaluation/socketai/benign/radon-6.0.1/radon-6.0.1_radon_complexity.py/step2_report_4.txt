  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** The code is a set of static utility functions for complexity analysis, no external or dynamic operations, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0 — no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.0 — justified, as there's no apparent security concern.  \n- **Comments:** The report is thorough, and the reasoning is sound. No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static analysis, no external data handling, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — consistent.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — very low, justified by the purely analytical nature.  \n- **Comments:** Slightly higher risk score than Report 1, but still reasonable given the context.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern—utility functions for static complexity analysis, no external interactions or suspicious code.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — consistent with previous reports.  \n- **Comments:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Again, standard static analysis utilities, no malicious features.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — matches the analysis.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — justified.  \n- **Comments:** Consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same as above, straightforward utility functions with no suspicious behavior.  \n- **Malware score:** 0 — correct.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation.  \n- **Risk score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. The code is purely static analysis utilities with no dynamic or malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated scores:** Correctly marked as 0, no obfuscation detected.  \n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0 or 0.1), justified given the nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — no signs of malware or malicious intent.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.0** — no obfuscation present.  \n- **Risk score:** **0.0 to 0.1** — all reports agree on minimal security risk, which is reasonable.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and justified. The code is a benign utility module for static code complexity analysis with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of my evaluation:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0 (or at most 0.1, but 0 is more appropriate given the evidence)\n\nThis assessment aligns with the detailed reasoning above.",
