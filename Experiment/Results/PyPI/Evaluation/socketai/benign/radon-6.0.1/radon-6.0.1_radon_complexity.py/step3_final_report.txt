{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for analyzing cyclomatic complexity of Python code, including ranking, sorting, and AST traversal, using the 'radon' library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the provided code string or AST nodes, primarily through static analysis functions and the 'radon' library.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code does not perform I/O, network operations, or data processing beyond static analysis.",
  "flows": "The data flows from input code or AST to the 'radon' analysis functions, then to sorting or ranking functions; no external or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and relies on standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static utility module for analyzing code complexity, relying on the 'radon' library. It performs mathematical calculations, sorting, and AST processing without dynamic or external data handling. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or obfuscation are detected. The functions serve their purpose as static analysis helpers, and there are no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static analysis utility with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.0-0.1) are consistent and appropriate given its purpose and implementation.",
