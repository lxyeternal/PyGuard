{
  "purpose": "Provides helper functions for analyzing and ranking cyclomatic complexity of Python code blocks, including sorting and traversal utilities.",
  "sources": "Imports from radon.visitors module; no external input sources; functions operate on passed code strings or AST nodes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data is written to external systems, files, or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "Function calls operate on code or AST objects; no flow of untrusted data to external systems or side-effects observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or backdoors identified. No dynamic code execution or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines utility functions for complexity analysis: ranking, averaging, sorting, and processing code blocks. All operations are static and do not interact with external data sources or sinks. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or sabotage features are present. The code relies on the 'radon' library for static analysis and does not perform any network operations, file handling, or dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of complexity analysis helpers with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It serves a purely analytical purpose, with no observable suspicious or harmful behavior.",
