  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the logic, and the scores assigned, especially regarding malware, obfuscation, and overall risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Summary:** The report states the code is purely utility functions for complexity analysis, with no external interactions or malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0.0, risk = 0.0  \n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, relies on the 'radon' library, and performs static analysis tasks. No suspicious behavior, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks.  \n- **Verdict:** **Consistent and accurate.** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static analysis, no external data handling, and standard utility functions.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0.0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1  \n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious activity. Slightly higher risk score (0.1) possibly due to general caution, but justified given the code's nature.  \n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate and reasonable.** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Summary:** Reiterates the benign nature, static analysis, no external or dynamic operations.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code's behavior.  \n- **Verdict:** **Accurate and justified.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Summary:** Same as above—utility functions for static complexity analysis, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.1  \n- **Assessment:** No issues.  \n- **Verdict:** **Correct and reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Summary:** Again, a benign utility module, no external data handling, no suspicious patterns.  \n- **Scores:** malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, risk = 0.0  \n- **Assessment:** Fully aligned with the code's purpose and behavior.  \n- **Verdict:** **Accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, which is consistent with the code's static, utility nature. No signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or payloads.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in most reports, reflecting a conservative stance on static analysis tools. This is reasonable given the context.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard utility module for code complexity analysis, relying on well-known libraries ('radon') and performing no dynamic or network operations.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The assigned scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **My Overall Estimate:**\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.0** — Clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1** — Slightly elevated due to the nature of static analysis tools, but still very low.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No adjustments needed.",
