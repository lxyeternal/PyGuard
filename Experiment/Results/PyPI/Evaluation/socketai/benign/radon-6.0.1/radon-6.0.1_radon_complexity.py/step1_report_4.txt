{
  "purpose": "Provides functions for analyzing and ranking cyclomatic complexity in Python code, specifically for use with the radon library.",
  "sources": "Imports from radon.visitors (GET_COMPLEXITY, ComplexityVisitor, code2ast), standard math module, no other data sources or input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process untrusted data, write to files, or send data over networks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the functions do not process untrusted input in a manner that leads to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated segments, or hidden behaviors detected. The code is straightforward utility functions for complexity analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines functions for computing and ranking cyclomatic complexity. It imports functions from an external library (radon) but does not perform any dynamic or system-level operations such as network access, file I/O, or executing untrusted code. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code flows. The functions operate on provided data structures and perform mathematical calculations and sorting, all within safe bounds. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for complexity analysis with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not include any suspicious or potentially harmful operations. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
