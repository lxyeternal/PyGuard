{
  "purpose": "The code provides helper functions for analyzing and ranking Cyclomatic Complexity of Python code blocks, functions, and classes using the radon library.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own source for functions, classes, and the imported radon library functions. No external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no operations that handle untrusted data, perform I/O, or send data over the network.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily processes static code structures for complexity analysis.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present. All code appears standard and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility module that uses radon to analyze code complexity. It defines functions for calculating complexity ranks, averaging complexities, sorting results, and adding inner blocks. There are no dynamic code execution, network communication, or data leakage mechanisms. The imports are standard for code analysis, and no external or untrusted inputs are handled.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign utility for code complexity analysis with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The code structure is clear and standard.",
