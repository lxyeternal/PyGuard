{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for analyzing cyclomatic complexity of Python code blocks, such as ranking, averaging, sorting, and visiting code structures.",
  "sources": "None of the functions or imports directly read untrusted input; functions operate on code strings or AST nodes provided by the caller.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data to perform dangerous actions like network access, file modification, or command execution.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code primarily manipulates data structures and ASTs without external side effects or data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are present. The functions are straightforward utility operations.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and third-party libraries for code complexity analysis and defines functions for ranking, averaging, sorting, and traversing code complexity data. No input/output operations, no external network or file interactions, and no dynamic code execution are evident. The code's purpose aligns with static analysis tooling. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are detected. The code appears well-structured and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a safe utility module for analyzing code complexity, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations or data exfiltration. The overall security risk score is low.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
