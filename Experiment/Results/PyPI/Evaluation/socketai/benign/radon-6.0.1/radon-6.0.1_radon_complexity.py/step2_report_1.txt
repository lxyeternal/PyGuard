  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's behavior, potential risks, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports consistently identify that the code is a static utility module for analyzing cyclomatic complexity.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or dynamic behaviors are reported.\n- The code relies on the 'radon' library for static analysis, with no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The malware score is 0 in all reports, aligning with the observations.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating no obfuscation detected.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0.1), reflecting minimal concern.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n- **Presence of issues:** The code does not perform any malicious actions, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration.\n- **Errors or flaws:** No logical errors or flaws are evident; the functions serve their purpose as static analysis helpers.\n- **Scores:** The malware and obfuscated scores are appropriately low. The risk scores are minimal, consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n- The reports are thorough and consistent. They correctly identify that the code is a benign utility module.\n- The highest risk score assigned is 0.1, which is reasonable given the nature of the code—static analysis tools are generally safe unless they process untrusted input or perform malicious actions, which is not the case here.\n- The malware scores are 0, correctly reflecting no malicious behavior.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made beyond the static analysis context, which is appropriate.\n\n### Potential areas for adjustment:\n- The reports could consider explicitly stating that the code does not process untrusted input or perform I/O operations that could be exploited.\n- The security risk scores could be uniformly set to 0.0 if the code is entirely static and does not handle external data, but 0.1 is still acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n**Risk score:** 0.0 or 0.1 — given the static nature, 0.0 is justified, but 0.1 remains acceptable as a conservative estimate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a benign static analysis utility with no malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary; the reports correctly identify the safety of the code.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0\n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis reflects the code's safety and benign purpose accurately.",
