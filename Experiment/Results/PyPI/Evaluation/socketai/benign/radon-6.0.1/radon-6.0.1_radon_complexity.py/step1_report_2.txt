{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for analyzing and ranking the cyclomatic complexity of Python code blocks, functions, and classes, primarily for code quality metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads imported modules (radon.visitors), and processes code input via the code2ast function and the cc_visit functions.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes or transmits data; no external system calls or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Code transforms source code into AST, analyzes complexity, and sorts or ranks blocks based on complexity metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. Use of lambda functions for simple sorting keys is standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly provides utility functions for complexity analysis, ranking, and organizing code blocks. It imports standard and third-party radon modules, performs sorting and ranking based on complexity scores, and processes nested code blocks. No network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution is present. The functions are straightforward, focusing on static analysis metrics. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or privacy violations are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for cyclomatic complexity analysis with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It appears to be legitimate, aiding code quality assessments without side effects.",
