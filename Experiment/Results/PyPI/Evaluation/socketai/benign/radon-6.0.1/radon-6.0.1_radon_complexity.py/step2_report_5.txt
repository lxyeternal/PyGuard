  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code to identify any inconsistencies, potential issues, or misalignments between the code and the reported security assessments.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code.**  \nThe code is a static utility module for analyzing cyclomatic complexity using the radon library. It performs ranking, sorting, averaging, and AST traversal. No dynamic code execution, external data handling, or network operations are present. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are evident.\n\n**Step 2: Check for errors, flaws, or logical mistakes in the reports.**  \nAll reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. They emphasize the static, analytical nature of the code, which aligns with its implementation.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned to malware, obfuscated, and security risk.**  \n- Malware score: All reports assign 0.0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n- Obfuscated: All assign 0.0, matching the straightforward nature of the code.  \n- Security risk: Mostly 0.0 or 0.1, indicating minimal or no risk. Given the code's static analysis purpose and lack of external interactions, this seems appropriate.\n\n**Step 4: Justify higher risk scores if assigned.**  \nNo report assigns a risk score above 0.1, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any operations that could be considered risky.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the reasonableness of the scores.**  \nAll scores are consistent with the code's nature. The extremely low or zero scores for malware and obfuscated code are justified. The minor security risk scores (0.1) are acceptable given the lack of external interactions but might be slightly conservative; however, they are not unreasonable.\n\n**Step 6: Challenge any assumptions or claims.**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is purely static analysis helpers with no malicious or suspicious behavior. No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made without basis.\n\n**Step 7: Final assessment and recommendations.**  \n- The code is safe, well-structured, and free of malicious content.  \n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent across reports.  \n- No modifications are necessary based on the provided information.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:** 0.0 — No malicious behavior detected.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.0 — Code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.  \n**Risk score:** 0.0 — The code is purely analytical with no external side effects or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns well with the code's characteristics. No security concerns are evident, and the code appears safe for use in any context involving static code analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nAlways ensure that dependencies like `radon` are from trusted sources and kept up to date, but based solely on this code snippet and reports, there are no security issues.",
