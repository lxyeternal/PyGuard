{
  "purpose": "Main entry point for a command line interface, invoking the radon CLI program.",
  "sources": "Reads command line arguments via sys.argv, imports program and log_error from radon.cli.",
  "sinks": "Calls program() which may execute commands based on input; logs errors via log_error.",
  "flows": "Command line args -> program() execution; Exceptions caught -> log_error(e).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles command line arguments, appends '-h' if none provided, and calls radon.cli.program(). It catches exceptions and logs errors. No untrusted data sources or sinks that lead to data exfiltration or system compromise are evident. The code structure appears standard for CLI entry points, with no suspicious behaviors or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI wrapper for the radon tool with no malicious intent. It handles arguments and errors in a typical manner without security concerns.",
