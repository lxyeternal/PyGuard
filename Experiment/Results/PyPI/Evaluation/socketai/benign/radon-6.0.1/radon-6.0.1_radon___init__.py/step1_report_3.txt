{
  "purpose": "Provides the main entry point for a command-line interface, wrapping the 'radon' package functions.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'program()' from radon.cli, potentially executing user commands; logs errors via 'log_error()'.",
  "flows": "sys.argv inputs -> program() execution; Exceptions -> log_error().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, serving as a CLI wrapper for the radon package. It modifies command-line arguments if none are provided, then executes 'program()'. Error handling logs exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code. No external network communication or suspicious activities are visible.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple CLI launcher for the radon tool. It does not contain any malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears safe and standard for its purpose.",
