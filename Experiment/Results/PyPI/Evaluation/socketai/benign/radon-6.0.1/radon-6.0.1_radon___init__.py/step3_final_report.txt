{
  "purpose": "This code serves as the main entry point for a command line interface, handling argument parsing and invoking the 'program' function from 'radon.cli'.",
  "sources": "Reads command line arguments via sys.argv; imports 'program' and 'log_error' from 'radon.cli'.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'program()' which executes the main CLI logic; logs exceptions with 'log_error()'.",
  "flows": "sys.argv is checked and possibly appended with '-h'; then 'program()' is called; exceptions are caught and passed to 'log_error()'.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard argument handling and exception logging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal CLI wrapper that appends '-h' if no arguments are provided, then executes 'program()' from 'radon.cli', catching and logging any exceptions. It contains no hardcoded secrets, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The structure and behavior are typical for CLI entry points, with exception handling and argument management. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present, and the code is clear and simple.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1) are appropriate and justified based on the code's straightforward nature.",
