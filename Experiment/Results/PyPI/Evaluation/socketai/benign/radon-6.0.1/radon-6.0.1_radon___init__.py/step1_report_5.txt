{
  "purpose": "The module serves as the command line interface entry point for a package that uses Radon for code analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads command line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Calls the program() function from radon.cli, and logs errors via log_error",
  "flows": "sys.argv input → program() execution; exceptions → log_error",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code structures observed. The code is straightforward and standard for CLI entry points.",
  "analysis": "The code checks for command line arguments, appends '-h' if none are provided, and then runs the main program. Exception handling captures and logs any errors. The code relies on external 'radon.cli' functions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The structure is typical for CLI entry points, with no hidden or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign CLI entry point with no malicious intent. It properly manages command line input and error logging without any suspicious or malicious code segments.",
