{
  "purpose": "Main entry point for a command line interface, invoking Radon CLI program functionality.",
  "sources": "Reads command line arguments via sys.argv; imports sys, radon.cli.program, and radon.cli.log_error.",
  "sinks": "Calls program() which may process input; logs errors through log_error(). No explicit data sinks such as network or file writes are evident.",
  "flows": "Command line arguments are processed and passed to radon.cli.program; exceptions caught and logged via log_error.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code features. The only notable aspect is the automatic addition of '-h' if no args are provided, which is standard CLI behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily serves as a wrapper to invoke the Radon CLI program. It handles missing arguments by appending '-h' for help. Exception handling captures all exceptions and logs them, which is standard practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is detected. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or hidden malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This script acts as a simple CLI wrapper for Radon with standard argument handling and error logging. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The code is benign and typical for CLI entry points.",
