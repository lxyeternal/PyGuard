  "purpose": "Main entry point for a command line interface, invoking Radon CLI functions.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command line arguments), import statements (import sys, radon.cli).",
  "sinks": "program() function call, log_error() function call.",
  "flows": "sys.argv is used to determine command line input; program() executes Radon CLI; exceptions caught and logged via log_error.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a CLI tool, handling command line arguments. It appends '-h' to sys.argv if no arguments are provided, then calls the 'program()' function from radon.cli. Exceptions during execution are logged with 'log_error'. The code appears standard for CLI entry points, with no suspicious behaviors, network activity, or malicious code evident. Import statements are straightforward, and control flow is simple and typical for CLI scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard CLI entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly forwards control to Radon CLI functions, with basic error logging. No anomalies or malware indications detected.",
