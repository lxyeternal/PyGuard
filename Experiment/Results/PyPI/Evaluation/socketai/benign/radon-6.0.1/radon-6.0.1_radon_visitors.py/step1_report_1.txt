{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for analyzing Python code complexity and Halstead metrics, primarily for static analysis purposes.",
  "sources": "Code reads source code via ast.parse, and within methods like from_code, from_ast, and the visit methods that process AST nodes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks are present; no untrusted data is sent over networks, written to files, or executed dynamically.",
  "flows": "The code processes input source code into AST, traverses the AST to compute complexity metrics, and accumulates operator/operand data for Halstead metrics.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns observed. No use of dynamic code execution (e.g., eval, exec). The code appears to perform static analysis only.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static analysis tool for measuring code complexity and Halstead metrics. It uses ast.NodeVisitor subclasses to traverse AST nodes, compute decision points, and collect operator/operand counts. No network or file I/O, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious code patterns are found. The code is well-structured and uses standard Python modules; it does not include obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static analysis utility designed to measure code complexity metrics. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or data exfiltration mechanisms. It solely performs computational analysis without side effects.",
