  "purpose": "Static analysis utility for measuring Cyclomatic Complexity and Halstead metrics in Python source code.",
  "sources": "AST nodes representing functions, classes, and code constructs during traversal.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or network interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Analysis flows from source nodes (functions, classes) through AST traversal to compute metrics; no untrusted data flows or external effects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static AST traversal to compute complexity metrics, with clear, well-structured classes and methods. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external interactions are present. The malware score is appropriately zero; the obfuscation score is zero; the risk score is minimal (0 or 0.1), reflecting the benign nature of static analysis tools. The high confidence score (1) is justified by the straightforward, transparent implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static analysis utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign purpose.",
