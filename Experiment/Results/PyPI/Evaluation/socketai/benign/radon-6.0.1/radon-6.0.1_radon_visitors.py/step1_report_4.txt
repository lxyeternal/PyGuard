{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions to analyze Python source code for complexity metrics, Halstead metrics, and structural analysis using AST traversal. It is intended for code quality and maintainability assessments.",
  "sources": "AST parsing of source code, AST node attributes (e.g., 'lineno', 'col_offset'), class attributes, method calls, and data collections within visitors.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no functions writing data externally, executing commands, or network activity are detected.",
  "flows": "AST nodes are visited; complexity and metric data flow from AST node analysis to internal data structures, with no external data flows or untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious dynamic code execution, or backdoors are present. The code appears straightforward for complexity analysis. No obfuscated code or suspicious pattern detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis of Python source by parsing it into an AST and then traversing it with specialized visitors: ComplexityVisitor for cyclomatic complexity and CodeVisitor subclasses for Halstead metrics. It uses namedtuples to represent functions and classes, computes various complexity metrics, and handles nested structures recursively. There are no signs of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure and behavior align with legitimate static code analysis tools.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, well-structured static analysis module focused on code metrics. No malicious behavior or sabotage is detected. The code solely performs metrics collection without any suspicious side-effects.",
