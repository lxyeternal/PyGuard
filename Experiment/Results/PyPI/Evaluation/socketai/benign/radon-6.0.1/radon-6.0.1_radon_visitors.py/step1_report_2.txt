{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and functions for analyzing Python source code to calculate cyclomatic and Halstead complexity metrics, including representation of functions and classes, and visiting AST nodes to gather data.",
  "sources": "Reads source code via 'from_code' and 'from_ast' class methods; uses 'ast.parse' to convert code into AST; traverses AST nodes during visitor patterns.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process or output untrusted data; no network or file writing operations; no system commands or external calls.",
  "flows": "Input source code -> convert to AST -> AST traversal in visitors -> collection of metrics and code structure data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. The code is primarily analytical and structurally oriented. No unusual or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a structured approach to AST traversal for complexity analysis with classes for functions and classes, including their full names and complexity metrics. It employs static analysis techniques, such as counting decision points for cyclomatic complexity and operator/operand analysis for Halstead metrics. All functions and classes serve legitimate analytical purposes without any indications of malicious behavior. There are no external calls, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code's use of standard libraries and typical pattern of AST analysis strongly suggests benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard code analysis tool for computing code complexity metrics. It does not contain any malicious behavior, backdoors, or security threats. The code is well-structured for its purpose and does not perform any suspicious or harmful actions.",
