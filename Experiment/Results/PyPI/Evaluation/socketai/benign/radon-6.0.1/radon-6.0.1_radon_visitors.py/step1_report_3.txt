{
  "purpose": "This module provides classes and functions for analyzing Python code complexity and metrics such as Cyclomatic Complexity and Halstead metrics, primarily for static code analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from source code strings passed to `from_code` and `from_ast` methods, and from AST nodes during traversal.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in the code; no data is written to external systems, networks, or files. No untrusted data is processed in a way that could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source functions `from_code` and `from_ast` into AST traversal methods which analyze code structure; no external or dangerous data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is standard for static analysis; no suspicious or unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or backdoors are present. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for static code metrics analysis, including complexity and Halstead metrics. It employs safe AST traversal without executing or evaluating untrusted code. No network, file, or environment interactions are present. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote connections, or backdoors are detected. The structure and functionality align with legitimate static analysis tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign static code analysis module for Python, with no malicious or sabotage behavior. It uses well-known patterns for AST traversal and metric calculation. There are no signs of malware or security risks in this code fragment.",
