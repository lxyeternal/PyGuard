{
  "purpose": "This module provides classes for analyzing Python code complexity and Halstead metrics, primarily for static code analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from AST nodes during traversal (e.g., function definitions, class definitions, control structures). It also reads class attributes and node properties such as 'lineno', 'body', 'handlers', etc.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code does not handle untrusted input, nor does it perform network operations, file I/O, or system commands.",
  "flows": "The data flows from AST nodes (sources) during traversal into internal data structures like functions and classes for complexity and metric calculations. No external data flow is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The code appears to be a standard static analysis tool for code metrics.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data structures for functions and classes, and provides visitors for calculating cyclomatic complexity (ComplexityVisitor) and Halstead metrics (HalsteadVisitor). It performs AST traversal, collecting metrics without any side effects or external operations. The use of static properties, straightforward class methods, and normal AST node processing indicates no obfuscation or malicious intent. The code focuses on analysis, not execution or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static analysis utility for computing code complexity and metrics. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. It appears to be safe and purely analytical.",
