{
  "purpose": "Defines constants, enums, and data models for Gencove CLI, including API endpoints, statuses, and configuration options.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions, Enum classes, and data models; no external or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static constants and enum definitions do not process external input directly.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow or untrusted input processing; the code is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, such as hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code. All constants and enums appear standard and related to API interactions. No dynamic code execution or data manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively declares static constants, enums, and data models for API endpoints and configuration. There are no input/output operations, network connections, or data handling logic that could be exploited. All elements serve as structured configurations and constants, with no signs of malicious intent. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and consistent with standard API client setup.\n\nThere are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system manipulation beyond defining constants and models.\n\nOverall, this code is purely declarative, intended for configuration and API referencing, with no malicious components detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a safe, non-malicious configuration module defining constants and enums for the Gencove CLI. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
