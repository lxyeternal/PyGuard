  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of the reports:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a static configuration module defining constants, enums, and data models for the Gencove CLI.\n- No input/output processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The purpose is purely declarative, serving as structured configuration and API endpoint references.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Confirm if issues are present in the code\n- The code is static, with no signs of issues or vulnerabilities.\n- No runtime or dynamic behavior, so no issues are present.\n\n### Step 2: Identify errors, flaws, or mistakes\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident.\n- The code is well-structured and adheres to standard practices.\n- The only minor note is a typo in `PIPELINE_CAPABILITES` (should be `PIPELINE_CAPABILITIES`), but this is a spelling mistake, not a security flaw.\n\n### Step 3: Review scores assigned\n- All reports give malware = 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are also 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n- Confidence is high (1), which seems justified.\n\n### Step 4: Justify risk scores higher than 0.5\n- Since the code is purely static configuration with no dynamic or executable components, the risk score should remain at 0.\n- No indication of vulnerabilities, malware, or malicious intent.\n\n### Step 5: Challenge claims based on assumptions\n- The reports do not assume any vulnerabilities; they are cautious and thorough.\n- No assumptions about malicious intent are made; all findings are consistent.\n\n### Step 6: Consistency of scores\n- The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The typo in `PIPELINE_CAPABILITES` should be corrected to `PIPELINE_CAPABILITIES`, but this is a minor issue unrelated to security.\n- The code is a standard constants and enum definitions module, with no vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\nThe code is a safe, well-structured static configuration module with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware and risk.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThese reflect the code's nature as purely static configuration with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
