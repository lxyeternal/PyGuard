{
  "purpose": "Defines constants, enums, and data models for the Gencove CLI, including API endpoints, status indicators, and configuration options.",
  "sources": "Constants, enum definitions, and data model classes; no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points for untrusted data; primarily static configuration and data definitions.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. Usage of static constants and enums is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static definitions including API endpoints, enums for various statuses, configuration constants, and data models for credentials and options. It does not perform any network communication, file I/O, or data processing. No input validation, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated or suspicious code structures are present. All constants and models are well-structured and do not exhibit malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical configuration and constants module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains static definitions for API routes, status enums, and data models, which are standard for SDKs or CLI tools. No malicious or maliciously obfuscated code is present.",
