  "purpose": "Static configuration module defining constants, API endpoints, enums, and data models for the Gencove CLI.",
  "sources": "Constants, enum definitions, and data models within the code; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Static data definitions; no data flow from source to sink involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and well-structured. Minor typo in 'PIPELINE_CAPABILITES' noted but not security-related.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, defining constants, enums, and data models for API interaction. It contains no dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscated elements. No hardcoded secrets beyond API paths are present. The structure and content are typical for SDKs or CLI tools. All security and malware scores are 0, with high confidence, reflecting the benign, configuration-only nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe configuration module with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with its static, declarative purpose.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
