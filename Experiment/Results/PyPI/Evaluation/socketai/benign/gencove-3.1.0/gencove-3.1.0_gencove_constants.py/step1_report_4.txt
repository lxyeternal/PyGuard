  "purpose": "Define constants, enums, and data models for Gencove CLI, including API endpoints, statuses, and configuration options.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions (HOST, MAX_RETRY_TIME_SECONDS, etc.), enum members, and class attributes (Credentials, Optionals).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly involve untrusted data processing or external output; no data is processed or transmitted within this code.",
  "flows": "The code sets up static configuration and schema; no dynamic data flow or input validation is present here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. Constants and enum values are straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static constants, enum definitions, and simple data models used for configuration and API interactions. No external inputs are handled, and no data is transmitted or processed in an unsafe manner. The HOST is a publicly accessible URL; no secrets are hardcoded beyond standard API endpoint paths and configuration values. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious code is present. The code appears to be standard, well-structured configuration setup for a CLI tool, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical constants and enum setup for a CLI application, with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It contains no secrets or sensitive information, and all elements serve configuration or descriptive purposes.",
