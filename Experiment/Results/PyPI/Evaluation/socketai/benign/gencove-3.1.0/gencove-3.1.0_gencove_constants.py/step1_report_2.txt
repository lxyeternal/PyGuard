  "purpose": "Define constants, enums, and data models for Gencove CLI, including API endpoints, statuses, and configuration options.",
  "sources": "Constant string definitions, Enum classes, and Pydantic data models.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data; the code primarily defines static constants and data structures.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks, as the code does not handle input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The constants and models appear standard and non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of constant definitions, enum classes, and data models used for API interaction and configuration within a CLI. No network connections, data transmissions, or code execution features are present. The API endpoints are static and do not include any dynamic or suspicious URLs. The data models include standard fields like email, password, API keys, and optional host configurations, which are typical for authentication modules. The code does not contain any obfuscated or misleading logic. All elements align with legitimate configuration and enum usage, with no signs of malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration and data model module for the Gencove CLI. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is safe and intended for defining constants and structures.",
