  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a static configuration module defining constants, API endpoints, enums, and data models.\n- No external data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious code structures are detected.\n- The code is standard for SDKs or CLI tools, with well-structured enums and data models.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0.\n- Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), indicating consistent assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Logical Checks:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  No. The code is purely static configuration and data models, with no signs of issues or vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  None detected. The code is well-structured, with proper use of enums, constants, and data models.\n\n- **Scores assigned to issues?**  \n  All reports assign malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n- **Are any higher risk scores justified?**  \n  No. The code is purely declarative and does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks.\n\n- **Malware considerations?**  \n  No malicious activity or payloads are present. The code does not perform any network calls, file I/O, or code execution.\n\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities?**  \n  No assumptions are made; the analysis correctly identifies the code as benign.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the code?**  \n  Yes. The scores are consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n\nGiven the comprehensive review, **the code is a standard constants and configuration module** for a CLI tool. It contains no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The high confidence scores are justified.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese scores accurately reflect the code's benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is safe, straightforward, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements.",
