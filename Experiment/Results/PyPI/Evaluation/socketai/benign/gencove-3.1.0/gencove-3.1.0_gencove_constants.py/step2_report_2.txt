  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Static constants, API endpoint URLs, enums for statuses, data models for credentials and options.\n- No dynamic code, no network calls, no input validation beyond data models.\n- No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets beyond API paths, no malicious patterns.\n- Purpose appears to be configuration and type definitions for a CLI interacting with Gencove's API.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- All constants and models are static, well-structured, and serve configuration purposes.\n- No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious logic.\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes:\n- No logical flaws or errors are evident.\n- The code appears complete and correct for its purpose.\n- No invalid syntax or insecure practices are present.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. The code is not malicious.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, correct, as there's no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified given the static, configuration-only nature.\n\n### Justification for risk score > 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; the code is purely static configuration with no dynamic or risky operations.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores across reports are consistent with the code's nature.\n- No inconsistencies or unreasonable score assignments are observed.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code does not process untrusted data, nor does it contain any network or file I/O.\n- The only potential concern could be if these constants were misused elsewhere, but within this code snippet, there's no evidence of that.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0\n\n**Reasoning:**  \nThe code is a standard, static configuration module with no malicious or risky components. All elements are typical for API client setup and do not introduce security concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate in their assessment.\n- No changes needed; the code is safe.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' evaluations.**",
