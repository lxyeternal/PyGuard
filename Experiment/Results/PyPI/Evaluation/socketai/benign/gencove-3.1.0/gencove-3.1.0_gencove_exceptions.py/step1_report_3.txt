  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Gencove CLI to handle validation and maintenance errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and __init__ methods for ValidationError and MaintenanceError.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted inputs are processed or used in a vulnerable manner.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; exception classes are simple and only store messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors observed. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exceptions inheriting from Exception, with constructors that set message and eta attributes. These are standard Python patterns for exception handling. No external inputs are processed or executed. The code does not perform any network operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. It is straightforward and only provides error class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and only defines exception classes for CLI error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
