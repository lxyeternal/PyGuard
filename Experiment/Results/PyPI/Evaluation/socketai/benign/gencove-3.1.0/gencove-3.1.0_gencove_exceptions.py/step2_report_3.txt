  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code consists solely of two simple custom exception class definitions with straightforward constructors.\n   - No external data handling, network communication, or code execution occurs.\n   - No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident.\n   - All reports agree on the benign nature of this code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify that these are standard exception class definitions with no malicious intent.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n   - The conclusions are justified based on the code's simplicity and standard pattern.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated code, and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The confidence scores are at maximum (1), reflecting certainty about the benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scoring aligns well with the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The risk scores are all 0, which is justified given the benign nature.\n   - No further justification needed.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Summary of My Evaluation:**\n- The code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present.\n- The reports are accurate and well-justified.\n\n**My Own Estimated Scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final Note:**\nThis code is benign and does not pose any security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and justified based on the code's simplicity and purpose.",
