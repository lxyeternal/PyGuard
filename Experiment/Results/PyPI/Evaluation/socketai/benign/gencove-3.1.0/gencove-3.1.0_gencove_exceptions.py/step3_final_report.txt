  "purpose": "Define common exceptions in Gencove CLI.",
  "sources": "Class definitions of ValidationError and MaintenanceError, including their __init__ methods.",
  "sinks": "No external data, input, or output handling; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception objects with message and optional eta attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs; straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with standard __init__ methods setting message attributes and an optional eta. There are no external data flows, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The code is standard, benign, and serves error handling purposes. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security risk. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
