  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for CLI validation and API maintenance errors.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their constructors, using standard Python exception inheritance.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication; constructors only initialize attributes.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes with messages, but no data flows or external data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected; simple exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with standard __init__ methods. No external data inputs, network calls, or code injection points. No malicious or suspicious activity observed. The code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of custom error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is clean, simple, and appropriate for its purpose.",
