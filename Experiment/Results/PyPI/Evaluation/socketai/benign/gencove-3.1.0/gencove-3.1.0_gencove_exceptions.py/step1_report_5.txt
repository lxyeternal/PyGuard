  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions for Gencove CLI to handle validation errors and maintenance states.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and __init__ methods that initialize exception messages and optional ETA.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Initialization of exception objects with messages and ETA; no data flow from external sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code; the code simply defines exception classes with message handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. Each class initializes with optional message parameters, storing messages and ETA where applicable. No external input handling, no data processing, and no suspicious logic are present. The code appears straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and intended to define custom exception types for a CLI tool. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
