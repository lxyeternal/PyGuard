  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for Gencove CLI to handle validation and maintenance errors.",
  "sources": "Exception class definitions, __init__ methods setting message and eta attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from constructor parameters to class attributes; no external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. Each class has an __init__ method that sets message attributes, which is standard practice for exception handling. There are no external data reads, network operations, or code execution activities. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears to be straightforward and well-structured for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple class definitions for custom exceptions, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
