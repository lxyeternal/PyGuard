  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the scoring, and the security implications.\n\n**Step 1: Confirm presence of issues in the code**\n\n- The code consists solely of two custom exception classes, `ValidationError` and `MaintenanceError`, each with straightforward `__init__` methods setting message attributes (and `eta` for `MaintenanceError`).\n- No external data handling, network calls, or data flows are present.\n- No suspicious or malicious code constructs are evident.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign and performs a standard role of defining custom exceptions.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the reasoning, logic, and summaries in the reports**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is simple, standard, and free of malicious activity.\n- They correctly identify that no external data, network operations, or data leaks are involved.\n- The analysis in each report is consistent and thorough, with no contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Review the scores assigned**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All assign 0, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security risk scores:** All assign 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Step 4: Justify any higher risk scores**\n\n- Since the code is purely class definitions with no external data or suspicious behavior, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n- The malware score of 0 is correct; there's no malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score of 0 is correct; no obfuscation is present.\n- The security risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Step 5: Cross-check for assumptions or claims**\n\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the code is straightforward.\n- No external inputs or data flows are involved, so no vulnerabilities are implied.\n- The reports correctly avoid speculative claims.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n**Overall:** The reports are accurate, consistent, and justified. The code is a simple, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the thorough review, I concur with the existing scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are correct, and the scores are appropriate.
