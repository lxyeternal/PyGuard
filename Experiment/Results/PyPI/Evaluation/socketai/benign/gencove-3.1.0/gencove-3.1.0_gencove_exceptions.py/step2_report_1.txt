  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report and the code snippets they describe.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe provided code defines two custom exception classes:\n- `ValidationError`, which indicates invalid CLI command input.\n- `MaintenanceError`, which indicates the backend API is under maintenance, optionally including an ETA.\n\nBoth classes inherit from Python's built-in `Exception` and have straightforward `__init__` methods that set message attributes (and `eta` for `MaintenanceError`). The code is simple, standard, and serves a clear purpose in error handling.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n**Reports 1-5:**\n- **Purpose:** All reports correctly identify that these are custom exception classes for CLI validation and API maintenance errors.\n- **Sources:** They correctly point out the class definitions and their constructors.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling, input/output, or network communication occurs.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious or anomalous behavior detected; the code is standard and straightforward.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** All reports agree that the code is benign, standard, and serves its purpose without security issues.\n\n**Overall consensus:** The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is simple exception class definitions with no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring Justification\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`. This is appropriate; there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign `0`, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk Score:** All assign `0`, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Potential Issues or Concerns\n- No issues or vulnerabilities are present.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, perform network calls, or execute code dynamically.\n- Exception classes are standard practice and pose no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment\n\n**Given the analysis:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n| Malware Score | Obfuscated Score | Risk Score |\n|-----------------|-------------------|------------|\n| 0               | 0                 | 0          |\n\nThese reflect the benign, non-malicious nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n- **Confirmed issues:** None.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- **Overall security stance:** Safe, standard exception class definitions.\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure that exception classes are used properly elsewhere in the codebase to handle errors securely, but based solely on this snippet, there are no security concerns.",
