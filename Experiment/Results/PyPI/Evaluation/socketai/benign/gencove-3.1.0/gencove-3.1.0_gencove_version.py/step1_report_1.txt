  "sinks": "Return statement concatenating decoded data into version string",
  "flows": "pkgutil.get_data() reads data (sources) -> decode() -> concatenate into version string (sink)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. Uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves version components stored as data files within the package, decodes them from UTF-8, and constructs a version string. No external input, no network calls, and no suspicious logic or obfuscation. The usage of pkgutil.get_data() is standard for embedded package resources.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, intended to generate a version string from embedded package data. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign utility function.",
