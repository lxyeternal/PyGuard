  "purpose": "Utility function to generate a version string based on stored data files.",
  "sources": "pkgutil.get_data() calls reading data from package resources 'version/A-major', 'version/B-minor', 'version/C-patch'.",
  "targets": "The decoded version components returned as a concatenated string.",
  "flows": "pkgutil.get_data() reads version parts -> .strip() removes whitespace -> .decode('utf-8') converts bytes to string -> formatted into version string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious file paths, or unusual code constructs. Usage of get_data() to read version info is typical. No dynamic code execution or external network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves version components from package resource files using pkgutil.get_data(). It then strips whitespace and decodes the byte data into UTF-8 strings before concatenating into a version string. The approach is standard for version management, with no signs of malicious behavior. The code relies on data stored within the package, not external input, reducing attack surface. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward utility to construct a version string from package resource files. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware activity, or security risks. It is safe and typical for version management purposes.",
