  "purpose": "Utility to generate version string for the package based on embedded data files.",
  "sources": "Reads data from embedded files within the package at 'version/A-major', 'version/B-minor', and 'version/C-patch'.",
  "sinks": "Returns a formatted version string; does not output or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Reads data from embedded version files and decodes them to construct version string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. Uses standard library functions appropriately.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves version components from internal data files using pkgutil.get_data, then decodes and concatenates them into a version string. No external network calls, data leakage, or suspicious behavior observed. The approach is typical for internal version management. The only potential concern is if the data files contain maliciously crafted content, but this is standard and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility to generate a version string from embedded data files, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
