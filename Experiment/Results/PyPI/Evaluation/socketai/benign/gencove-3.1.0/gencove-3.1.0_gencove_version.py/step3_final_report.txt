  "purpose": "Retrieve version string components from internal package data files and assemble into a version string.",
  "sources": "pkgutil.get_data() reads data files 'version/A-major', 'version/B-minor', 'version/C-patch' within the package.",
  "sinks": "Decoding and stripping data, then concatenating into a string; no untrusted data processing or external outputs.",
  "flows": "Data files -> get_data() -> decode() -> strip() -> format into version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward data retrieval and string formatting; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code reads embedded version components from package resources, decodes from UTF-8, strips whitespace, and constructs a version string. It does not process external input, perform network activity, or execute code dynamically. The data files are internal, likely controlled, and used solely for versioning. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The only potential concern is if the data files are maliciously crafted, but this is external to the code logic and a standard supply chain consideration. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1) to account for external data integrity concerns, but the code itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard utility for version string generation from internal package data. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
