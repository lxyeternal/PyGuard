  "purpose": "Utility to generate a version string based on embedded version data files within the package.",
  "sources": "Reads data from package resources: 'version/A-major', 'version/B-minor', 'version/C-patch'.",
  "sinks": "Returns a formatted version string; does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Reads package resource data and decodes them to form a version string.",
  "anomalies": "Uses pkgutil.get_data() to read internal package files; no external input or network activity; straightforward usage.",
  "analysis": "The code reads version components from package resource files and constructs a version string. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, untrusted input, or malicious behavior. The use of pkgutil.get_data() is standard for embedded package data. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are evident. The code performs a simple and safe operation, with no external data flows or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for retrieving version information from package resources. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
