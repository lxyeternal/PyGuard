  "purpose": "Utility to generate a version string based on data retrieved from package resources.",
  "sources": "pkgutil.get_data(__package__, ...)",
  "sinks": "Return statement using decoded data, which could be used elsewhere, but no direct sink for untrusted data is present.",
  "flows": "pkgutil.get_data() retrieves data from package resources, then decode() converts bytes to string, and formatted into version string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or unusual code patterns. The use of package data to determine version is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkgutil to access package data files for version components. It retrieves data for major, minor, and patch versions from specified resource paths, strips whitespace, decodes from UTF-8, and constructs a version string. The code appears straightforward and typical for version retrieval. No user input, external network access, or obfuscation is present. No malicious intent or backdoors are evident. The approach is consistent with common versioning practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility to generate version strings from package data files. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
