{
  "purpose": "Provides collection utilities, including custom lazy evaluation mechanisms.",
  "sources": "The generator passed to LazyList during initialization.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not send data externally or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "Generator produces items -> __getitem__, __iter__, or __len__ access cached or new items.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard lazy evaluation wrapper around a generator, caching items for repeated access. It handles generator exhaustion properly, and no external data transmission or malicious behavior is present. The implementation is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or security vulnerabilities. All available reports agree on its benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The generator source is external, but the class itself is safe and does not introduce malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented utility for lazy evaluation with no security risks or malicious intent. The existing reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to scores are necessary.",
