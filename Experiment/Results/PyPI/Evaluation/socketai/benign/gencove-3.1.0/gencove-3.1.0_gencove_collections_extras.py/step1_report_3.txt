{
  "purpose": "Provides a collection utility class 'LazyList' that allows lazy evaluation and caching of generator elements.",
  "sources": "Generator input to LazyList constructor, especially in __init__ and __len__ methods when extending cache.",
  "sinks": "None evident; the class does not write data to external sources or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Generator produces items on demand during __getitem__, __iter__, and __len__; cached locally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual dynamic execution, no backdoors, no malicious data leakage.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a lazy evaluation wrapper around a generator, with caching to avoid recomputation. It reads data solely from the provided generator and manages internal state safely. No external input/output, no system calls, and no insecure operations are present. The logic appears standard for such a utility class.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward utility for lazy evaluation and caching of generator data with no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
