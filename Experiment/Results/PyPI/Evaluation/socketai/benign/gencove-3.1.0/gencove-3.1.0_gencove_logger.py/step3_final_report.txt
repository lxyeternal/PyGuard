  "purpose": "Utility functions for logging, output styling, and debug log management.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (LOG_LEVEL, GENCOVE_SAVE_DUMP_LOG), datetime, uuid, platform, sys, os, open file operations.",
  "sinks": "Writing logs to disk in .logs directory, console output via click.echo, styling output with click.style.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence log level; logs are timestamped and stored in files; logs are output to console with styling; debug logs are accumulated in memory.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets; directory creation is standard; no network activity or credential handling; no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward logging utility for CLI applications, using environment variables for configuration, timestamped logs, and styled console output. It manages debug logs in memory and writes them to disk if enabled. No network, credential, or malicious activity is present. The use of standard libraries and practices indicates benign intent. The environment variable reliance and file operations are typical and not suspicious. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured logging utility with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk score (~0.1) are justified and appropriate.",
