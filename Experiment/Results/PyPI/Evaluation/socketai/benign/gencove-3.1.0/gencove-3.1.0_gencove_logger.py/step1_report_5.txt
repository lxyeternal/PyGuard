  "purpose": "Utilities for logging and output formatting, including debug, info, warning, and error messages for CLI tools.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., GENCOVE_LOG, GENCOVE_SAVE_DUMP_LOG), system time and UUID generation, platform info, external libraries (click, boto3).",
  "sinks": "Logging output, file writing for debug logs, console output via click.echo.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and system info are read at startup; logs and debug info are generated and optionally saved to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; use of system info and UUIDs is standard; no suspicious network activity or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions for logging and CLI output formatting, including debug, info, warning, and error messages. It captures system info and environment variables, manages debug logs in memory, and optionally saves logs to disk. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present, such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors. Use of environment variables for log levels and dump control is typical. The code's primary functions are benign and focus on debugging and user messaging.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility module for logging and output formatting with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe for use and does not contain malware or obfuscation.",
