  "anomalies": [
    "Use of os.environ.get() for log level control is standard, not suspicious",
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets",
    "UUID generated and used solely for filename uniqueness, no hidden or malicious intent",
    "No network connections or data exfiltration activities observed",
    "No obfuscated or dynamically executed code detected",
    "All code appears standard and straightforward for logging/debug purposes"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code provides logging and debugging utilities typical for CLI applications, with no indication of malicious behavior. It reads environment variables for log level settings, generates timestamped log filenames with UUIDs, writes logs to files and console, and conditionally outputs debug info. There are no network communications, credential handling, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code uses standard libraries and practices, with no suspicious constructs or behavior. Overall, it appears safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The source code is a standard logging utility module with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It securely handles logs, timestamps, and debug information, adhering to common best practices. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
