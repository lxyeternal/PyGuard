  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- The code reads version components from static files, reads a markdown file for the long description, and sets up dependencies and entry points.\n- No report indicates any suspicious behavior, dynamic code execution, or external untrusted input influencing runtime behavior.\n- The code does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code?**  \n  No. The code appears correct and typical for a Python package setup.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  None identified. The logic and structure are standard.\n\n- **Scores assigned by reports?**  \n  All reports assign:\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Obfuscated: 0\n  - Security risk: 0  \n  These seem appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Justification of risk scores:\n- Since the code performs only static file reads and configuration, the risk score of 0.5 or higher would be unjustified.\n- The malware score of 0 is consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscation score of 0 is correct; no obfuscated code is present.\n- Security risk score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or dangerous operations are evident.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- The only minor point is that the version is read from files, which could be manipulated if those files are tampered with, but this is a standard practice and not inherently malicious.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese reflect the benign, standard nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify this as a standard, safe setup script with no malicious or suspicious elements. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the absence of any indicators of compromise or malicious intent.",
