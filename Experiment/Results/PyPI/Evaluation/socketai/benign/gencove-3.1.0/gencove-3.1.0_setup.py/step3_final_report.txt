  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'gencove' CLI and API, configuring metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads version components from local files ('gencove/version/A-major', 'B-minor', 'C-patch') and long description from 'gencove/description/pypi_readme.md'.",
  "sinks": "Uses static data for package configuration; no untrusted input or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from files, then passes data to setuptools.setup() for package installation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; straightforward file reads and setup call.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static file reads for versioning and description, then calls setuptools.setup() with standard parameters. No dynamic execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The code structure is typical for Python packaging scripts. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The version files are static and within the package directory, which is standard practice. The dependency list is explicit and reasonable. Overall, the code is benign and aligns with best practices for package setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are accurate and justified.",
