  "purpose": "Package setup configuration for Gencove CLI tool, including versioning, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading version files (gencove/version/A-major, B-minor, C-patch), README file (gencove/description/pypi_readme.md).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks found; no code that executes or transmits data based on input.",
  "flows": "Read version files -> assemble version string; Read README -> provide long description; install dependencies; define CLI entry points.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated segments, or suspicious dynamic execution. The code appears standard for a Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version components from static files and combines them to form a version string. It also reads a markdown file for the long description. The setup() call defines package metadata, dependencies, and CLI entry points. There is no code that processes untrusted input, executes arbitrary code, or transmits data. All files and dependencies seem standard for packaging purposes. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads local files for versioning and description, and sets up CLI entry points without executing untrusted code.",
