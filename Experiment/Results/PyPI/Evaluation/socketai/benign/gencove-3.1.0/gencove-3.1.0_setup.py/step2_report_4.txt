  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of Reports:**\n- All five reports agree that the code is a standard setup script for a Python package.\n- They note that the script reads version info from static files, reads a README for the long description, and sets up dependencies and entry points.\n- No suspicious, obfuscated, or malicious behavior is detected.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0, indicating no malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code presence of issues:** No, the code appears straightforward and typical for a setup script.\n- **Malicious code, obfuscation, or secret handling:** None detected.\n- **Use of untrusted data in sensitive operations:** No, only static files are read, with no user input or external data influencing behavior.\n- **Flow of data:** Reads are from local files, and data is used in package configuration—no dangerous flow.\n- **Dependencies:** All seem relevant and legitimate for a CLI packaging setup.\n\n### Logical flaws or anomalies:\n- No anomalies, suspicious code, or logic errors are observed.\n- The version is constructed from files, which is common practice.\n- No signs of obfuscation or code hiding.\n\n### Scores and Justification:\n- **Malware score:** Remains at 0, consistent across all reports. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors.\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- All reports are aligned and accurate.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The code is safe, standard, and free of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final System Assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** 0  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Estimated security risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign setup script for a Python package. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security issues is present. The provided scores are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always monitor for future updates or external dependencies that could change the security profile, but based on the current analysis, this package setup code is safe.",
