  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging the Gencove CLI and API tool, managing versioning, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads version components from files, reads long description from a markdown file, and includes static dependency lists.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data or inputs are used in a way that could lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; the script only reads static files and sets package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual behavior detected. The code only performs standard setup operations.",
  "analysis": "The script reads version info from files, loads a markdown file for the description, and configures package metadata and dependencies. There are no dynamic evaluations, network operations, or credential handling. The dependencies appear standard and are explicitly specified. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup configuration for packaging a Python project, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
