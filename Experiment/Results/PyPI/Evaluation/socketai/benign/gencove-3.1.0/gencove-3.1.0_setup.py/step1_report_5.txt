  "purpose": "Packaging configuration for the Gencove CLI Python package.",
  "sources": "File reads for version components and long description, package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used in a risky manner; no network or system command executions present.",
  "flows": "Reading version files and description files, then passing static or controlled data into setup().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual code behavior; no obfuscation or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads version information and a README file from the filesystem, then uses setuptools to package a Python project. All inputs appear to be static files within the package directory, not influenced by external untrusted sources. No suspicious or malicious code, network activity, or potential backdoors are evident. No obfuscated code or code that dynamically executes or evaluates untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for packaging a Python project. It reads version numbers and description content from local files and configures the package metadata and dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code.",
