{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for CLI credential management, progress display, AWS session handling, user login, batching, and version checks within the Gencove CLI tool.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., GENCOVE_API_KEY, GENCOVE_EMAIL), user prompts via click, external libraries (boto3, progressbar), and internal function calls.",
  "sinks": "API calls for login, credential validation logic, environment variable access, and progress bar updates; no untrusted data flows leading to leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables or user prompts flows into credential validation and login functions; credentials are used for AWS session creation and API interactions; progress bars display transfer status based on file size.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Credential validation warns about multiple sources but does not perform malicious actions. Recursive OTP login is standard for 2FA.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of standard CLI utility functions handling credentials, AWS sessions, progress display, and user login flows. It uses environment variables and prompts appropriately, with no signs of malicious network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation. Credential validation issues warnings but does not leak data or perform harmful actions. The recursive OTP login is typical for 2FA. Overall, the code is clear, well-structured, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for CLI credential management, progress indication, and AWS session handling. No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present. The low risk score (~0.1-0.2) is appropriate, and malware score remains 0. The code poses no security threat.",
