  "purpose": "Utility functions for Gencove CLI, including credential management, progress bars, and AWS S3 interaction.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., GENCOVE_API_KEY, GENCOVE_EMAIL, GENCOVE_LOCALSTACK_S3_ENDPOINT), function parameters, and external libraries.",
  "sinks": "API client methods, environment variables, progress bar outputs, and AWS SDK calls.",
  "flows": "Credentials and configuration data flow from environment variables and user input into API client methods and AWS SDK interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials; no unusual code patterns. Use of recursive login for OTP, which is standard for 2FA flows. Progress bar and AWS client functions are typical. Batch processing and enum conversion are standard. No code appears to perform any malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises utility functions for authentication, progress indication, AWS credential refreshing, batch processing, and version checks. Credential validation warns about multiple credentials but does not leak or misuse data. AWS credentials are dynamically refreshed using provided methods, not hardcoded or suspicious. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or hidden network activity detected. Functions operate on trusted inputs and environment variables, with no signs of malicious behavior or data exfiltration. The overall structure and external calls are typical for CLI utilities interacting with cloud services.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be standard utility code for a CLI application, with no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It handles credentials, progress indication, and cloud interactions securely and transparently. No security risks or anomalies were detected.",
