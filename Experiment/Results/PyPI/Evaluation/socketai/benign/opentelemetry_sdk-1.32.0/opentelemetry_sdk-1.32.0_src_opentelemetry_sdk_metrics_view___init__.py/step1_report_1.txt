{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports specific classes and functions related to metrics aggregation and views from the OpenTelemetry SDK for metrics.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal OpenTelemetry modules, likely used internally within the library or by downstream consumers.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no network or file operations are performed.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to class and function definitions, with no external or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are detected. The code consists of import statements and an explicit __all__ export list.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing classes from internal modules and exporting them via __all__. There are no input sources, no data processing, no sinks, and no dynamic or unsafe code. The license header is standard for open-source projects. The code appears to be a typical module setup for a library package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module defining exports for OpenTelemetry SDK components. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security concerns. The code is standard, well-structured, and safe.",
