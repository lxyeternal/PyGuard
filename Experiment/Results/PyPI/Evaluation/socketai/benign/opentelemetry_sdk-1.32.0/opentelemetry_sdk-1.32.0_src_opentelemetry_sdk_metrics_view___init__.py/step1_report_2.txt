{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports various classes related to metrics aggregation and view configurations within the OpenTelemetry SDK.",
  "sources": "The code imports classes from the internal modules of the 'opentelemetry.sdk.metrics' package.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly involves class definitions and imports.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing classes and exporting them via __all__, with no data processing or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script consists solely of import statements and an __all__ export list, serving as a module for exposing specific classes. It includes license comments but no runtime logic, user input handling, or external network interactions. The code appears standard for a library's public API module, with no signs of malicious intent, data leaks, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module defining public exports for the OpenTelemetry metrics SDK. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears safe and legitimate.",
