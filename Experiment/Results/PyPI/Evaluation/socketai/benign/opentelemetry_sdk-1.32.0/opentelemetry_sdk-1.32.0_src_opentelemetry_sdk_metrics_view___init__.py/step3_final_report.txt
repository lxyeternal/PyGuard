{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that re-exports specific internal classes and functions from the OpenTelemetry SDK for metrics aggregation and views, facilitating their public API exposure.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported internal modules (_internal.aggregation and _internal.view).",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data or perform external communication.",
  "flows": "The source is the imported classes; the flow is limited to module import and export via __all__, with no runtime data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import/export module with license headers. No obfuscation, dynamic code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal SDK modules and an __all__ list defining public exports. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The internal modules are part of the SDK's internal implementation, which is standard practice. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are detected. The code's purpose is purely structural, facilitating API exposure. The absence of external data handling, network operations, or dynamic code indicates a very low security risk. The code's clarity and simplicity support a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module for exposing internal SDK classes, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
