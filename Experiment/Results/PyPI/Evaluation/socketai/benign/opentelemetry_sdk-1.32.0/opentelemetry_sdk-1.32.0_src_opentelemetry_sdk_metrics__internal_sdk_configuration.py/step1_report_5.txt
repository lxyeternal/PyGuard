  "purpose": "Define a data class for OpenTelemetry SDK configuration parameters",
  "sources": "Import statements from standard libraries and opentelemetry SDK modules",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; code does not process external inputs or outputs",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from external sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no unusual or malicious code structures",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party libraries related to OpenTelemetry SDK. It defines a data class with type annotations for configuration objects, referencing SDK components. There are no suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, hidden behavior, or data leaks. The code appears to be a standard configuration class with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for configuration purposes within the OpenTelemetry SDK, with no indications of malicious or suspicious behavior.",
