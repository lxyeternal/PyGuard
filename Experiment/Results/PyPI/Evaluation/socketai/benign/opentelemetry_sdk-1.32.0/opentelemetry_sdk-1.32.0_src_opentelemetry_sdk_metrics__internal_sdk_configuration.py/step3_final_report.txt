  "purpose": "Defines a configuration data class for OpenTelemetry SDK components, serving as a static configuration structure.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources; static import statements for SDK modules used solely for type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations; no external data handling or network activity.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static class attributes with type annotations only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and uses standard practices without obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static Python data class defining configuration parameters for the OpenTelemetry SDK. It imports only necessary modules for type annotations and contains no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. The class attributes reference SDK classes via string annotations, which is standard for avoiding import issues. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the benign and straightforward nature of the code. The confidence level is high (1), given the static analysis and lack of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, configuration-only purpose. No further action is necessary.",
