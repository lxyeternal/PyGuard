  "purpose": "Define a data class for OpenTelemetry SDK configuration, including filters, resources, metric readers, and views.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard library modules and OpenTelemetry SDK submodules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit untrusted data input or output sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks is observable, as the code only declares imports and a data class.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The import of SDK modules is standard and necessary for the package's functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward definition of a data class with type annotations referencing OpenTelemetry SDK classes. No code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns are present. The import statements are standard and serve to enable SDK configuration, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal part of a library or package setup for OpenTelemetry instrumentation. It does not contain malware or security risks and functions solely as a configuration data structure.",
