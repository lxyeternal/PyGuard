  "purpose": "Define a data class for configuring the OpenTelemetry SDK with various components.",
  "sources": "No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data transmission points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares a data class.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string annotations referencing possibly external classes; no actual instantiation or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules and defines a data class 'SdkConfiguration' with annotated attributes. It includes standard licensing comments and disables some linter warnings. There are no inputs, data processing, or outputs. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The code is purely structural and declarative, setting up configuration data structures for use elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign configuration data class with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply models configuration parameters for the OpenTelemetry SDK without performing any actions or data processing.",
