{
  "purpose": "Define a data class for configuring OpenTelemetry SDK components such as metrics, resources, and views.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reads; imports are static and from well-known libraries.",
  "sinks": "No sink points for untrusted data; no data output or network communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines a data structure.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and opentelemetry SDK modules. It defines a data class 'SdkConfiguration' with annotated fields referencing SDK classes. All imports are static, from open-source, and there is no dynamic code execution, user input handling, or external data fetching. The code appears to be purely declarative and intended for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign data class definition used for configuring OpenTelemetry SDK components. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present.",
