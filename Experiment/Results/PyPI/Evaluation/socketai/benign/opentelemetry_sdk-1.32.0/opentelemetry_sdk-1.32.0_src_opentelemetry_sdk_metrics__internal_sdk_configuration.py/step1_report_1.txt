{
  "purpose": "Define a data class for OpenTelemetry SDK configuration parameters.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources; static code imports and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs that handle untrusted data; only class attribute annotations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Python module defining a dataclass with type annotations referencing OpenTelemetry SDK components. It includes licensing comments, imports, and a class definition. No input handling, network operations, or data processing are present that could be exploited. The import of SDK modules appears necessary for type annotations and is not suspicious. The code serves as a configuration structure and does not execute any runtime logic that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, well-structured data class definition for configuration purposes related to OpenTelemetry SDK. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
