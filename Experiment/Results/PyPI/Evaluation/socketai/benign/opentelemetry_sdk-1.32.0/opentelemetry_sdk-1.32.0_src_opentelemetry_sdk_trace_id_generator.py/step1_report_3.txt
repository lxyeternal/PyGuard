  "purpose": "Provides a default implementation for generating span and trace IDs in a tracing system, using randomness.",
  "sources": "Calls to random.getrandbits() for generating IDs; potentially trace.INVALID_TRACE_ID and trace.INVALID_SPAN_ID for validation.",
  "sinks": "Generated IDs are returned for use in tracing; no direct sink involving untrusted input or external systems.",
  "flows": "The functions generate random bits, check for invalid IDs, and return the IDs; no external data flow or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of random.getrandbits() is standard for ID generation; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class for ID generation, with a default implementation that uses Python's random module to generate 64-bit and 128-bit IDs. The generate_span_id method ensures the ID is not equal to a predefined invalid span ID, and similarly for trace IDs. The use of randomness here aligns with typical ID generation practices in tracing systems. No external data sources, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The code appears to adhere to the specifications and does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for generating random trace and span IDs, following the OpenTelemetry specification. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are identified. It appears safe and intended for proper ID generation within tracing SDKs.",
