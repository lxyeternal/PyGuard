  "purpose": "Generate unique trace and span IDs for distributed tracing in OpenTelemetry, ensuring IDs are not invalid.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it generates IDs internally using Python's random.getrandbits().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or data leaks; no external sinks involved.",
  "flows": "ID generation flows from internal calls to random.getrandbits(), with validation against invalid constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward implementation with standard practices; no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an abstract base class for ID generation and a concrete class using non-cryptographic randomness. It validates generated IDs against known invalid constants, re-rolling if necessary. It adheres to OpenTelemetry specifications, uses standard modules, and avoids external data or network activity. No malicious, suspicious, or obfuscated code is present. The use of random.getrandbits() is appropriate for non-cryptographic IDs. The scores assigned by the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0.1, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the benign, standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation for generating tracing IDs, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low security risk score is justified given its purpose and implementation. Overall, it is compliant and non-malicious.",
