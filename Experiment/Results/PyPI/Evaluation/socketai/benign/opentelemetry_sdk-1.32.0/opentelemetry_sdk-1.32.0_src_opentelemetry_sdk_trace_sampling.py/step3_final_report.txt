{
  "purpose": "Defines sampling strategies for OpenTelemetry, including static and probabilistic samplers, configurable via environment variables and parent span context.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER, OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG), get_current_span() for parent span context.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data transmission or malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence sampler creation; sampling decisions depend on trace ID bits and parent span context.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard sampling logic for OpenTelemetry SDK, with clear, well-structured classes. It uses environment variables for configuration, which is typical. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscation are present. The logic for static, ratio-based, and parent-based sampling is straightforward and aligns with official SDK patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation of sampling strategies with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The use of environment variables for configuration is normal and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal.",
