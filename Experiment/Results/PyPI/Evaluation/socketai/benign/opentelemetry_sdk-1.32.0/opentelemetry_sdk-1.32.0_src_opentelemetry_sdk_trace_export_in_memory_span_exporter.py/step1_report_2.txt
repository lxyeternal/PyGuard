{
  "purpose": "Implement an in-memory span exporter for testing OpenTelemetry tracing, allowing spans to be stored, retrieved, and cleared.",
  "sources": "The code reads data when exporting spans (export method), and when clearing or retrieving spans (clear and get_finished_spans methods).",
  "targets": "The primary target is the internal list of spans (_finished_spans). No external or untrusted data sinks are used.",
  "flows": "Spans are passed to the export method, which extends the internal list; get_finished_spans reads from this list; clear empties the list; shutdown sets a flag to prevent further exports.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are present. The class functions are straightforward and intended for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The class provides memory storage for spans with thread-safe methods to add, retrieve, and clear spans. The shutdown method prevents further exporting. No external data sources, no network activity, and no code that could be malicious are detected. The code appears clean, standard, and well-structured for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard in-memory span exporter intended for testing. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are evident. It operates solely in-memory without external dependencies or data leaks.",
