  "purpose": "Define a data structure for reporting measurements via the OpenTelemetry metrics API.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules: opentelemetry.context, opentelemetry.metrics, and opentelemetry.util.types.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data leads to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Data is stored in the Measurement dataclass, with no data flow to external sinks or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors detected. Comments are about documentation issues, not malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a data class for capturing measurement data, including type annotations and documentation. It imports external modules for context, instrumentation, and attribute types. No code execution, external data reading, or network communication is present. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data class definition for use with OpenTelemetry metrics, with no malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks detected.",
