  "purpose": "Defines a data class for reporting measurement data in the OpenTelemetry SDK",
  "sources": "Imports from 'opentelemetry.context', 'opentelemetry.metrics', and 'opentelemetry.util.types'; class attributes",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; the code does not process external input or perform network or file operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; data flows are internal attribute assignments within the class",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic. The class is a straightforward data container with comprehensive comments",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary classes and defines a frozen dataclass 'Measurement' for encapsulating metric data. It includes descriptive comments and a TODO note about documentation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, external data processing, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be part of a standard SDK implementation for metrics reporting.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious component of the OpenTelemetry SDK for metrics reporting. No security risks or malicious intent are evident. It functions solely as a data container with no external or network interactions.",
