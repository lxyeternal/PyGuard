{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports internal classes and functions related to OpenTelemetry metrics SDK, primarily for instrumentation and metrics collection.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal OpenTelemetry modules, which are standard library imports and do not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code fragment; it only exports classes and functions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks, as this is purely a module definition with no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs are present. The code primarily consists of import and export statements with clear, descriptive class names.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and exceptions from internal modules of the OpenTelemetry SDK, and then exposes these through the __all__ variable. There are no dynamic code executions, data processing, or network operations. The structure is typical for a library's public API definition, with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for the OpenTelemetry SDK's metrics components, with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It serves as an interface to internal classes and functions for metrics collection and instrumentation.",
