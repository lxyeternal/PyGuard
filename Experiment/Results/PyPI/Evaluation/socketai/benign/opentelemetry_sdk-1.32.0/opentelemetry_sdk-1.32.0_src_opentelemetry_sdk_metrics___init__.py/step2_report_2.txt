  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is just import statements and an `__all__` list, exposing internal SDK components.\n- **Security implications:** No data flow, no external communication, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, purely structural.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, standard import/export setup from internal modules.\n- **Security implications:** No data handling or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—importing internal modules and defining `__all__`.\n- **Security implications:** No dynamic code, no external data, no malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Standard module for exposing internal classes; no runtime logic.\n- **Security implications:** No data flow, no external communication.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above—import/export module.\n- **Security implications:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code Content:** All reports confirm that the code is a simple module that imports internal classes/functions and exposes them via `__all__`. There is no executable logic, no data processing, no network activity, and no dynamic code.\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward and not obfuscated; scores are 0.\n\n- **Risk Score:** Since there is no malicious behavior, no data leaks, and no suspicious patterns, the overall security risk is effectively zero.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a typical module setup for a library, exposing internal components for public use.\n- There are no signs of supply chain attack vectors, malicious code, or obfuscation.\n- The import statements are from trusted internal SDK modules, and the code does not handle untrusted input or external data.\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No changes are necessary.",
