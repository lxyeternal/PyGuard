{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports internal components of the OpenTelemetry SDK metrics package and exposes them via the __all__ list for public API use.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from internal module imports, which are static and predefined; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only exports classes and functions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code only defines an export list for internal components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign module setup that imports internal SDK components and exposes them via __all__. It contains no executable logic, data handling, network activity, or dynamic code. The import statements are from trusted internal modules, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe module for exposing internal SDK components. There is no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security concern detected.",
