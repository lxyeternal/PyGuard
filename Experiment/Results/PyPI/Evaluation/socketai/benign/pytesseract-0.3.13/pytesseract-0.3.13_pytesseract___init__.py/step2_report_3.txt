  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and any necessary adjustments.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code snippet is a straightforward set of import statements from a local module (`.pytesseract`) and a version string.\n- No data processing, dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted inputs is present.\n- The code appears to be part of a package exposing OCR functionalities via imports.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the code as benign import statements with no security risks.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0.1 (slightly above zero, but acceptable given the import context)  \n  - Obfuscated: 0  \n- **Justification:** The low security risk score is reasonable; the code is simple and safe.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Also correctly states the code is benign, with no external input or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (appropriate)  \n- **Justification:** Fully aligned with the code's nature.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Same as above; straightforward import statements with no security concerns.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0  \n- **Justification:** Consistent with the code.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Correctly notes that this is a re-export/import layer with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0  \n- **Justification:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Also correctly describes the code as a standard import setup with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - SecurityRisk: 0  \n- **Justification:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is accurate.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (e.g., 0.1) but justified given the minimal nature of the code and its benign intent.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security Risk:** 0 — minimal risk, just import statements.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a simple, benign set of import statements exposing OCR functionalities. The scores across reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis assessment confirms the code's low security concern level.",
