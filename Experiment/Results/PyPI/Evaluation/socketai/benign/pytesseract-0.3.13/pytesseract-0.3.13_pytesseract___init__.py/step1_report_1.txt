{
  "purpose": "The code is importing functions, classes, and constants from a module named 'pytesseract', likely to provide OCR (Optical Character Recognition) functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'pytesseract' module, importing specific functions and constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing functions and constants from the 'pytesseract' module; no data processing or flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The imports are straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely importing specific elements from the 'pytesseract' module. No external input handling, data processing, or execution of untrusted code occurs here. The presence of multiple import statements from the same module suggests an organized export structure but does not raise security concerns. The module's name indicates OCR functionality, which is typical and not suspicious. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are visible in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement block for a Python OCR library. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks. The overall security risk score is very low.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
