  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code consists solely of import statements from a local module named `.pytesseract`.\n   - It defines a version string `__version__ = '0.3.13'`.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The comment `# flake8: noqa: F401` disables a linter warning about unused imports, indicating these imports are intended for re-export or API surface purposes.\n\n2. **Security Implications:**\n   - The code is a straightforward import/export module for an OCR package.\n   - No external input handling, data processing, or execution of untrusted code occurs here.\n   - No network or file operations are present.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n3. **Analysis of Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), and the assessments are consistent.\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import interface, with no malicious behavior.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 in all reports, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Ranges from 0 to 0.1, reflecting minimal or no security concern—appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n5. **Potential Risks or Concerns:**\n   - Since the code only imports functions and constants, the primary concern would be whether the `pytesseract` module itself is malicious or compromised.\n   - However, based solely on this snippet, there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n   - The presence of multiple import statements from the same module is typical for API surface exposure and does not imply malicious intent.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is a standard module re-export pattern for an OCR package.\n   - No security issues, malware, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The current scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n**Based on the code and reports, I would assign the following scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk:** **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, the code appears safe and benign.**",
