{
  "purpose": "This code serves as an interface or re-export layer for the pytesseract OCR functionalities, exposing various functions and constants for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module '.pytesseract' and the static version string '__version__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code only imports symbols for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward import block with a disabling comment for linter warnings.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a local module, exposing OCR-related functions and constants, along with a static version string. No data processing, dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted inputs occurs. The code appears to be part of a package's public API surface. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are evident. The import statements and static version string are benign. The reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of zero for malware and obfuscation, and very low security risk scores, which are appropriate given the simplicity and static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard module import block for an OCR package, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
