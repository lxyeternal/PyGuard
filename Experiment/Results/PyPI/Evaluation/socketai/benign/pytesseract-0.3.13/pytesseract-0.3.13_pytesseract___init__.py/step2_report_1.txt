  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess the security implications.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe straightforward import statements from a local module named 'pytesseract'.\n- No data processing, external inputs, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The __version__ string is a static attribute indicating package versioning.\n- No network, file, or environment modifications are evident.\n- The code appears to be part of a standard package interface exposing OCR functionalities.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward import statements.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (mostly 0 or 0.1). Given the absence of any suspicious behavior, this seems appropriate.\n\n**Assessment of potential issues:**\n- No evidence suggests that the code imports or executes malicious code.\n- No external inputs or untrusted data are handled here.\n- The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or lead to security vulnerabilities.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The reported scores are reasonable and consistent with the code snippet.\n- Since the code is purely import statements, the overall security risk remains minimal.\n- No changes to the scores are necessary based on this analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, just because it's a package interface, not because of any security concern)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code snippet is a standard, benign module import block for an OCR package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and justified.",
