  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Review:**\n   - The code consists solely of import statements from a local module `.pytesseract`, along with a version string.\n   - There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution.\n   - The imports include classes, functions, and constants related to OCR functionalities, likely from the Tesseract OCR engine.\n\n2. **Security Implications:**\n   - The code is a straightforward import module, serving as an interface or re-export layer.\n   - No untrusted data is handled here, nor are there any sinks that could process external input.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n   - The `__version__` string is static and does not impact security.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - They correctly identify that this is a standard import setup for an OCR library.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 1.0), and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are reported.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** Since there is no malicious behavior, the malware score should be 0.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, so obfuscation score should be 0.\n   - **Risk Score:** Given the absence of any security concerns, the overall risk score should be very low, ideally 0 or close to it.\n\n5. **Potential Concerns or Assumptions:**\n   - The only possible concern could be if the `pytesseract` module itself is malicious or compromised. However, this is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n   - The code does not execute any untrusted input or perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores in the reports (mostly 0 or very low, malware = 0) are appropriate.\n- No adjustments needed based on this analysis.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a benign import statement block with no security issues.",
