  "purpose": "This code module imports functions and classes from the internal 'pytesseract' package, likely to provide OCR-related functionalities.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.pytesseract' module, which may read internal data or configurations when imported or used.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present; no external network or system modification points are evident.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static and do not execute code or process external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual import statements. The code is straightforward, importing standard functions/classes.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from an internal module, likely part of a larger package. No dynamic code execution, external network connections, or credential handling present. The __version__ variable indicates versioning info but does not impact security. No malware-like behaviors or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module import setup for a package related to OCR functionalities. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
