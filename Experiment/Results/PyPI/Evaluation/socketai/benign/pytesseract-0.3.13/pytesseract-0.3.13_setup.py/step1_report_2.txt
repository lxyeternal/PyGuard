  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving user input or untrusted sources; the setup() call executes with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for a setup script. No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "This is a basic setup script importing setuptools and calling setup() with default arguments. It contains no additional parameters, user inputs, or dynamic code execution. No malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are evident. The code adheres to standard package setup practices and is minimalistic.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a simple and standard package setup invocation with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
