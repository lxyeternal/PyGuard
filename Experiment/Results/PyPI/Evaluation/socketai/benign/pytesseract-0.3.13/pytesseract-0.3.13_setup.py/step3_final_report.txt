  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from setuptools import setup' and the call to setup() with no arguments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process external input or data.",
  "flows": "Import of setuptools module (source) leading to invocation of setup() (sink) without parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard minimal setup script for Python packaging, importing setuptools and calling setup() with no arguments. It contains no dynamic behavior, external data, or malicious payloads. The code is static, simple, and consistent with typical packaging practices. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate given the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified and consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
