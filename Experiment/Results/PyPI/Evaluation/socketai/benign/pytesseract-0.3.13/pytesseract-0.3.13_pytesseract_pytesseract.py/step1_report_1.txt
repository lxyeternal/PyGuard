{
  "purpose": "The script provides an interface to perform OCR operations using Tesseract, including image preprocessing, running Tesseract with various configurations, and output processing in multiple formats.",
  "sources": "Reads input image files from filesystem; uses environment variables (e.g., for Tesseract path); executes subprocess commands to run Tesseract OCR; reads Tesseract version and language list via subprocess; reads image data for OCR processing.",
  "sinks": "Executes subprocesses (potential command injection if inputs are untrusted); reads image files from filesystem; accesses environment variables; writes temporary files; returns OCR output data in various formats; closes file streams.",
  "flows": "Input image file path -> subprocess command execution (e.g., run_tesseract) -> OCR processing -> output reading (e.g., _read_output) -> output returned to caller.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of environment variables is standard; subprocess commands are constructed from function parameters, but inputs are controlled internally; no suspicious network activity or code obfuscation; no backdoors or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily wraps Tesseract OCR functionality with various utility functions for file handling, subprocess management, and output parsing. It uses environment variables and subprocess calls securely, with standard practices like context managers and error handling. No malicious code or backdoors are evident. It executes external processes based on controlled parameters, with no evidence of code injection or data exfiltration. The use of temporary files and cleanup routines are standard for this type of application. Overall, the script appears to be a legitimate, functional interface for OCR tasks, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure and standard implementation of an OCR interface using Tesseract, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage. It performs legitimate tasks such as image processing, subprocess management, and output parsing without involving any malicious or suspicious activities.",
