  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the context, and the provided assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code review:**\n\n- The code is a wrapper around Tesseract OCR, handling image preprocessing, subprocess execution, output parsing, and error management.\n- It interacts with external processes (Tesseract) via subprocess, manages temporary files, and parses various output formats.\n- It uses environment variables and external command calls in a controlled manner.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are evident.\n- The code appears to follow standard security practices for such an application.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Legitimate OCR interface.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity; subprocess calls are controlled; no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code is a typical OCR wrapper with no malicious signs.\n- **Conclusion:** **Valid**. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** OCR functions with image processing and subprocess management.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity; proper handling of temporary files and subprocesses.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is accurate. The code’s external process execution is standard and controlled.\n- **Conclusion:** **Valid**. No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** OCR on images, multiple formats.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; subprocess calls are standard; no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the code’s behavior. No malicious signs.\n- **Conclusion:** **Valid**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** OCR utility, multiple output formats.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code; subprocess calls are standard; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent with the code.\n- **Conclusion:** **Valid**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** OCR on images, multiple formats.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious or malicious activity; subprocesses are used appropriately.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.\n- **Assessment:** The review is thorough and accurate.\n- **Conclusion:** **Valid**.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code analysis. The code does not contain any malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated routines.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; the code is clear and readable.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0 (0.2), which is reasonable given the code’s external process execution, but no actual security risk is evident.\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — Clear, well-structured code.\n- **Risk:** **0.1 - 0.2** — Standard risk for external process calls, but no actual vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears to be a legitimate, well-implemented OCR wrapper with no malicious intent or behavior. The scores are reasonable and justified.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware score at **0**.  \n- Keep obfuscated at **0**.  \n- Slightly lower the security risk to **0.1** for external process execution, but overall, the code is safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n**Malware:** 0  \n**Obfuscated:** 0  \n**Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (rounded to 0.2 in reports)  \n\nThe supply chain security risk is minimal, with no malicious activity detected.",
