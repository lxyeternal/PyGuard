  "purpose": "A wrapper around Tesseract OCR for image processing, output parsing, and subprocess management.",
  "sources": "External Tesseract executable invoked via subprocess; image input provided by user; environment variables for configuration.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess command execution; temporary file creation and cleanup; output file reading.",
  "flows": "Image input -> prepare and save image -> construct subprocess command -> execute Tesseract process -> parse output files -> return results.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Proper error handling and cleanup routines are in place.",
  "analysis": "The code securely manages external process invocation, handles temporary files responsibly, and processes OCR outputs in various formats. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The subprocess commands are constructed from controlled parameters, and environment variables are used in a standard manner. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured OCR utility interfacing with Tesseract. It does not contain malicious payloads, sabotage, or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal and justified as low. The supply chain appears secure, and no malicious intent is evident.",
