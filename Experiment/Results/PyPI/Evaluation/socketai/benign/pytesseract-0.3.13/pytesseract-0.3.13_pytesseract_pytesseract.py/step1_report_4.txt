{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface to perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on images using Tesseract, including various output formats and configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads input image files from filesystem, environment variables (via 'environ'), and subprocess outputs for version and language listings.",
  "sinks": "Executes external Tesseract process, reads output files, and captures subprocess output, which could potentially leak data or execute malicious commands if inputs are manipulated.",
  "flows": "Input image files → subprocess commands (Tesseract) → OCR output files or strings → processed data structures or printed output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed. Uses standard subprocess management, no suspicious command injection. The code interfaces with external Tesseract process but does not perform dangerous operations itself.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured OCR wrapper for Tesseract, managing subprocesses, temporary files, and parsing outputs. It includes version checks and supports multiple output formats. No suspicious logic, hidden network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The subprocess calls are standard and controlled. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors identified. The code depends on external Tesseract binary and libraries, but does not include malicious payloads or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as an OCR utility with no apparent malicious intent. It securely manages subprocesses, temporary files, and output parsing. No indicators of supply chain attacks or malicious code are present.",
