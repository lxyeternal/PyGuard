{
  "purpose": "This module provides utility functions for converting between settlement periods, dates, and times in different time zones, primarily for energy market settlement calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters such as datetime objects, integers for settlement periods, and string identifiers for time zones.",
  "sinks": "The code primarily performs time zone conversions and date calculations. It does not write to external systems, network, or files, nor does it handle untrusted data beyond standard input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input datetime objects (local or UTC) are converted to settlement periods and dates via functions that involve time zone normalization, localizing, and arithmetic operations. These flows are straightforward, involving localize, add timedelta, and difference calculations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are present. The code uses standard libraries (datetime, pytz) and clear logic. Exception handling is limited to raising specific custom exceptions on unrecognized time zones or invalid settlement periods. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of time zone conversions and settlement period calculations. It correctly localizes naive datetime objects, handles daylight saving time transitions, and computes settlement periods based on half-hour intervals. It does not contain any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The logic appears legitimate for its intended purpose. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs time zone-aware calculations for settlement periods without any signs of malicious behavior. It uses standard, well-understood libraries and follows logical steps. No security risks or malware indications were identified.",
