{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for converting between settlement periods, dates, and time zones, primarily for handling time-based settlement calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, such as datetime objects, dates, and strings representing time zones.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include conversions to timezone-aware datetime objects and returning settlement period info, but no data is sent over networks or written to files.",
  "flows": "Input data (datetimes, dates, strings) flows through conversion functions, with calculations adjusting for time zones and daylight saving, resulting in settlement period data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are detected. The code uses standard libraries and practices for timezone handling. Exception handling is straightforward, focused on invalid time zone or input issues.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of timezone-aware datetime conversion utilities related to settlement periods. It uses 'pytz' for timezone conversions, handles daylight saving adjustments, and includes validation for settlement periods. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor code. Functions perform expected calculations related to settlement times with proper normalization. No obfuscated code features or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for settlement period calculations, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It employs standard timezone and date handling practices and includes validation for input parameters. The overall security risk is very low.",
