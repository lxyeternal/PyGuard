  "purpose": "Utility functions for file size calculation, hashing, format conversions (xlsx/xls to CSV, CSV to Parquet), BOM removal, and in-memory CSV byte generation.",
  "sources": "File input streams, in-memory buffers, external files (xlsx, xls, csv, parquet).",
  "sinks": "File outputs, in-memory byte streams, temporary files.",
  "flows": "Read from files or streams (xlsx/xls), process data via libraries, write to temporary or specified files, return file handles or bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard libraries (`openpyxl`, `xlrd`, `pandas`, `csv`, `hashlib`) for data processing. Functions perform typical file operations, with proper handling of temporary files and in-memory buffers. No network activity, no data exfiltration, no backdoors, and no obfuscation are present. The code's logic is straightforward, with no suspicious data flows or external calls beyond legitimate library usage. The security implications are minimal, primarily related to handling untrusted data, but no vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility module for file processing tasks. No signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or obfuscation are present. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are zero. The overall risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting standard operational considerations.",
