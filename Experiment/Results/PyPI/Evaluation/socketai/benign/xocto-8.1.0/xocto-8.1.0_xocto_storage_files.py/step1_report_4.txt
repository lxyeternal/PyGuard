{
  "purpose": "The module provides functions for file size calculation, file hashing, conversion of Excel files to CSV, CSV generation, BOM removal, and format conversion from CSV to Parquet.",
  "sources": "File handles for input files, paths for reading Excel files, and optional CSV file paths for output.",
  "sinks": "File writing operations for CSV and temporary files, and network-based conversion functions that produce binary data.",
  "flows": "Input files are read in convert_xlsx_to_csv and convert_xls_to_csv functions, processed, then written to temporary files or returned as in-memory byte streams. CSV data is then converted to Parquet bytes with convert_csv_to_parquet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious hardcoded secrets, or hidden code. Use of temporary files is standard, with no evident malicious activity. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. All third-party libraries used are common for the task (openpyxl, xlrd, pandas, csv, codecs).",
  "analysis": "The code mainly focuses on file handling, conversions, and hashing. Functions utilize standard libraries and well-known open-source packages. No external network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The functions for converting Excel to CSV and CSV to Parquet are straightforward and do not contain malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are evident. The code reads input files and produces output files or in-memory bytes without any indication of malicious intent. No anomalous or suspicious code patterns are present, and the code structure is typical of a data processing utility module.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard utility module for file processing, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs file size calculations, hashing, format conversions, and temporary file handling securely. No malicious or sabotage indicators are identified.",
