  "purpose": "Check if there are any pending Django migrations that haven't been applied yet.",
  "sources": "connections[DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS], loader.graph, loader.migrated_apps, loader.applied_migrations",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code reads migration states internally",
  "flows": "connections[DEFAULT_DB_ALIAS] -> MigrationLoader -> graph traversal to count unapplied migrations",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward migration check logic",
  "analysis": "The code correctly utilizes Django's migration loader and graph to count unapplied migrations. It iterates over migration nodes and plans to tally unexecuted migrations. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The logic is standard and safe for Django projects. The reports provided are empty with only 'error: Empty response', offering no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious activity. Given the lack of detailed findings, the code appears secure, and the reports do not indicate any issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe Django migration check with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The reports are empty and do not provide any evidence of security concerns. Therefore, the overall security risk is minimal, and no malware or obfuscation is present.",
