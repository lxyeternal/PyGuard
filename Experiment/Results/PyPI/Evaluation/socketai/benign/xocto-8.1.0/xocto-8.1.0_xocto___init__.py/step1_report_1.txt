{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'xocto' package installed in the environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version information from the installed package 'xocto' using importlib.metadata.version()",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive actions are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code flows from importing importlib.metadata to retrieving the version string of 'xocto' and assigning it to __version__",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "This code imports the 'importlib.metadata' module to access package metadata. It then retrieves the version of the 'xocto' package and assigns it to the __version__ variable. There are no external inputs, network operations, or other potentially malicious behaviors. The code is standard for package version retrieval and contains no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard pattern for accessing package version information and presents no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
