  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a minimal, straightforward pattern to retrieve package version information.\n- It uses standard Python library `importlib.metadata`.\n- There are no external inputs, network operations, or outputs.\n- No suspicious or malicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The purpose is purely informational, likely for version tracking or debugging.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports correctly identify that the code simply retrieves the version of the `xocto` package and assigns it to `__version__`. The code functions as intended without any errors or anomalies.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports suggest any malicious intent or behavior. The malware score of 0 across all reports is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree that the code is not obfuscated (`obfuscated: 0`), which is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Given the benign nature, a security risk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Potential flaws or reasoning errors:\n- **Logical flaws:** None identified. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Assumptions about vulnerabilities:** All reports correctly avoid assuming vulnerabilities where none exist.\n- **Scores:** The scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk) are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Justification of scores:\n- **Malware score (0):** No malicious activity or intent is present.\n- **Obfuscated score (0):** The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score (0):** No security risks are introduced by this code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe reports are accurate, and their conclusions are justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis is a standard, benign pattern for fetching package version information. No modifications to scores are necessary. The code poses no security risks or malicious behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Maintain malware, obfuscated, and risk scores at 0.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Note:** Always ensure that such code remains simple and free of hidden behaviors, but in this case, it is straightforward and safe.",
