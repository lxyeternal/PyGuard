  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, using `importlib.metadata.version()` to retrieve the version of the 'xocto' package and assign it to `__version__`. There are no anomalies, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The code is minimal and standard for package version retrieval.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly state that the code performs a benign, standard operation with no malicious or suspicious behavior. No errors or logical flaws are apparent.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**  \nAll reports assign:\n- `malware`: 0\n- `securityRisk`: 0\n- `obfuscated`: 0  \nThese seem appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature. No adjustments needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**  \nSince all reports agree that the code is benign, no reason exists to assign higher risk scores. The code does not handle untrusted input, does not perform network operations, nor contains any malicious logic.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is correct. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**  \nAll reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious intent. They recognize the code as a standard pattern for version retrieval.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**  \nScores are consistent with the analysis—no issues are overstated or understated.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Additional Comments:\nGiven the code's simplicity and the reports' accuracy, I agree with the current scoring. There is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. The code is a common pattern used in Python packages for version retrieval.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No changes necessary.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\nMaintain the current scores:\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Risk: 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis.",
