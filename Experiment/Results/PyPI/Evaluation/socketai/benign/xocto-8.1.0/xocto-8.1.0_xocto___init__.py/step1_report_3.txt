  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'xocto' package.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() function call to access package metadata.",
  "sinks": "The version string output, which is used internally or exported; no untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The package name 'xocto' is provided to the metadata.version() function, which retrieves its version; this data is stored in __version__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward, minimal, and uses standard library functions with no hidden or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'importlib.metadata' module and uses it to obtain the version of the 'xocto' package. This is a common pattern for version retrieval in Python packages. No input/output processing beyond internal function call, no hardcoded secrets or malicious code present. The code is concise and appears to be for informational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard and benign implementation for fetching package version information. No malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, or security risks are identified.",
