  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard library functions.\n- No suspicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or external inputs are involved.\n- All scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are zero, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The purpose across all reports is simply to retrieve package version info, with no indication of malicious intent.\n\n**Confirming code issues:**\n- The code does exactly what the reports describe: imports `importlib.metadata` and retrieves the version of 'xocto'. There are no issues or anomalies present.\n- No hidden malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious constructs are evident.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify the code as benign and standard.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n- The scores assigned (all zeros for malware and security risk) are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, correct given the code clarity.\n- Security risk is 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty.\n\n**Justification for any higher scores:**\n- Since there's no malicious behavior, no reason to assign higher malware or risk scores.\n- The code is non-obfuscated and safe.\n\n**Claims based on assumptions:**\n- All claims are based on straightforward analysis; no assumptions are made about hidden behaviors.\n\n**Consistency of scores:**\n- Scores are consistent with the code and analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Security risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a standard pattern for fetching package version information, with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not process untrusted data, does not perform network operations, and is not obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is benign, with no security concerns.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate.\n- No changes needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.",
