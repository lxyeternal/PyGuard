  "purpose": "Retrieve and store the version number of the 'xocto' package.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version function call to obtain package version information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code does not process or output untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "The code imports metadata and assigns the package version to __version__, with no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard library functions; no anomalies or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a standard library module, fetches the version of a specified package, and assigns it to a variable. There are no indications of data leakage, malicious behavior, or obfuscated code. The functionality is typical for package metadata retrieval. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign code intended to obtain the version of a Python package. It poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
