{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the installed 'xocto' package.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version('xocto') - reads the version information from installed package metadata.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that handle untrusted data or perform actions based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only reads package metadata and assigns it to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'importlib.metadata' module and retrieves the version of the 'xocto' package, storing it in the '__version__' variable. This is a standard practice for package versioning and does not involve any untrusted input or malicious behavior. There are no obfuscated elements or suspicious code structures. The code is minimal and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply fetches the version of a specific package without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical pattern used in Python packages for version tracking.",
