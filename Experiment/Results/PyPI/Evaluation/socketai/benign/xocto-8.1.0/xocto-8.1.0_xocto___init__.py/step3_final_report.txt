  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the installed 'xocto' package for informational purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package version using importlib.metadata.version('xocto').",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The source is the importlib.metadata.version() call; no data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard library functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports importlib.metadata and retrieves the version of 'xocto', assigning it to __version__. It involves no external inputs, outputs, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard pattern for fetching package version information, with no signs of malicious activity or security concerns. The provided reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
