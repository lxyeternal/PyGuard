{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for numerical operations, including rounding, truncation, clipping, and generating random integers, likely for mathematical or data processing purposes.",
  "sources": "Input sources include function parameters such as 'number', 'value', 'places', 'length', 'val', 'minval', 'maxval', and imported modules like 'random', 'decimal', and 'typing'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are functions that output data, especially 'random_int' generating random numbers and 'clip_to_range' returning values that could influence program flow; however, there are no external data leaks or network transmissions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through various numerical operations and assertions; notably, 'random_int' generates random numbers within a specified range, but no external data or network is involved.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code strictly performs numerical computations and random number generation without any covert or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a set of numerical utility functions without external or untrusted input sources that could be exploited for malicious purposes. The 'random' module usage is confined to pseudo-random number generation with explicit length validation. No obfuscated code, network activity, or system modifications are present. The assertions and input constraints help prevent misuse. Overall, the code's functionality is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of numerical utility functions with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It appears safe and straightforward, focusing on mathematical operations and pseudo-random number generation. No security risks or malware indicators are detected.",
