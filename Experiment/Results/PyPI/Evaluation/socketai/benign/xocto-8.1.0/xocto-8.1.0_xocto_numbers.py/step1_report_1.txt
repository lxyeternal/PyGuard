{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for numerical operations such as quantization, rounding, truncation, clipping, and generating random integers, mainly for data processing and mathematical computations.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include the function parameters: number, value, places, rounding method, and length for random number generation.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed within functions and returned; no external sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access are present.",
  "flows": "Inputs from parameters are processed through mathematical operations, decimal conversions, and assertions, with no external data flow or system interaction outside standard library functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code relies solely on standard library modules (decimal, random, typing) without any suspicious or obfuscated constructs. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns detected. The random_int function uses Python's 'random' module, which is predictable but common; no insecure random sources are used.",
  "analysis": "The functions implement mathematical and data processing operations with proper input validation and assertions. No external data sources, no network calls, or environment variable accesses are present. The use of 'random.randint' is standard for pseudo-random number generation; no cryptographically secure random functions are used, but this is typical for general purpose randomness. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are identified. The code appears to be straightforward utility functions intended for numerical processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of standard utility functions for numerical operations with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. There are no backdoors, data leaks, or suspicious external communications. The use of the 'random' module for pseudo-random number generation is typical and not inherently malicious. Overall, the code is safe and not malicious.",
