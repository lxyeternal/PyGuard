{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for numerical operations, range clipping, and random integer generation, likely used for data processing or calculations within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters such as `number`, `value`, `minval`, `maxval`, and `length` in `random_int`.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from functions; no external system interactions or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Inputs are processed within each function to produce output; no external or untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; functions perform standard mathematical and data validation tasks. The `random_int` function uses Python's `random.randint` without any seeding or external input influencing it, which is standard but does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple utility functions: `quantise`, `truncate_decimal_places`, `round_decimal_places`, and `round_to_integer` handle various rounding operations; `clip_to_range` constrains a value within specified bounds; `remove_exponent` normalizes decimal representations; `random_int` generates pseudo-random integers of specified length. All functions use standard Python libraries and idioms, with input validation and assertions to prevent misuse. No hardcoded secrets, network connections, or hidden backdoors are present. The code does not perform any system modifications, data exfiltration, or malicious activities. The use of `random.randint` is standard for pseudo-random number generation but does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of standard utility functions with no malicious behavior or security risks. There are no indicators of supply chain sabotage, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The overall security risk is very low, and the code is straightforward and safe.",
