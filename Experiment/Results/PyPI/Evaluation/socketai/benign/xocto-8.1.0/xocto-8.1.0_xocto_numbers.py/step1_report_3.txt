{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for numerical calculations, rounding, clipping, and generating random integers, likely for mathematical or data processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters: 'number', 'value', 'places', 'length', 'val', 'minval', 'maxval'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include 'random.randint' for generating random integers and 'decimal.Decimal' operations that handle numeric data, but no untrusted data is directly used in security-critical operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into mathematical operations and assertions; 'random_int' generates random data based on length; no external or untrusted data sources interact with system commands or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. Functions are straightforward, primarily performing numeric manipulations. No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions that perform mathematical rounding, truncation, clipping, and random number generation. No external input influences system commands or sensitive data; assertions ensure valid ranges. Usage of 'random.randint' is controlled by a function parameter and does not involve external data. No data leakage, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are apparent. The code does not interact with network, filesystem, or environment variables maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for numeric processing with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs straightforward calculations and random number generation without external threats or malicious behaviors.",
