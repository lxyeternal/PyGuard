  "purpose": "Numerical utility functions for rounding, clipping, and random number generation in Python.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (numbers, decimal.Decimal, length), standard library functions (decimal, random).",
  "sinks": "Return statements, no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters processed through mathematical operations, returning results without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; use of 'random' is standard for non-cryptographic purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises straightforward utility functions performing rounding, truncation, clipping, and pseudo-random number generation. All functions use standard Python libraries with no external data sources, network calls, or obfuscation. The use of 'random.randint' is predictable but typical for such utilities. No malicious logic, backdoors, or external data leaks are present. The functions include input validation and assertions, indicating careful design. The scores assigned in the provided reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard, benign utility functions with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The current scores are appropriate and justified, with a very low security risk score reflecting the minimal threat posed by pseudo-random number generation in this context.",
