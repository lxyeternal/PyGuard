  "purpose": "This code manages Pact contract testing setup, including configuration, service interaction, and obtaining git revision info for versioning.",
  "sources": "os.environ (environment variables), subprocess.check_output (git commands), requests.post (HTTP request with optional authorization)",
  "sinks": "requests.post (sending data over network), subprocess.check_output (executing system commands to retrieve git info)",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables or function parameters flows into network requests or system commands; subprocess outputs feed into string decoding",
  "anomalies": "Use of verify=False in requests.post disables SSL verification, which is insecure; potential information leakage via subprocess outputs; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs configuration and communication with a Pact broker and provider, retrieves git commit hash and branch name via subprocess calls, and optionally uses environment variables. The SSL verification is disabled in HTTP requests, which is a security concern. The subprocess commands execute system git commands, which is typical but can be risky if untrusted input influences commands, though here commands are static. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network connections.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard for Pact contract testing and versioning management, with no signs of malicious behavior. The insecure SSL verification is a security risk but not malicious. No evidence of malware or sabotage in the code. Overall security risk is low, but the SSL verify=False usage should be reviewed.",
