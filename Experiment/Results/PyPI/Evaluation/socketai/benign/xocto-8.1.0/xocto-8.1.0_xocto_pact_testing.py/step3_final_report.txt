{
  "purpose": "Provides a Pact client setup, retrieves Git revision and branch info, and performs HTTP requests to Pact brokers.",
  "sources": "Subprocess calls executing 'git rev-parse' and 'git rev-parse --abbrev-ref', and requests.post calls with verify=False.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST requests to Pact broker endpoints, subprocess outputs used for version info.",
  "flows": "Subprocess outputs (git hash/branch) used for versioning; requests.post sends data to broker, with SSL verification disabled.",
  "anomalies": "Use of verify=False in requests disables SSL verification; subprocess calls are static and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard version info retrieval and Pact setup. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present. The main security concern is the disabled SSL verification, which exposes communication to MITM attacks but does not indicate malicious intent. Subprocess commands are static and safe in this context. No obfuscation or backdoors are detected. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, security risk~0.3) are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary security issue is the use of verify=False, which should be addressed for production security. The overall risk is moderate but not malicious.",
