  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for errors related to settlement periods, specifically for handling tz-aware datetime conversion issues.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reads present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the class is solely a custom exception definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward class definition with proper documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code introduces a custom exception class inheriting from Python's Exception base class, intended for use when handling tz-aware datetime conversion errors. It contains only a docstring explaining its purpose and no other logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs present. The simplicity and clarity indicate no malicious intent or security risks.",
