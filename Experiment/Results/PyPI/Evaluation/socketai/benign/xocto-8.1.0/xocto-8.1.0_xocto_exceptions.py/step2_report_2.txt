  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no data flows, input/output, or external interactions, confirming the code's simplicity.\n   - No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly state that the code is benign, straightforward, and free of malicious behavior.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n   - The summaries are repetitive but accurate given the code.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate because the code is a simple exception class with no malicious or obfuscated content.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since the code is purely a class definition with no external data handling, no security implications, and no malicious behavior, higher risk scores are unwarranted.\n   - The risk score should remain at 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n5. **Malware Score:**\n   - Confirmed as 0 across all reports, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions and stick to factual analysis.\n   - They correctly identify that the code is benign.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n- The code is a straightforward, well-documented custom exception class.\n- No vulnerabilities, malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The scores are appropriate and justified.\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is benign and should not be flagged for security concerns.",
