  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception inheriting from `Exception`. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows, and no complex logic or external interactions. The code is straightforward and does not contain any anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns.  \n**Conclusion**: No issues are present in the code.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their descriptions. They correctly state that the code is benign, standard, and free of malicious intent or security risks. No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \nAll reports assign a confidence of 1, with obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk scores all at 0. These seem appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \nSince all reports agree that the code is a straightforward exception class with no malicious or security concerns, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.0. Any higher score would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \nThe malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. The code does not perform any malicious actions, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \nAll reports are cautious and accurate, avoiding unwarranted assumptions. They recognize the code's simplicity and benign intent.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \nThe scores are consistent with the analysis, and no discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (correct)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (correct)\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the thorough reviews and the code's simplicity, I concur with the existing scores. The code is entirely benign and poses no security risk.\n\n**Final Recommendation**:  \n- Keep all scores at 0.  \n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is a standard, well-documented custom exception class with no malicious, obfuscated, or security concerns. The reports are accurate and consistent.",
