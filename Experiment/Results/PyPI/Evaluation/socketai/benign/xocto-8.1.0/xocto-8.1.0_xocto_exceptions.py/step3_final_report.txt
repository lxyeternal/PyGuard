  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for errors related to tz-aware datetime conversions.",
  "sources": "No data input/output, external calls, or data reading; the code solely defines a class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external interactions; the class is a simple exception definition.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows or logic beyond class declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a straightforward class with only a docstring.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with only a descriptive docstring. It contains no logic, data handling, or external interactions. The class serves as a specific error indicator for tz-aware datetime conversion issues. Given its simplicity, there are no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented custom exception class with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
