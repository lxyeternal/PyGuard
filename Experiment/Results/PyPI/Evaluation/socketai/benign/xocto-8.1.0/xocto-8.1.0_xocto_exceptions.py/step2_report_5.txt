  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception. There are no signs of data handling, external interactions, or complex logic. Therefore, no issues or vulnerabilities are present in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly note the absence of anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malicious intent. No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a confidence of 1, with obfuscated, malware, and securityRisk scores at 0. These are reasonable given the simplicity and benign nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports correctly assign a securityRisk of 0, and the code is a straightforward exception class, there's no justification for higher risk scores. The code does not pose any security threat.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is appropriate. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they accurately describe the code's purpose and behavior.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent and justified given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no security concerns. It serves its purpose without any suspicious or malicious elements.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code is straightforward, and the reports correctly identify it as such. No changes to the scores or analysis are necessary.",
