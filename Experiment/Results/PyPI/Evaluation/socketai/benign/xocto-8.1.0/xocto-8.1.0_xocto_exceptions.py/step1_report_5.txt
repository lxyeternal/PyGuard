  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for errors related to settlement periods, specifically when converting timezone-aware datetime objects.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code only defines an exception class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output.",
  "flows": "No data flow as the code only defines a class without execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class definition inheriting from Exception with a docstring explaining its purpose. There are no inputs, data processing, external calls, or suspicious constructs. It is a standard custom exception class implementation in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard exception class with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
