  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for parsing and modifying URLs, specifically for handling query parameters and file system destination URLs, often used in file upload workflows.",
  "sources": "Reads input URLs and query parameters from function arguments and URL parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "Returns modified URLs; manipulates path components for file upload destinations.",
  "flows": "Inputs (URLs, query parameters) are parsed; values like 'upload' and 'destination' are extracted; URL paths are modified based on these parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are detected. The code mainly manipulates URLs and paths with no network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation. No dynamic code execution or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries for URL parsing and path manipulations, with clear, documented logic for extracting and constructing URLs and paths. Functions handle URL query parameters safely, raising errors for multi-valued parameters where appropriate. Path calculations use os.path functions securely. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware, and the functions perform their intended URL and path manipulations without side effects. No obfuscated code, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign utility for URL parsing and manipulation related to file upload workflows. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided code. The overall security risk score is low.",
