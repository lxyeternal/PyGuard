{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for parsing and modifying URLs, specifically tailored for file system URLs with upload and destination handling, likely used in file transfer workflows.",
  "sources": "Input URLs provided as function arguments, read during parsing and URL manipulation.",
  "sinks": "No apparent data sinks where untrusted data is explicitly sent or stored; the code primarily manipulates URLs and paths without external data transmission.",
  "flows": "URL input -> parse and modify query parameters (pop_url_query_param) -> adjust URL paths and schemes (parse_file_destination_from_url, _fix_url_scheme).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials or backdoors; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution. The functions perform standard URL parsing and path operations. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or malware behavior. The use of os.path functions could theoretically be manipulated if inputs are malicious, but within the scope, no malicious intent detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is well-structured utility functions for URL manipulation with clear docstrings and no malicious operations. It handles query parameters and path resolution in a typical, safe manner. No suspicious network connections, system modifications, or obfuscated constructs are present. The functions only read and process URLs and paths, with no external communications or sensitive data handling. All operations are standard and do not suggest malicious intent or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a safe utility for URL parsing and manipulation, with no signs of malicious or maliciously sabotaging behavior. It is likely part of a larger, benign file transfer or URL handling system. No security risks or malware indicators identified.",
