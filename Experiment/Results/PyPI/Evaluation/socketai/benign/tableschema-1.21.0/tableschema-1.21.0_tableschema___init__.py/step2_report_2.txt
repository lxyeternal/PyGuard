  "review": "Let's analyze the provided code and the reports step-by-step.\n\n1. **Code Review & Presence of Issues**:\n   - The code appears to be a straightforward Python module that imports various components and exceptions, setting up a package API.\n   - There are no embedded malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code does not contain any dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling that could be malicious.\n   - The only notable aspect is the import of a `config` module for versioning, which is standard.\n\n2. **Assessment of the Reports**:\n   - All reports indicate `\"error\": \"Empty response\"` with no raw response provided.\n   - This suggests that the reports do not contain any detailed analysis, evidence, or specific findings related to the code.\n   - Without detailed content, it's impossible to identify vulnerabilities, malware, or flaws based solely on these reports.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports' Logic or Reasoning**:\n   - The reports lack substantive information; they do not provide any reasoning, evidence, or context.\n   - Labeling each report as \"Empty response\" indicates they are placeholders or incomplete.\n   - There is no basis to evaluate or challenge their conclusions, as they are effectively blank.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - Since no specific issues are described, assigning high scores (e.g., malware or risk > 0.5) would be unjustified.\n   - The absence of evidence suggests that the malware score should be 0.\n   - The risk score should also be low unless new information indicates otherwise.\n   - The obfuscated score remains 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n\n5. **Potential Misinterpretations or Assumptions**:\n   - Without additional context, assuming malicious intent or vulnerabilities from empty reports is unwarranted.\n   - The code itself is standard and does not exhibit any suspicious behavior.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - Given the lack of evidence, the scores should be:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated score: 0\n     - Risk score: 0\n\n**Summary & Final Recommendations**:\n- The code appears benign and well-structured.\n- The reports are empty and do not provide any evidence of issues.\n- Therefore, no changes to scores are necessary based on current information.\n- If further detailed reports or evidence are provided, re-evaluation would be warranted.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis conservative assessment aligns with the available data.",
