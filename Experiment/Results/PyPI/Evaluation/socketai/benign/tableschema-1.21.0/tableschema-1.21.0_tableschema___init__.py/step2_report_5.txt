  "review": "Let's analyze the situation step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   The provided code appears to be a straightforward Python module, primarily importing various components and defining a version. There are no apparent vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious behavior within this snippet. It is a typical module setup for an open-source package.\n\n2. **Analysis of the reports:**  \n   All five reports are marked as \"Empty response\" with no raw response data provided. This suggests that the reports do not contain any details about actual security issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious activity related to this package.\n\n3. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n   Since the reports are empty, there are no claims, reasoning, or summaries to evaluate. The lack of information prevents any assessment of potential issues.\n\n4. **Scores assigned to issues:**  \n   Without any details, the scores for malware, obfuscation, or risk cannot be meaningfully assigned. Any scores assigned without evidence would be speculative and unreasonable.\n\n5. **Potential for malicious activity or vulnerabilities:**  \n   Based on the code snippet, there is no indication of malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The code is standard and does not perform any suspicious operations.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   Since the reports are empty, there are no claims to challenge or validate.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   Given the absence of evidence, the scores should be minimal or zero across malware, obfuscation, and risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Code review:** No issues or malicious code detected.\n- **Report validity:** No information provided; thus, no issues to confirm or deny.\n- **Score adjustments:** Based on the available data, the scores should be **very low or zero** for malware, obfuscation, and risk.\n\n### Suggested scores:\n\n| Category          | Score (out of 1) | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0.0              | No malicious behavior or code present.                     |\n| Obfuscated        | 0.0              | Code appears straightforward, no obfuscation detected.   |\n| Risk              | 0.1              | Default minimal risk due to lack of information.          |\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\nGiven the lack of any concrete evidence or detailed reports, the safest conclusion is that there is no indication of a security incident in this package based on the provided data. All scores should reflect that minimal concern.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- No issues confirmed.  \n- Scores: Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0.0, Risk 0.1.",
