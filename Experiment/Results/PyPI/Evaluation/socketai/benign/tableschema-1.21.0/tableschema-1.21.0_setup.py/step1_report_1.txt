{
  "purpose": "The script sets up and configures a Python package named 'tableschema' for distribution, specifying dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading package version from a file ('VERSION'), reading README content from 'README.md', and importing setup-related functions and modules.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function, which registers package data, dependencies, and entry points, but does not execute untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Reading external files (VERSION and README.md) which are used to set package metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources into vulnerable sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and standard for Python packaging. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious behaviors are present. The use of __future__ imports is benign.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules for file handling and package setup. It defines a helper function 'read' to read files from the filesystem. It constructs package metadata including dependencies, version, and description. The setup() call uses these values to configure package distribution. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or suspicious patterns. All parts align with typical packaging practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no malicious intent or security risks. It reads package info from local files and configures the package appropriately without executing any untrusted code or performing suspicious actions.",
