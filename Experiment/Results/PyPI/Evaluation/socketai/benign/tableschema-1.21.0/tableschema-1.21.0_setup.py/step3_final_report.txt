  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads version info and README content from local files; static data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "Static data from local files into setup configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; code follows typical setup script patterns without suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, static configuration script for packaging a Python library. It reads local files for version and README, defines dependencies, and calls setup() with package metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not execute untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain hidden backdoors. All signals indicate a benign, standard package setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The provided reports correctly identify the code as safe, with appropriate scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
