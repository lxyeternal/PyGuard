  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard setup script.\n- Sources: Reads version and README from local files.\n- Sinks: No untrusted data execution or network activity.\n- Flows: Static data from files into setup.\n- Anomalies: None; straightforward, standard code.\n- Analysis: No suspicious behavior; all practices are typical.\n- Conclusion: No malicious intent or security risks.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources: Reads version and README.\n- Sinks: No data leaks or untrusted data execution.\n- Flows: Static configuration.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard boilerplate, no suspicious patterns.\n- Conclusion: Safe, benign script.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources: Reads version and README.\n- Sinks: No sensitive data leaks.\n- Flows: Static data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical setup script, no malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: No security risks.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Sources: Reads version and README.\n- Sinks: No untrusted data used maliciously.\n- Flows: Static configuration.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Standard setup practices.\n- Conclusion: Benign, safe.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same.\n- Sources: Reads version and README.\n- Sinks: No suspicious data handling.\n- Flows: Static data.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Analysis: Typical setup script.\n- Conclusion: No risks.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Obfuscated: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None detected. All reports confirm the code is straightforward, standard setup code.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, as no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since the script performs static configuration without any suspicious or dangerous operations.\n\n### Final notes:\n- The reports are consistent and thorough.\n- The code is typical for a Python package setup script.\n- No indicators of supply chain compromise or malicious activity are evident.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The package setup script is benign, with no security concerns.",
