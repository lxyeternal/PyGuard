  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** The script sets up a Python package, reading version info and README from local files.  \n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity; static file reads.  \n- **Anomalies:** None; standard setup script.  \n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard package setup.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Also describes standard setup procedures with no suspicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Continues the pattern of standard package configuration with no anomalies.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same conclusion: standard setup script, no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — **appropriate**.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence of malicious or obfuscated code:** None.  \n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated code:** None detected; scores are 0.  \n- **Risk score:** The code is purely static, standard package setup, so risk is negligible (0).\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The current scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no security concerns. All reports are accurate in their assessments.",
