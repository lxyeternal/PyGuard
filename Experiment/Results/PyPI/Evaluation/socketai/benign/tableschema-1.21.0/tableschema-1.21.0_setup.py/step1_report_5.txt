{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'tableschema' with specified dependencies and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads files for version and README content, and uses setuptools to gather package info and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is used in a context that could lead to security vulnerabilities or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The version and README content are read from files and passed into setup() without modification, then the setup configuration is executed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is a standard setup script with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports modules, reads static files (README.md and VERSION file), and calls setup() with predefined parameters. It does not execute any untrusted input, nor does it contain network operations, command execution, or other potentially malicious behaviors. The dependencies are standard and publicly available. No anomalies or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, benign package setup script for Python distribution. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided content.",
