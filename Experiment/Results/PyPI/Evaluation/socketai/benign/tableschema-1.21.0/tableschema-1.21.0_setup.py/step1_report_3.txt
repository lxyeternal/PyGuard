{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'tableschema', facilitating its installation and distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the file system, specifically reading the version file and README.md, and retrieves package files via find_packages().",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks exist where untrusted data is used to perform sensitive actions or data leaks. The setup configuration primarily handles package metadata.",
  "flows": "The data flows from file reads (version, README) into setup parameters; no untrusted input processing or data flows into critical security-sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors are present. Usage of standard setup routines and helper functions appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The script employs standard Python setup tools for packaging, including reading files for versioning and description. No code injection, dynamic execution, or obfuscated code is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All dependencies are listed plainly, with no suspicious references. The code is clean, straightforward, and typical for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a conventional package setup script with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. It solely manages package metadata and dependencies, adhering to best practices.",
