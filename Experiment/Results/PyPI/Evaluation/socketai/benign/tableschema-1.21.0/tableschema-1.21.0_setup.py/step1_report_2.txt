{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package called 'tableschema' for distribution, specifying dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading version information and README content from files, defining dependencies, and setting up package configuration.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks involved; the code does not send or receive data over the network, nor does it execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "N/A - the script performs static setup configuration without dynamic data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and functions for package setup. It reads package metadata from files using a helper function. Dependencies are listed explicitly, and setup parameters are straightforward, including package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. No code performs network operations, file manipulation beyond reading package files, or executes untrusted input. The code is standard boilerplate for Python package distribution with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is well-structured, performs static configuration, and does not contain obfuscated or harmful code.",
