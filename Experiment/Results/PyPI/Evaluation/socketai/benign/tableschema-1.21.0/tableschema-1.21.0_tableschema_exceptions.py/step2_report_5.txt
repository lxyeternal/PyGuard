  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports identify that the code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes, with standard inheritance, properties, and some deprecated aliases.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are involved.\n- No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The only minor technical note is the use of `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` in `DataPackageException.__init__`, which is a known pattern for Python 2 compatibility but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues in the code:\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code appears to be straightforward class definitions for exception handling, with no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The only potential technical oversight is the `super()` call, which is not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:\n\n- **Super() call:** The reports mention that `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` is correct but is a known pattern for Python 2. Since the code includes `from __future__ import` statements, it seems intended for Python 2/3 compatibility. This is not an error but could be clarified. It does not impact security or malware status.\n- **No other errors or flaws** are identified in the reports.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and their reasonableness:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign `0.0`, which is appropriate. No malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign `0.0`, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign `0.0`, which is reasonable given the benign nature.\n\nNo changes needed; the scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- **No reason to assign higher risk scores.** The code is purely structural, defining exception classes for error handling. There are no runtime behaviors, data processing, or external interactions that could pose security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Malware considerations:\n\n- **No malware present.** The code does not perform any malicious actions, nor does it contain obfuscated or suspicious code snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n\n- All claims are cautious and based on the actual code content. No unwarranted assumptions are made about hidden behaviors.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\n**This code is a benign, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of exception class definitions for error handling in a data validation or schema management context. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor technical note about the `super()` call is not a security issue. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk.\n\n**Final recommendation:** No changes needed; the code is safe and benign.",
