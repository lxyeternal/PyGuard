  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Correctly identifies that the code defines exception classes with no external data handling, no obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- **Assessment:** The code is benign, straightforward, and purely for error categorization.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, risk is 0. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues here.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, notes the proper class hierarchy, no external data flows, no suspicious patterns. Mentions the use of super() for Python 2 compatibility, which is correct.\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard exception class definitions, safe and benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, risk is 0. The reasoning aligns with the code.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—class definitions with no external data or malicious behavior. No anomalies or suspicious constructs.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with proper exception class structure.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, risk is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar analysis, no external data, no malicious patterns. Emphasizes the lack of obfuscation or suspicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The code is a typical exception hierarchy.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, risk is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Notes the same, with a minor technical oversight in the use of super() in the `DataPackageException.__init__` method, calling `super(Exception, self).__init__(message)` instead of `super().__init__(message)`. This is a known pattern for Python 2 compatibility but not malicious.\n- **Assessment:** The code remains benign; no external data handling or malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated are 0, risk is 0.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Content:** All reports agree that the code is purely class definitions for exception handling, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- **Malware Score:** Consistently 0 across all reports. No indication of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n- **Risk Score:** All are 0, justified by the lack of external data handling, no code execution, and no malicious intent.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard exception hierarchy, used internally for error reporting.\n- No external inputs, outputs, or network interactions.\n- No obfuscation, no malicious code, no backdoors.\n- The minor Python 2 compatibility pattern in the `super()` call is standard and not malicious.\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThis code is entirely benign and typical for a Python error handling module.",
