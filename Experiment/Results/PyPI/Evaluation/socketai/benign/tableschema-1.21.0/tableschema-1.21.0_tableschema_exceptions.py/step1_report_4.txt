{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various errors related to data packaging, table schema, loading, validation, casting, integrity, relation, and storage.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code defines classes and exception handling structure. The only data input is the 'message' and 'errors' parameters in the exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing that handles untrusted input; no code executes based on external input, nor does it process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows or dynamic data handling processes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs. The code uses standard Python class definitions and exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively consists of class definitions for exceptions with documentation and property methods. It does not perform any input/output, network communication, or data processing. The exception classes are straightforward, inherit properly, and use standard Python features. No code injections, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are observed. The code appears to serve as a structured error handling module for a larger data package library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of exception class definitions intended for error handling in data package schemas. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a benign, well-structured component of a larger system.",
