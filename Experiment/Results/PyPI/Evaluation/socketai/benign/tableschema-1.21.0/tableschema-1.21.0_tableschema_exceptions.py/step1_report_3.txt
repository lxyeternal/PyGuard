{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to data packaging and schema validation.",
  "sources": "No external data input; exceptions are used internally for error handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data output points; the code only raises and defines exceptions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; exception classes are standard Python class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of class definitions and inheritance, with no suspicious constructs or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a hierarchy of custom exceptions related to data packaging and schema validation, including properties for error details. The use of __errors for nested exceptions and the presence of deprecated aliases are standard practices. There are no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, nor any obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, benign set of class definitions for error handling in a data processing library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
