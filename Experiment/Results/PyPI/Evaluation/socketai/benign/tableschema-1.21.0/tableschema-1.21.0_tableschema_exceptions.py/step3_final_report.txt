{
  "purpose": "Defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for data packaging and schema validation errors, facilitating structured error handling and reporting.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class definitions are static and do not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no external communication or data output occurs within this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or output; the code solely establishes exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "Minor use of super() pattern for Python 2 compatibility in DataPackageException.__init__, but this is a standard pattern and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward class definitions for exception handling, with properties for nested errors and deprecated aliases. No external data handling, network activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The use of super() is compatible with Python 2 and 3 but does not impact security. The code is benign, serving purely as an error hierarchy. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception hierarchy with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor super() pattern is a compatibility feature and does not introduce vulnerabilities. All signals indicate a safe, well-structured error handling module.",
