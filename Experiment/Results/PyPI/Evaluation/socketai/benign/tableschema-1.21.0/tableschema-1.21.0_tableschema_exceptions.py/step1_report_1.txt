{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for data packaging, schema validation, and related errors in a Python module.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all data is internally handled via exception objects and class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to external systems or untrusted data outputs; exceptions are used for error handling only.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code primarily defines classes and does not process untrusted data or external input.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward class definitions for exception handling, with no unusual constructs or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of exception classes for handling various error conditions in a data packaging or schema validation context. It includes deprecated aliases, standard exception patterns, and properties for nested errors. There are no external data sources, sinks, or data flows that could be exploited. No obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exceptions used for error handling within a larger data processing system. It contains no malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks. The code appears benign and intended solely for structured error reporting.",
