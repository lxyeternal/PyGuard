  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for a data packaging and schema validation library.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception initializations, specifically the __init__ method in DataPackageException.",
  "sinks": "The super() call in DataPackageException.__init__, but it only calls the base Exception constructor with a message.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation flows, passing messages and error lists to exception objects, with no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns; the code consists solely of class definitions and simple property methods.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple exception classes for handling data package errors. The base class DataPackageException accepts a message and an optional list of nested errors, exposing them via properties. Derived classes categorize different error types, such as validation, casting, integrity, relation, and storage errors. There are no inputs from external sources, no data flows to external sinks, no network or file operations, and no obfuscated or suspicious code patterns. The use of super(Exception, self).__init__(message) appears correct, but is a known pattern for Python 2 compatibility. No malicious or harmful code, backdoors, or security issues are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured set of exception class definitions intended for a data validation library. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious activity, and no indication of security risks. It appears safe and solely serves error categorization.",
