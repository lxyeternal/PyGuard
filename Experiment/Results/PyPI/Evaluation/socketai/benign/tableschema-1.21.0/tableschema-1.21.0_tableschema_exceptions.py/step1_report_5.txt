{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to data packaging and table schema operations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code defines classes and their attributes/methods.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; primarily class definitions and exception handling structures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. The code follows standard Python exception class patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exception handling, including base and derived exception classes. There are no external inputs, no network operations, or dynamic code execution. The __init__ method in DataPackageException incorrectly calls super(Exception, self).__init__(message), which is a minor oversight but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward and intended for error handling within a larger data processing framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely structural and does not perform any runtime actions that could be malicious.",
