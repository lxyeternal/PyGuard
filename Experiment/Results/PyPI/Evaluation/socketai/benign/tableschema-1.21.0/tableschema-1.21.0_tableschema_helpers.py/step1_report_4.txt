  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for loading descriptors, expanding schemas, ensuring directories, normalizing values, and dynamically importing plugins.",
  "sources": "Reading from URLs (requests.get), reading from local files (io.open), and stream inputs (json.load).",
  "sinks": "Requests response json(), file operations, dynamic module specification in find_spec.",
  "flows": "Input source (URL/local/stream) -> retrieve_descriptor -> json.load or requests.get().json(). Followed by optional deep copies and schema expansions. PluginImporter transforms module names for dynamic importation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious data leaks, or backdoors observed. Use of sys.meta_path for plugin import is standard but could be misused if manipulated externally; however, in isolation, it appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary functions are to load descriptors from various sources, expand schema definitions, and handle dynamic plugin imports. The network request (requests.get) is used for remote source retrieval, which is typical for such tools. File operations are standard, and exception handling is basic. The plugin importer manipulates module names dynamically, which is legitimate for plugin systems but could be exploited if misused in a larger context. No obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads detected. The code appears well-structured for its intended purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with standard utility functions for data loading, schema handling, and plugin management. No evidence of malware or malicious activity. Slight caution regarding dynamic module loading, but within typical use cases, it does not pose security risks.",
