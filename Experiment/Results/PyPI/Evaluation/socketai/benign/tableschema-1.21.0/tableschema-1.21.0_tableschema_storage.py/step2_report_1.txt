  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose:** Defines an abstract interface for storage, with dynamic plugin loading via `import_module`.  \n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior; standard plugin pattern.  \n- **Anomalies:** Dynamic import based on user input could be risky but is common in plugin systems.  \n- **Score justification:** Malware score = 0; security risk = 0.2; confidence = 0.9.  \n- **Verdict:** No issues; the code is a safe interface.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose:** Similar abstract interface with plugin pattern.  \n- **Findings:** No malicious intent; standard pattern.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code or hardcoded secrets.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0; security risk = 0; confidence = 1.  \n- **Verdict:** Safe, well-structured interface.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose:** Same as above, defining an interface for storage backends.  \n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior; plugin pattern is controlled.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0; security risk = 0.2; confidence = 0.9.  \n- **Verdict:** No malicious issues; safe interface.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose:** Same interface pattern.  \n- **Findings:** Dynamic import based on user input ('name') could be exploited if input is untrusted.  \n- **Analysis:** The pattern is standard but warrants caution.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0; security risk = 0.5; confidence = 0.7.  \n- **Verdict:** The potential for exploitation exists if input is malicious. The risk score is appropriately set at 0.5, reflecting a moderate concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose:** Same interface, with potential data handling points.  \n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior; dynamic import is controlled.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0; security risk = 0.2; confidence = 0.9.  \n- **Verdict:** Safe, standard interface.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment\n\n- **Presence of Malware:** All reports agree that there is no malware or malicious code present in the interface definition. The dynamic import pattern is standard for plugin systems but can be exploited if input is untrusted. However, the code itself does not contain malicious logic.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected. The code is clear, well-documented, and straightforward.\n\n- **Security Risk:**  \n  - Most reports assign a low risk score (~0.2), indicating minimal concern.  \n  - Report 4 assigns a higher risk score (0.5) due to the potential exploitation of the dynamic import pattern if the 'name' parameter is maliciously controlled.\n\n- **Scores Justification:**  \n  - The overall malware score should remain at **0**; no malicious activity is present.  \n  - The obfuscated score remains **0**.  \n  - The security risk score should be **around 0.2 to 0.3** for controlled environments, but if there's concern about untrusted input leading to module import vulnerabilities, a higher score (0.5) is justified, as seen in report 4.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious code detected).  \n- **Obfuscated score:** **0**.  \n- **Risk score:** **0.2 to 0.5**, depending on context. Given the reports, a conservative estimate would be **0.3**, considering the potential for exploitation if input validation is not enforced.\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured interface for a plugin-based storage system. No malware or obfuscation is present. The main concern is the dynamic import pattern, which could be exploited if the 'name' parameter is untrusted, justifying a moderate security risk score.\n\n---\n\n**Final estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.3\n\nThis balanced assessment reflects the code's safety but acknowledges the potential risk inherent in dynamic module loading if not properly controlled.",
