  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines an abstract storage interface, with dynamic plugin loading via `import_module`. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — justified; no malware or malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — a low score, primarily due to the dynamic import pattern, which could be risky if plugin names are manipulated.\n- **Assessment:** The report's reasoning aligns with the code. The dynamic import is a standard plugin pattern, and no malicious activity is evident.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change needed; the scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — consistent with the lack of malicious indicators.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as a safe interface.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change; scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a standard interface with controlled dynamic import, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — similar to previous reports, acknowledging the dynamic import pattern.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate; no malware or obfuscation, only the potential risk from dynamic import.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the potential security concern with dynamic import based on user input (`name` parameter). Recognizes this as a possible vector for exploitation if input isn't sanitized.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — because no malware is present, just a potential risk.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.5 — higher, reflecting the potential for exploitation if input validation is lacking.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The dynamic import pattern is standard but warrants caution. The score reflects the risk appropriately.\n\n**Recommendation:** The risk score of 0.5 is reasonable given the potential for exploitation if the input is untrusted. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with no malicious behavior, only the dynamic import pattern.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2 — consistent with other reports.\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies the pattern as generally safe if input is controlled.\n\n**Recommendation:** No change.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate; no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0; code clarity is evident.\n- **Security risk:** Most are low (0.2), except Report 4, which is 0.5 due to the dynamic import based on user input.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- The code is a standard plugin interface, with no malware or obfuscation.\n- The main concern is the dynamic import pattern, which could be exploited if input is untrusted.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0.5   |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0.2   |\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and justified. The only caveat is the dynamic import pattern, which is a common plugin approach but should be used with input validation to prevent potential exploitation.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent has been found. The main security consideration is ensuring that the `name` parameter in `Storage.connect()` is sanitized if it comes from untrusted sources.",
