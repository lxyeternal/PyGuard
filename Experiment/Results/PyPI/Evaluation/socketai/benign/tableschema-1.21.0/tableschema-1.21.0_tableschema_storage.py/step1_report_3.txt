  "purpose": "Define an abstract interface for storage backends in the tableschema library, allowing for pluggable implementations such as SQL storage.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`__future__`, `six`, `import_module`, `abc`, and local `exceptions`), class method `connect`, and abstract method definitions (e.g., `__init__`, `buckets`, `create`, `delete`, `describe`, `iter`, `read`, `write`).",
  "sinks": "The `connect` method dynamically imports modules based on a storage name, which could potentially be manipulated if the input is untrusted. However, it uses a fixed namespace pattern (`tableschema.plugins.%s`) which limits arbitrary module import. Abstract methods do not contain implementation, so no direct data processing occurs here.",
  "flows": "The flow involves calling `Storage.connect()` with a storage name, leading to importing a module from `tableschema.plugins.<name>`, then invoking the constructor of that module’s `Storage`. Other methods are abstract and would be implemented elsewhere, so their data flows depend on concrete implementations.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard Python features and a plugin system for modular backend implementations. No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or hidden behavior are present. The dynamic import pattern is predictable and controlled by the provided storage name.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an interface with no implementation logic, only abstract methods. The `connect` class method imports modules based on a namespace pattern, which is a typical plugin pattern and not inherently malicious. There are no suspicious code snippets, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms within this interface. The use of `import_module` is controlled and predictable, reducing the risk of malicious import manipulation. Since this is an interface, it relies on concrete implementations for actual data handling, so no malicious activity can be inferred from these abstract definitions alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a safe, standard interface definition for storage backends within a plugin system. There are no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The dynamic import pattern is controlled and typical for plugin architectures. Overall, the code appears secure, with no evident malware or security risks.",
