  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines an abstract storage interface with dynamic plugin loading via `import_module`. No malicious behavior is evident; the dynamic import is standard for plugin systems.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, considering the dynamic import pattern could pose a risk if plugin names are manipulated, but this is a common pattern.\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. No issues with the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious activity; the code is a standard interface.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** 0 — no significant security concern.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above; interface with no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Note:** Slightly higher risk score (0.2) is justified as a precaution due to the dynamic import pattern, but no actual vulnerabilities.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Identifies the main concern: dynamic import based on user input (`name` parameter). If untrusted input is provided, it could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.5.\n- **Justification:** The report correctly flags the dynamic import as a potential security risk, especially if the input isn't validated.\n\n**Assessment:** The higher risk score (0.5) is justified given the potential for exploitation if the `name` parameter is untrusted. The malware score remains 0, as no malicious code is present in the interface itself.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, emphasizing the potential risk of dynamic import if input isn't controlled.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2.\n- **Justification:** Slightly lower risk score compared to Report 4, possibly reflecting a more conservative view.\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable, but given the potential for exploitation, a risk score of 0.2 is acceptable if input validation is enforced.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusions:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all, as code is clear.\n- **Risk scores:** Vary from 0.2 to 0.5, with the higher value in Report 4 justified by the potential for exploitation via dynamic import.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The dynamic import pattern is a common plugin architecture but warrants input validation to prevent security issues.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The scores reflect a balanced understanding of the potential risks.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — the only concern is the dynamic import pattern, which should be validated, but in the context of a plugin system, this is standard.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and justified. The main point of caution is ensuring that the `name` parameter in `connect()` is validated to prevent potential code injection.",
