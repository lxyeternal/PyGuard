{
  "purpose": "Defines an abstract interface for storage backends with dynamic plugin loading via import_module, enabling flexible storage implementations.",
  "sources": "The import_module call in the connect() class method, which loads storage plugins based on the 'name' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The import_module function, which could potentially load malicious modules if 'name' is untrusted, leading to code execution.",
  "flows": "The 'connect' method receives 'name', constructs a module path, and imports the module dynamically; if 'name' is malicious, arbitrary code could be executed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import based on user-controlled input without explicit validation; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a standard plugin architecture for storage backends, with an abstract interface. The dynamic import pattern is common but can be risky if 'name' is untrusted. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The main concern is potential exploitation if input validation is not enforced on 'name'. The code itself is clean and well-documented, with no suspicious behaviors beyond the import pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured storage interface with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is ensuring that the 'name' parameter in 'connect()' is validated to prevent arbitrary module loading. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.5, reflecting the potential risk if input validation is lacking.",
