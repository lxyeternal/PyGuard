{
  "purpose": "The code defines an abstract interface for a storage system, allowing implementation of various backend storage types (e.g., SQL). It provides methods for connecting, creating, deleting, describing, reading, and writing data buckets.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not present; the code does not read external data or user input directly.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data; the code does not write data or communicate externally.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code primarily sets up an interface with method definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a standard interface with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The import of potentially insecure modules (e.g., import_module) is controlled within the class. No obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements an abstract class with placeholder methods meant to be overridden by concrete implementations. It uses dynamic importing to load storage plugins, which is a standard pattern for plugin systems. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or backdoors. The structure and content are consistent with a typical plugin interface, and no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code features are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as an interface for storage backends with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, well-structured plugin system interface. No malware or security threats are detected.",
