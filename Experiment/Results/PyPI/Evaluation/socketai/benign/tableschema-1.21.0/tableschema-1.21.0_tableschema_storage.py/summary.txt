  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured storage interface with no embedded malware or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is ensuring that the 'name' parameter in 'connect()' is validated to prevent arbitrary module loading. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.5, reflecting the potential risk if input validation is lacking."
