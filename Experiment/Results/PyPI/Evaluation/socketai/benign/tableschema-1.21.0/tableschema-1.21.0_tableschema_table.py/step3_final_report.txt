  "purpose": "A class for reading, validating, transforming, and saving tabular data with schema enforcement, foreign key resolution, and integrity checks.",
  "sources": "File paths, URLs, or arrays representing data sources; external storage resources.",
  "sinks": "Data validation, foreign key resolution, and saving to files or storage backends.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source to stream, through validation and foreign key resolution, then to output or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard data processing class with schema validation, foreign key management, and integrity checks. It uses common libraries and patterns without network activity or code injection. No malicious or obfuscated patterns are present. Exception handling is standard, and external dependencies are typical for data handling. The logic is straightforward, focusing on data validation, foreign key resolution, and saving. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured data processing module with no malicious intent or activity. It aligns with typical data validation and transformation libraries, with scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and a very low security risk (~0.1-0.2) due to potential untrusted data handling but no active threats.",
