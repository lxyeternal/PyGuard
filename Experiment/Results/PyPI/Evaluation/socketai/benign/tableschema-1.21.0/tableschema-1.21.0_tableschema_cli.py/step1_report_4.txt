{
  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for schema inference, validation, and information retrieval for table schema data.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, reads data file paths, reads schema inputs, and accesses configuration values.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via click.echo, reads files specified by --to_file, and calls external libraries for inference and validation.",
  "flows": "User input (file paths, options) -> data file reading (tableschema.infer) -> output or file writing; schema validation -> output messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. No use of obfuscated code or dynamic execution. Exception handling appears standard. No unusual data leaks or privacy violations detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines CLI commands for schema inference and validation using the tableschema library. It reads user-specified files and options, performs operations, and outputs results. Exception handling is in place to catch errors during schema inference and validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of external libraries appears standard. No suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a CLI wrapper for schema operations, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It processes input data and provides results without executing any suspicious or harmful actions.",
