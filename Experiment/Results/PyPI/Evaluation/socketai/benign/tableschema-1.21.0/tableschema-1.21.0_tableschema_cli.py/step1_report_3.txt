  "purpose": "Provides a command-line interface for data schema inference and validation using the tableschema library.",
  "sources": "Reads data file paths from CLI arguments, reads schema definitions from CLI arguments.",
  "sinks": "Outputs schema information and validation results to the console or files.",
  "flows": "User provides data or schema inputs -> CLI commands invoke tableschema functions -> Results are output to console or written to files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors, no hardcoded secrets, no hidden dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines CLI commands for schema inference and validation, utilizing the tableschema library. It handles user input and output securely, with exception handling that reports errors. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or sabotage. No suspicious external connections, no dynamic code execution, and no use of untrusted data in insecure ways.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward CLI utility for schema inference and validation without malicious intent or security risks. It relies on trusted libraries and handles data safely. No indicators of malware or malicious behavior are present.",
