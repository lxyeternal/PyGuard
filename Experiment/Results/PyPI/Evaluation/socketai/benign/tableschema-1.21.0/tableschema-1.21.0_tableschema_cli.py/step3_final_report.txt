{
  "purpose": "A command-line interface (CLI) wrapper for the 'tableschema' library, providing commands to infer, validate, and retrieve info about data schemas.",
  "sources": "Local file paths specified via CLI arguments, reading data files for inference and validation.",
  "sinks": "Standard output (console), files written to disk, JSON serialization.",
  "flows": "Input files are read during 'infer' and 'validate' commands; data is processed by 'tableschema' functions; results are output via console or written to files.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors detected. Exception handling is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI utility that delegates core functionality to the trusted 'tableschema' library. It processes local files for schema inference and validation, outputs results securely, and handles exceptions properly. No network activity, obfuscated code, or malicious patterns are present. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with benign utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign CLI wrapper for schema management, with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
