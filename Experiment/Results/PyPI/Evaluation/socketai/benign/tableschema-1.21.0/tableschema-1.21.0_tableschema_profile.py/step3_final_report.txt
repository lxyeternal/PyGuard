  "purpose": "This code provides a schema validation utility that loads profile definitions from local JSON files and validates descriptors against these schemas using jsonschema, with custom error handling.",
  "sources": "Loading profile JSON files from the 'profiles' directory; reading input descriptors for validation.",
  "sinks": "No network or data exfiltration points; validation errors are raised as exceptions locally.",
  "flows": "Profiles are loaded once during initialization; descriptors are validated via the validate() method, which may raise exceptions on errors.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code loads static JSON profiles, validates input data against schemas, and raises exceptions on validation errors. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. The profile files are loaded from local files, and validation is performed synchronously. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are evident. The validation process is standard, and error handling is appropriate. Overall, the code is a typical schema validation utility with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured JSON schema validation module with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
