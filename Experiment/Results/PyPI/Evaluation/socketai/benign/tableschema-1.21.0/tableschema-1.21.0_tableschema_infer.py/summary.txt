  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for schema inference, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The low scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. External dependencies, especially the 'Table' class, should be reviewed separately for security, but within this fragment, the code is safe."
