{
  "purpose": "A utility function to infer the schema of a data source, delegating to an external 'Table' class for processing.",
  "sources": "The 'source' parameter, which can be a path, URL, inline data, or a list of strings; internally, the code reads data via the 'Table' class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not write or transmit data directly.",
  "flows": "Input source -> 'Table' class instantiation -> 'infer' method -> output schema descriptor.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a lambda for string type checking; warning for deprecated argument order handling; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward wrapper around an external 'Table' class's 'infer' method, handling input source flexibility and issuing a deprecation warning for legacy argument order. It does not perform network operations, code execution, or handle untrusted data directly. The security of the overall process depends on the 'Table' class implementation, which is not provided. No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The code's logic is simple and clear, with no signs of malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function for schema inference, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The low scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. External dependencies, especially the 'Table' class, should be reviewed separately for security, but within this fragment, the code is safe.",
