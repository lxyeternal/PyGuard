  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence of issues, and assess the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The code is a wrapper around the 'Table' class, with no evident malicious behavior. The only notable aspect is the deprecated argument handling warning, which is standard for legacy support.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No logical errors or security flaws are identified. The warning for argument order is benign.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low). These seem reasonable given the benign nature.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The risk is low; no security vulnerabilities are evident.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's assessment aligns with the code. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Similar to Report 1, the code is a straightforward schema inference wrapper.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious patterns or malicious code.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. This is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No security concerns, just standard data processing.\n- **Conclusion:** The report's low risk score is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as above; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues; the code is standard.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Again, the code is a simple schema inference wrapper.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Valid assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Same as others; no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws:** No issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.0. Justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent. The code does not perform any malicious actions, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but all are low (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal security concern.\n\n### Final estimation:\n\nGiven the code's simplicity and the analysis, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** (very low, standard data processing utility)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a standard, safe utility function for schema inference with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores provided in the reports are reasonable and align with the code's behavior.",
