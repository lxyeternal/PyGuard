{
  "purpose": "Unit testing for jnius_config module functions related to JVM options and classpath configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, pytest, jnius_config; usage of jnius_config attributes and functions.",
  "targets": "Methods like set_options, add_options, set_classpath, add_classpath, and modifications to jnius_config.vm_running.",
  "flows": "Test functions call jnius_config methods which modify global variables; assertions check the state after modifications.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code is straightforward test code with no obfuscated or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a test class that resets jnius_config state before and after each test, then performs various method calls and state assertions. No external input is processed, and no network or system modifications are made beyond in-memory configuration. The code appears to be standard unit test code for a Java-Python bridge configuration module, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard test code for configuration functions, with no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It does not perform any unsafe operations or data leaks.",
