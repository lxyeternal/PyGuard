  "conclusion": "The script is a conventional build setup for JNI and Cython components with no evidence of malicious activity or backdoors. The main security consideration is reliance on environment variables and external sources, which could be exploited if the environment is compromised. Overall, the code is safe and aligns with its purpose, with a low to moderate security risk score justified by its external dependencies."
