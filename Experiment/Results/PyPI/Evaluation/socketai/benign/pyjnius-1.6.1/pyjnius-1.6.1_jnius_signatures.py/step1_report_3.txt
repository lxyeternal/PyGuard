{
  "purpose": "Provide an API for generating JNI signatures for Java methods in Python, specifically for use with PyJnius.",
  "sources": "Imports from . (local modules), class and function definitions, and data used for signature generation.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly evident; no untrusted data sinks like network, file, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data (types and classes) flow through signature() and _jni_type_spec() to produce JNI signature strings.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code is straightforward and well-structured for its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions to create JNI method signatures based on primitive types and Java class references. It utilizes class inheritance to represent primitive types and helper functions to assemble signature strings. No dynamic code execution, external network calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The use of local imports and class definitions appears to serve the intended purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a standard utility for generating JNI signatures in a Python environment with no indications of malicious behavior. It does not contain any malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe and functional for its stated purpose.",
