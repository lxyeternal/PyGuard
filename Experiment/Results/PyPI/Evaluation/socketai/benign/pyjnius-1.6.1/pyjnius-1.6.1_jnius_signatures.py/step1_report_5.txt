{
  "purpose": "Provide an API to generate JNI signatures for Java methods in Python, supporting primitives, arrays, and class types.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class definitions, function parameters, and constants used for signature generation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; signature functions generate strings based on provided types.",
  "flows": "Input type parameters flow into _jni_type_spec, which constructs signature strings. The signature function combines these into method signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors observed. Code mainly defines classes and functions for signature creation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines primitive type classes, a function to generate signatures for arrays, and constructs JNI method signatures based on input types. It properly differentiates between primitive types and class types, using issubclass checks and class attributes. There are no signs of code injection, network activity, or malicious data handling. The code appears to be a straightforward utility for JNI signature generation with no suspicious or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for creating JNI method signatures, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a helper module for JNI interactions without any harmful or suspicious components.",
