  "purpose": "Provides an API for generating JNI signatures for Java methods in Python, used with PyJnius.",
  "sources": "User-defined types for return and argument types, imported modules (__, JavaClass, java_method).",
  "sinks": "Signature generation functions, which process input types to produce JNI signature strings.",
  "flows": "Input types → _jni_type_spec → signature() → return signature string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, no code injection, and no suspicious code behavior observed. Usage of standard class and function definitions, no obfuscation, no dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes and functions for creating JNI method signatures, relying on type annotations and class inheritance. It imports other modules (__, JavaClass, java_method) but does not execute any code that could be malicious at runtime. The functions perform straightforward string concatenation and class checks, typical for a signature generation utility. No external network, file I/O, or data exfiltration code present. No suspicious dynamic execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected. The module appears to be a legitimate helper library for JNI signature generation, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for JNI signature creation, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. It adheres to expected patterns for such a utility and does not perform any harmful operations.",
