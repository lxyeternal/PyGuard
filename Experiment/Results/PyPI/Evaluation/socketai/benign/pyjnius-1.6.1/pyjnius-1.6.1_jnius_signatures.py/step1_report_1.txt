{
  "purpose": "Provides an API for creating JNI signatures for Java methods in Python, supporting primitive types, Java classes, and arrays.",
  "sources": "The module imports from its own package (. import JavaClass, java_method), and defines functions and classes that generate JNI signature strings based on provided types.",
  "sinks": "The signature() and _jni_type_spec() functions generate JNI method signatures, which could potentially be used in unsafe JNI calls if misused, but do not directly execute or invoke code.",
  "flows": "Input types (primitive types, JavaClass subclasses, arrays) flow into signature() -> _jni_type_spec(), producing signature strings that could be used in JNI calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code solely focuses on signature string generation without any external network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a set of primitive type classes, functions to generate JNI signatures, and utility functions for handling Java class signatures. It imports internal modules that are assumed to relate to JNI functionality. All operations are limited to signature string creation, with no dynamic code execution, external communication, or obfuscated constructs. The functions are straightforward, and no malicious behaviors or malicious intent are evident. The module appears safe and intended solely for JNI signature management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for JNI signature generation, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any dangerous actions such as network communication, data leakage, or code injection. Overall, it is safe for use within its intended scope.",
