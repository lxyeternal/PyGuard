{
  "purpose": "This setup.py script configures the packaging of the pyjnius project for distribution, including reading metadata and version information.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description; reads __init__.py in 'jnius' directory to extract __version__",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no execution of untrusted input; setup() call is standard for packaging",
  "flows": "Reads version info from __init__.py; provides data to setup() for package creation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no unusual code behavior observed; straightforward packaging script",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files (README.md, __init__.py) to gather package metadata and version. It then constructs a dictionary with package configuration. The code is standard for Python packaging and contains no dynamic code execution, network activity, or other suspicious behavior. No anomalous patterns, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for packaging a Python project. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It merely reads metadata and calls setup().",
