  "purpose": "Create a source distribution package for the pyjnius Python module.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file for long description, reads the __init__.py file in the 'jnius' directory to extract version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md to obtain long description -> Reads __init__.py to extract version -> Passes package info to setup() for building distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no network operations or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a straightforward setup.py used for packaging. It reads the README file and the version from the __init__.py file, then passes this information along with package metadata to setuptools.setup(). There are no external inputs from untrusted sources, no network operations, no dynamic code execution, nor any malicious code patterns. The script's purpose aligns with standard packaging practices and contains no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py is a standard packaging script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It simply reads files and prepares package metadata for distribution.",
