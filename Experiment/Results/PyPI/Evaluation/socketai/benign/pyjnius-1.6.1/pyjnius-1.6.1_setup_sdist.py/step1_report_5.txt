{
  "purpose": "Create a source distribution setup for the 'pyjnius' Python package.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description, reads '__init__.py' in 'jnius' directory for version info, and gathers package metadata.",
  "targets": "No specific untrusted data sources or sinks; setup process is standard.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from a file, then runs setup with collected metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded secrets or backdoors, and no dynamic code execution. Uses standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a README file and extracts version information from the '__init__.py' file in the 'jnius' directory. It then defines setup parameters for packaging. There are no suspicious code injections, no hardcoded credentials, and no dynamic execution or network operations. The overall structure is typical for a Python package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This setup.py script appears benign and follows standard practices for Python package distribution. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
