{
  "purpose": "The script is used for creating a source distribution package for a Python project, specifically configuring package metadata and setup options.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading '__init__.py' in 'jnius' directory to extract version.",
  "sinks": "None identified; the code does not write or execute untrusted data, nor does it handle sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> stores in README; Reads __init__.py -> extracts version -> used in setup kwargs; setup() called with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, no suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: reading files for metadata, setting package configuration, and invoking setuptools.setup(). It correctly reads version info from a file, uses standard practices, and has no signs of malicious activity. There are no input vectors for injection or data exfiltration. No secret keys, network connections, or backdoors are present. The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration script for packaging.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python setup file for packaging, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
