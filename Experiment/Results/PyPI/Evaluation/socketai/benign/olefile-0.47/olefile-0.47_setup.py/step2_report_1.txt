  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is a standard setup script, with no suspicious behavior or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward, importing package metadata, reading README.md, and calling setup(). No dynamic code, network activity, or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with a slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1). The reason for this is not explicitly detailed but perhaps considering the potential for reading external files.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1\n- **Justification:** Since the code only reads 'README.md' and imports version/author info, and performs no malicious activity, the low risk score seems justified. The malware score remains zero.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Again, a typical setup script with no suspicious elements.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior; the code reads package info and a README file, then calls setup(). No external code execution or data leaks.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; standard setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, no external communications.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; a straightforward setup script.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0\n- **Justification:** No suspicious patterns or malicious intent detected.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly identified no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports correctly assigned zero; no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but all are very low (0 or 0.1), which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected or suspected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a typical, well-structured setup script for a Python package, with no suspicious patterns, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The only external file read is 'README.md', which is standard and not risky.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent with the code. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
