{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the olefile Python package, used for installing the package via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata from __version__ and __author__ imported from olefile, reads README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None of the data read from sources is used in a way that would cause data leaks or untrusted code execution. No network, file, or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Reads version and author info, reads README content, then passes data to setuptools.setup() which handles installation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code. All operations are standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and package metadata, reads README.md for description, defines setup parameters, and calls setup() function. No code injection, network calls, or sensitive data handling occurs. No suspicious code patterns or unusual behaviors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It performs typical package installation configuration without executing any untrusted code or leaking data.",
