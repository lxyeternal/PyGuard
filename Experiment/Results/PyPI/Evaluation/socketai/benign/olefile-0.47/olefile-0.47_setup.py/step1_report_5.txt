  "purpose": "Installation script for the olefile Python package, used to parse Microsoft OLE2 files.",
  "sources": "Reads package metadata, version info, author info, and the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "Uses setuptools.setup() to configure package installation parameters; no direct untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads package metadata and README, then passes them to setup(), with no flow of untrusted input to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious imports. The only potentially dynamic operation is reading 'README.md', which is standard for package descriptions.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools. It reads metadata variables and a README file, then calls setup() with static and dynamic data. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are used in a way that could lead to malicious activity. The code structure is straightforward, with no obfuscation or unusual constructs. The only external data read is 'README.md', which is typical for package long descriptions and does not introduce security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign setup script for the olefile package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code execution. It is safe for use.",
