  "purpose": "Setup script for installing the olefile Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads the package version and author info from olefile module, reads README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data is written or executed.",
  "flows": "Reads version and author from olefile, reads README.md, and passes metadata to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, no obfuscation, no external network calls or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures: importing setuptools, extracting package metadata, reading README.md, and calling setup(). No untrusted input, no code execution, and no external communications are present. It uses straightforward package installation code, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The imported olefile module's __version__ and __author__ are assumed to be safe since they are imported from a trusted package. No anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears benign, performing typical package installation tasks without any malicious or suspicious elements.",
