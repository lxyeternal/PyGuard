  "purpose": "Setup script for installing the olefile Python package, providing package metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads version and author information from olefile module, reads 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no data is written or transmitted outside the local environment.",
  "flows": "Reads version and author data from olefile module, reads README.md, then passes all info to setuptools.setup.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior observed. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, no obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script. It imports package metadata from the olefile module, reads a README file for description, defines package metadata, and calls setuptools.setup() with this info. No user input, network activity, or dynamic execution is present. The code appears to serve its intended purpose of packaging without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical and benign setup script with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks.",
