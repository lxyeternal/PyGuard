  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing symbols and metadata from the local olefile package to expose its API and attributes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local olefile module and metadata attributes (__version__, __author__, __date__, __all__)",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports symbols and metadata without data flow or execution logic",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of import statements and documentation comments",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup with import statements and metadata attributes. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or dynamic code. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. The code is typical for a package's __init__.py or setup module, serving to expose symbols and metadata without any security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
