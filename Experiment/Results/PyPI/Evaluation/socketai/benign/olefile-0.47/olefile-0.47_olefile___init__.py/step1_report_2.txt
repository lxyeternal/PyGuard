{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface for reading and writing Microsoft OLE2 structured storage files, supporting compatibility with various Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for olefile module and its metadata attributes (__version__, __author__, __date__, __all__).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or data leaks; import statements are generally safe and do not process external data at runtime.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports modules and metadata; there are no data flows involving untrusted data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward and only contains import statements with no dynamic or obfuscated behavior. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports functions and metadata from the olefile module, which is a library for handling OLE2 files. It does not process or handle data directly, nor does it execute untrusted code. The purpose is documentation and setup for the module. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation are evident. The code is purely structural and informational, with no runtime vulnerabilities or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard module import section for the olefile library, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected. It appears safe and intended solely for importing functionality and metadata.",
