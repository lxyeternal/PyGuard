  "purpose": "The code provides an interface for reading and writing Microsoft OLE2 files, and includes metadata about the module and its author.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.olefile and .olefile) to load functionality and metadata.",
  "sinks": "None present; no handling of untrusted data or external inputs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules and defines metadata, with no data flow or processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import of modules and metadata. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports functions and metadata from internal modules. No user input, network operations, or data processing occurs here. The module appears to be a standard library component with no malicious intent or suspicious constructs. The focus is on module setup and metadata definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of import statements and metadata declarations without any suspicious or malicious content. It does not perform any actions that could compromise security.",
