  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple import statements and documentation comments.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, or external data handling is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code appears to be part of a package's `__init__.py` or module setup, intended solely for exposing functionality and metadata.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code only imports symbols from a local module `olefile` and some metadata attributes.\n- There are no sinks, no data flows, and no executable logic.\n- The reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign and safe.\n\n**Scores and justifications:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Critical assessment:**\n- The code does not contain any embedded or hidden malicious logic.\n- Import statements are safe and standard in Python modules.\n- The presence of metadata attributes does not pose any security risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is a benign, standard module setup with no security concerns.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Final note:**\n- No further action is needed; the code is safe and well-understood.",
