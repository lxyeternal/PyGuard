{
  "purpose": "This code implements a standard SDK client for Tencent Cloud's Anicloud API, providing methods to check app ID existence, query resources, and retrieve resource info.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from request objects via _serialize() and request headers.",
  "sinks": "Network calls via self.call() where untrusted data could potentially be transmitted; JSON response parsing and deserialization into models.",
  "flows": "Request objects are serialized and sent through self.call(), responses are received as JSON, parsed, and deserialized into response models.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious code patterns, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward SDK client with standard request serialization, network communication, and response handling. It does not contain obfuscation, malicious code, or backdoors. Exception handling is typical, and no insecure patterns are evident. The network interactions are standard for SDKs, and the code relies on external trusted modules. The reports uniformly identify the code as benign, with malware scores of 0 and low security risks. The scores are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious SDK client implementation with no signs of obfuscation or security vulnerabilities. It poses negligible supply chain security risk and is safe for use.",
