{
  "purpose": "Define data models for Tencent Cloud API requests and responses related to resource and app ID checking, resource querying, and resource details.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from dictionary parameters in _deserialize methods, property setters/getters, and class constructors.",
  "sinks": "Potential data output via property getters and API response serialization; no untrusted data is directly written to external sinks such as network, files, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Input data from external sources (API responses) flows into class attributes via _deserialize; data from class attributes can be accessed via getters for further processing or output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected. The code uses standard class definitions, property decorators, and warnings for unused fields; no obfuscation, code injection, or malicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python class definitions for API request and response data models. It employs typical patterns: __init__ constructors, property decorators for attribute access, and _deserialize methods for populating data from dictionaries. There is consistent use of warnings to flag unused fields, which is a normal practice. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or handling of sensitive data like credentials or tokens is observed. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of data schemas with no indication of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical SDK data model layer with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It defines request/response structures for cloud resource APIs without any suspicious activities. No malware, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
