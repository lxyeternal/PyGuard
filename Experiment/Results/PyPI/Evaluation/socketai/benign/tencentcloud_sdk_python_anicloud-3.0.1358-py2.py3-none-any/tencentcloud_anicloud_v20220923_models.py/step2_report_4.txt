  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**  \n   All reports clearly state that the code consists solely of data model definitions, with no network calls, file operations, code injection, obfuscation, or other suspicious behaviors. They highlight that the code is standard SDK or API request/response schemas.\n\n2. **Code Functionality & Logic:**  \n   The code uses typical Python class structures, property decorators, and deserialization methods. Warnings for unused fields are standard practice and do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n3. **Potential Security Risks:**  \n   No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present. The data flows are internal, from input dictionaries to class attributes, with no external data transmission or execution.\n\n4. **Malware & Obfuscation Scores:**  \n   All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n5. **Scores Consistency & Justification:**  \n   The risk scores are low (mostly 0 or close to 0.1), which is appropriate given the nature of the code. The detailed reasoning supports that these are standard data models.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks or vulnerabilities detected.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is purely structural, serving as data schemas for API communication. It is standard, well-structured, and contains no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \nNo changes needed. The scores and conclusions are appropriate based on the provided code and reports.",
