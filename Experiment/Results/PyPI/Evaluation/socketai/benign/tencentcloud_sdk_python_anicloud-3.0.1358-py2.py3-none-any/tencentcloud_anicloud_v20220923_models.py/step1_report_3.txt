  "purpose": "Define data models for Tencent Cloud API requests and responses related to app and resource management.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in constructors, deserialization methods, property setters, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially exposed data in properties, deserialization outputs, and warnings.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., 'params' in '_deserialize') to object properties, with no data being transmitted externally.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code patterns; only standard data model definitions and serialization logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for request and response models using typical Python patterns, including property getters/setters and deserialization methods. The 'warnings' module is used to flag unused parameters. No external network calls, code execution, or obfuscated segments are present. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. Usage of a well-known SDK import (tencentcloud.common.abstract_model) is standard. The presence of license comments and adherence to standard patterns suggest legitimate code structure.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be standard, auto-generated data models for API communication. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It functions solely for data encapsulation and serialization within a legitimate SDK context.",
