  "sinks": "There are no sinks; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only contains static comments and a version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is a standard license header and version indicator.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of licensing comments and a single variable assignment setting __version__ to a string. There are no executable code, no input reading, no data processing, and no potential security-sensitive operations. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected in this fragment.",
