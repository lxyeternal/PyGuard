  "purpose": "This code serves as a licensing header with version information, providing metadata about the software component.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ = '3.0.1358') and comments containing licensing information.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code contains only comments and a variable assignment with no data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static metadata without dynamic or input-driven behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of comments and a version variable, with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static licensing header with a version variable. It contains no executable logic, data processing, or dynamic code. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is benign, and the assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard open-source licensing header with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores accurately reflect its benign nature, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
