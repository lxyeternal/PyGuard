  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality:**\n   - The code is a simple constant definition:\n     ```python\n     INVALIDPARAMETER = 'InvalidParameter'\n     ```\n   - It includes licensing comments, which are standard.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, dynamic logic, or data flows.\n   - No external dependencies or data sources are involved.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could be malicious.\n   - It does not handle or process untrusted data.\n   - No obfuscation, hidden logic, or suspicious constructs are present.\n   - The constant appears to be a standard error message used in larger codebases, likely for input validation.\n\n3. **Assessment of the Reports:**\n   - All reports agree that the code is benign, straightforward, and standard.\n   - The confidence scores are 1.0, indicating certainty about the benign nature.\n   - Malware scores are 0.0 across all reports, which aligns with the code's simplicity.\n   - Security risk scores are also 0.0, which is appropriate.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns or Flaws:**\n   - No issues or anomalies are identified.\n   - The code snippet is isolated and does not demonstrate any malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n   - The reports do not suggest any obfuscation or suspicious patterns.\n\n5. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - The malware score of 0.0 is justified.\n   - The obfuscated score of 0.0 is justified.\n   - The overall security risk score of 0.0 is justified.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- The current scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is a benign, straightforward constant declaration with no malicious or security concerns.\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments, confirming that the code is safe and poses no security threat.",
