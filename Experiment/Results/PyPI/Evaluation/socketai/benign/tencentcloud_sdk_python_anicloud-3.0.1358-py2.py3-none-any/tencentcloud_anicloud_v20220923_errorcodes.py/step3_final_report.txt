{
  "purpose": "Define a constant error message 'InvalidParameter' for use in larger codebases, accompanied by licensing information.",
  "sources": "The code reads a static string assignment; no external data sources or inputs are involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external interactions; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; the constant is assigned statically and used as a value elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static constant declaration with licensing comments. It does not perform any logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with high confidence (1.0). No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The constant is a typical pattern in API development, and in isolation, it poses no threat. The malware score is justified as 0, obfuscated score as 0, and security risk score as 0.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward constant declaration with no malicious or security concerns. The scores are accurate and should remain unchanged.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
  "malware": 0.0,
  "securityRisk": 0.0,
