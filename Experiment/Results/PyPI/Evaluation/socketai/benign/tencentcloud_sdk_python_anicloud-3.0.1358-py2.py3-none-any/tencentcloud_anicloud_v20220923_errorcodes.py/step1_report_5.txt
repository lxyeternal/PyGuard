{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define an error constant for parameter validation in a larger software project, likely related to Tencent's SDK or API.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading; the code only defines a constant.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no data flows to untrusted areas.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard, and contains no suspicious or unusual logic. No hardcoded credentials or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a copyright notice, license information, and a single constant assignment. There are no complex structures, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling. The license and comments are standard for open-source projects and do not suggest malicious intent. The constant 'INVALIDPARAMETER' simply holds an error string, which is typical for error handling in APIs or SDKs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward constant declaration with licensing information, showing no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
