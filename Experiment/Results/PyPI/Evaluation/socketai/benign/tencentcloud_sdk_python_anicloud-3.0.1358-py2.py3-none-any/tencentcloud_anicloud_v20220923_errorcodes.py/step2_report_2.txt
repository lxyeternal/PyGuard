  "review": "Let's review the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is a simple constant declaration (`INVALIDPARAMETER`) with licensing comments. There are no dynamic elements, input handling, or data flows. The code is static and straightforward.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**  \nNone of the reports find any anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The code does not interact with external data, perform I/O, or contain any logic that could be exploited.\n\n3. **Error in the Report's Logic or Reasoning**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign and standard for error handling.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.  \n- **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified.\n\n5. **Potential for Overlooked Risks**  \nGiven the code snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. The constant could be part of a larger, potentially risky system, but in isolation, it is safe.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**  \nThe only point to consider is that the constant is named `INVALIDPARAMETER`, which is a common pattern in APIs for error messages. If this constant were used improperly elsewhere (e.g., in a way that exposes sensitive info or is misused in error handling), that could be a concern, but this cannot be inferred from the snippet alone.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 (correct)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 (correct)\n\n**Final Justification:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign constant definition with licensing comments. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities in this isolated snippet.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate after review:\n- **Malware:** 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.0  \n- **Risk:** 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the reports and the code's nature.",
