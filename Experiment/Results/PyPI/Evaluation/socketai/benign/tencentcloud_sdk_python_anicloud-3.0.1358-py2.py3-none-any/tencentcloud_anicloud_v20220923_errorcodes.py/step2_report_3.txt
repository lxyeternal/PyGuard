  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Context**:  \n   The code is a simple, static constant definition:\n   ```python\n   INVALIDPARAMETER = 'InvalidParameter'\n   ```\n   accompanied by licensing comments. It does not perform any logic, I/O, or data handling. It is a typical pattern in API or SDK development to define error message constants.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements**:  \n   - No dynamic code, no obfuscated code, no hidden logic.\n   - No external data input, no network calls, no data sinks.\n   - No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or suspicious code constructs.\n   - Licensing comments are standard and do not suggest malicious intent.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Reports**:  \n   All reports uniformly conclude that the code is benign, with a confidence of 1.0, and no anomalies, malware, or security risks. They correctly identify this as a straightforward constant declaration.\n\n4. **Scores and Justification**:\n   - **Malware Score**: 0.0 is appropriate, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0 is appropriate, the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - **Risk Score**: 0.0 is appropriate, no security risk is present.\n\n5. **Any Errors or Flaws in the Reports?**  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly interpret the code as benign, with no suspicious elements. There are no logical flaws or overestimations.\n\n6. **Potential for Changes in Scores?**  \n   Since the code is trivial and clearly benign, no score adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final Assessment**:  \n- **Malware Score**: 0.0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0.0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the consensus in the reports.\n\n**Summary**:  \nThe code snippet is a standard constant declaration with licensing comments, posing no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation. The reports are accurate, and no modifications are needed.",
