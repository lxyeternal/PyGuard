  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple constant assignment defining an error message (`INVALIDPARAMETER`) with licensing comments.\n   - There are no external inputs, no dynamic logic, no data flows, and no interactions with untrusted data sources.\n   - The code is static and straightforward, serving as part of a larger system.\n\n2. **Malicious Behavior & Anomalies**:\n   - No report detects any anomalies such as obfuscation, suspicious logic, or embedded malicious code.\n   - The comments and license are standard and do not indicate any malicious intent.\n   - The constant is typical for error handling and does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n\n3. **Scores & Justification**:\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the absence of obfuscation.\n   - The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n4. **Potential Risks & Assumptions**:\n   - The reports correctly challenge any claims of vulnerabilities based solely on this snippet, emphasizing that it's a static constant with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - There are no assumptions about vulnerabilities that need to be challenged here.\n\n5. **Overall Consistency & Reasonableness**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are zero or near-zero, reflecting the benign nature.\n   - The confidence levels are high (1.0), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0.0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: 0.0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThis code snippet is entirely benign, serving as a constant definition with licensing comments. It poses no security threat, malware risk, or obfuscation concerns. The scores assigned by the reports are appropriate and should remain as is.\n\n**Summary**:\n- The code is safe.\n- No changes needed to the scores.\n- The analysis aligns with the code's nature.\n\n**Final recommendation**: Keep the scores at malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.0, risk=0.0.",
