{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a constant error message for invalid parameters, likely used in a larger software project for error handling.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own source to define a string constant; no external data input is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing functions are present; no untrusted data handling or output is observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs are present; the code is straightforward and well-formatted.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard declaration of a constant string representing an error message, with licensing comments and no dynamic or malicious content. It contains no input handling, no external data sources, and no code execution logic. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a simple constant definition for error messaging. It shows no indications of malware or security risks.",
