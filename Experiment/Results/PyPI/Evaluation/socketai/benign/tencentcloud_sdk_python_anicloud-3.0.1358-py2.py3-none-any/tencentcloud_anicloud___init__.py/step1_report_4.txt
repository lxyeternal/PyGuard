  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, user input via function parameters, and possibly external modules or files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions like print, logging, or network calls if present, which could send untrusted data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input parameters to sinks such as output functions or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. The structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for common security issues such as code injection, data leakage, insecure environment variable use, or malicious network activity. It primarily uses standard libraries and functions, with no suspicious external domain calls or file modifications. No malicious behavior or sabotage indicators are observed. The code does not contain obfuscated sections, and the control flow is typical for utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, there are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code. The code appears benign and safe for use within the scope of its functionality.",
