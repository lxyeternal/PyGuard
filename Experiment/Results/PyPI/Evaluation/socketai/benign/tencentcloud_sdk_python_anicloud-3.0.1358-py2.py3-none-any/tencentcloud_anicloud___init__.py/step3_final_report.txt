  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input parameters, external files, network resources (if code present).",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variable access, output functions.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing functions, network calls, or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual data flows, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate either benign code, missing code, or placeholders with no suspicious patterns. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the descriptions. For reports lacking code, the low confidence and minimal scores are appropriate. The detailed reasoning in each report supports their conclusions. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks is found in the provided context.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment is that the code is benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The scores are justified and consistent with the evidence. No further action or revision is necessary.",
