  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic execution functions (eval(), exec()), environment variables, file/network I/O, potential hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval() or environment variables flow into execution or data handling sinks, potentially leading to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec() without clear payloads, minimal or no code, no obfuscation, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets primarily involve dynamic features like eval() or exec(), which are flagged as potential risk factors but are not inherently malicious. No explicit malicious payloads, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are identified. The minimal or absent code limits definitive conclusions, but the overall structure appears benign. The dynamic features warrant caution but do not confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0—are consistent with the evidence. The moderate risk scores (0.2-0.4) reflect potential exploitation avenues but lack active malicious activity. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited code context. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected beyond the use of dynamic execution functions.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears benign with no evidence of malicious payloads or obfuscation. The presence of dynamic features like eval() introduces some risk but does not confirm malicious intent. The scoring across reports is consistent and justified. Overall, the dependency is low-risk, and no immediate security concerns are identified.",
