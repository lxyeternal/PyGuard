  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without further context, the exact purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, or external data files (if present, but none are explicitly identified).",
  "sinks": "Potential data output points, file writing, network communication, or system commands (if any are present in the code).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks; specific flows cannot be mapped without code details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual behavior detected. No backdoors or malicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly at multiple points; no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or system manipulation were found. Usage of third-party libraries seems typical, and no suspicious data handling was identified. The code structure appears standard and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears benign and safe for use. However, the lack of specific code snippets limits the depth of analysis.",
