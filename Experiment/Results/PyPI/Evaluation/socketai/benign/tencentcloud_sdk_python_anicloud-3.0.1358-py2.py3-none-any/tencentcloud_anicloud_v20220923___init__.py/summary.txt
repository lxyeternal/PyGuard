  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears benign with no evidence of malicious payloads or obfuscation. The presence of dynamic features like eval() introduces some risk but does not confirm malicious intent. The scoring across reports is consistent and justified. Overall, the dependency is low-risk, and no immediate security concerns are identified."
