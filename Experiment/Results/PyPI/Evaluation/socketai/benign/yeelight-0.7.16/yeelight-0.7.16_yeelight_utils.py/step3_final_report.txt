  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting RGB color values into a YeeLight-compatible integer format.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'red', 'green', 'blue' in rgb_to_yeelight; input values to _clamp.",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs internal calculations without external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> _clamp function -> rgb_to_yeelight calculation -> return combined integer",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: 'rgb_to_yeelight' which clamps RGB values between 0 and 255 and combines them into a single integer, and '_clamp' which constrains a value within specified bounds. The logic is correct, simple, and performs a common utility task. No external dependencies, network activity, or malicious constructs are present. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or obfuscation. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further issues or risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for RGB to device-specific color value conversion. It contains no malicious or suspicious elements, and the scoring in the reports accurately reflects its benign nature. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
