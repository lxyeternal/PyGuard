  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports identify the code as only import statements from the 'yeelight' library.\n- No executable logic, data processing, network activity, or external input handling is present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger application or library for controlling YeeLight RGB bulbs.\n\n**Malware and Obfuscation Scores:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which aligns with the straightforward import statements.\n\n**Security Risk:**\n- All reports assign a security risk score of 0, which is reasonable because no risky operations are performed here.\n\n**Score Justification & Recommendations:**\n- The consistent low scores across all reports are justified.\n- Since the code is only import statements, there's no reason to increase malware or security risk scores.\n- The confidence level of 1 in all reports is appropriate.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n- While the reports are accurate for this snippet, if in the larger application these imports are used to process untrusted data or trigger network activity, risks could emerge. But based solely on this code fragment, no issues are present.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is benign, purely import statements, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security concerns. The current scoring reflects this accurately.",
