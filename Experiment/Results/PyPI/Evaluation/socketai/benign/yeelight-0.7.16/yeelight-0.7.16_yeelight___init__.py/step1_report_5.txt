  "purpose": "This code appears to be a library for controlling YeeLight RGB bulbs, providing imports for enums, flow transitions, and main control classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'yeelight' modules, which are used for controlling and configuring the bulbs.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or external communication in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible here as this code only imports modules and classes; no execution or data handling is present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is standard import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements from the 'yeelight' package, intended for device control. There are no functions, data processing, or external communications. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior is observable. The structure and format are typical for a library's module setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import setup for a YeeLight control library. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
