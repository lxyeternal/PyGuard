  "purpose": "Utility module providing decorators, dynamic function creation, context managers, and dispatch mechanisms, primarily for internal use and code generation via string templates.",
  "sources": "Function objects, string templates for code generation, internal function definitions",
  "sinks": "exec and compile functions used to generate and execute code from strings",
  "flows": "Source data (function objects, code templates) into string templates, then into exec/compile for execution",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec and compile on internally generated code; no external untrusted input processed; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code employs dynamic code generation via string templates and exec/compile, which inherently pose security risks if untrusted inputs are incorporated. In the provided code, templates are static and controlled, reducing immediate danger. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary concern is the pattern of executing dynamically generated code, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated. The malware score is 0, as no malicious intent is evident. The obfuscated score is 0, given the code clarity. The risk score is low (~0.2-0.4), depending on context, but in the current controlled environment, it remains low.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility library for dynamic function and decorator creation, with inherent risks due to the use of exec and compile. No evidence of malicious activity or backdoors exists. The scores should reflect a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk (~0.2-0.4). Proper handling and validation are recommended if inputs become untrusted. Overall, the code is safe in its current form but warrants caution regarding dynamic code execution patterns.",
