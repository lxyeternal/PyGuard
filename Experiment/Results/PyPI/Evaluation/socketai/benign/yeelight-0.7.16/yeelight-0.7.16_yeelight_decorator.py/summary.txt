  "malware_score": 0,
  "security_risk": 0.3,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility library for dynamic function and decorator creation, with inherent risks due to the use of exec and compile. No evidence of malicious activity or backdoors exists. The scores should reflect a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a low security risk (~0.2-0.4). Proper handling and validation are recommended if inputs become untrusted. Overall, the code is safe in its current form but warrants caution regarding dynamic code execution patterns."
