{
  "purpose": "The code is designed for discovering and parsing capabilities of Yeelight smart bulbs over a network using SSDP protocol, and for sending discovery packets via multicast.",
  "sources": "Reads interface name input in get_ip_address(), and network data received in parse_capabilities()",
  "sinks": "Sends UDP packets in send_discovery_packet(), reads network data in parse_capabilities()",
  "flows": "Input parameters (interface name, IP address, data) flow into socket configuration and data parsing functions; network data received by socket in send_discovery_packet() flows into parse_capabilities()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; code appears to be straightforward network discovery. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures. No external or suspicious network connections; no unusual data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard network discovery tasks: obtaining IP address for a given interface, constructing and sending SSDP discovery messages over UDP multicast, and parsing response data into dictionaries. Functions are well-structured, with no signs of malicious behavior. No hardcoded sensitive data or backdoors are present. The code uses standard libraries (socket, ifaddr) for network operations, and the data parsing logic is straightforward. There are no indications of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious backdoors. The only potential concern is network-related operations that depend on user-supplied interface names and IP addresses, but these are typical in network discovery scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate network discovery code for Yeelight devices. There are no signs of malware, malicious backdoors, or security risks. The overall security risk is minimal, and no malicious intent is evident.",
