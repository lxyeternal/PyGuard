{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform SSDP discovery for devices (specifically Yeelight bulbs), including sending discovery packets and parsing responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads network interface information via get_ip_address(), socket data via s.sendto(), and SSDP response data via parse_capabilities().",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include socket.sendto() for network transmission and data returned from parse_capabilities().",
  "flows": "get_ip_address() obtains interface IPs, which influence socket multicast configuration; send_discovery_packet() constructs and sends SSDP discovery message over network; parse_capabilities() processes received data for device info.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns. No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code. Use of socket for network communication is standard for SSDP discovery.",
  "analysis": "The code performs network interface querying, constructs SSDP discovery messages, and sends them via UDP multicast. It correctly manages socket options and timeouts. The data parsing function decodes SSDP response data into a dictionary, filtering HTTP headers and device info. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. All functions appear legitimate and aligned with standard device discovery practices. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are present. The network communication is straightforward and typical for SSDP/multicast discovery.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of SSDP device discovery for Yeelight bulbs. It does not contain malicious behaviors or supply chain risks. The use of network sockets and data parsing is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe, with low malware and security risk scores.",
