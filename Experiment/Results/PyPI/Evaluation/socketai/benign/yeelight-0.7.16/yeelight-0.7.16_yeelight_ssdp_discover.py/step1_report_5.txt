{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to perform SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol) discovery for wifi bulbs, specifically sending multicast discovery packets and parsing responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads network interface data via get_adapters() from the 'ifaddr' library and network data from SSDP responses.",
  "sinks": "The code sends UDP packets over the network using socket.sendto(). It also processes incoming data in parse_capabilities(), but does not send or store data externally.",
  "flows": "The flow involves obtaining interface IP via get_ip_address(), constructing and sending SSDP discovery packets via send_discovery_packet(), and parsing responses with parse_capabilities(). No external data sinks are directly invoked beyond network transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code. Usage of socket for network communication is standard; no obfuscation or hidden code detected. No dynamic code execution or suspicious external connections are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs network discovery using standard socket operations and network interface querying. It constructs SSDP M-SEARCH packets and sends them via multicast or specified IP, then parses responses into a dictionary. No malicious or suspicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware patterns, is evident. All data flows are typical for network discovery routines. No anomalies or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate network discovery utility for wifi bulbs with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It utilizes common network programming practices without suspicious behaviors or backdoors.",
