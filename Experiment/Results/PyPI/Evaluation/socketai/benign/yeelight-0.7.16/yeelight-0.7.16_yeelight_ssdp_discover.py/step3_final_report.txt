  "purpose": "Implement SSDP discovery for Yeelight bulbs, sending multicast packets and parsing responses.",
  "sources": "Network interface querying (get_ip_address), socket.sendto for SSDP packet transmission.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Interface IP retrieval flows into socket multicast configuration, which then sends SSDP discovery messages.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard network operations and no obfuscation or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard SSDP discovery using socket programming, querying network interfaces, constructing multicast messages, and parsing responses. No malicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets are present. The functions operate within expected norms for device discovery. The security implications are minimal, with no evidence of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of SSDP device discovery for Yeelight bulbs. It contains no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2) are appropriate and justified based on its functionality and behavior.",
