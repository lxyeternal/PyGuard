  "purpose": "Defines classes for controlling YeeLight smart bulbs, including transitions and flow management, to generate device commands based on user parameters.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters for transition and flow classes, internal validation via _clamp, and configuration settings.",
  "sinks": "Internal command list generation and expression string assembly; no external data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through validation to command list creation and expression assembly, with no external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors detected; use of standard validation and logging.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, well-structured SDK for controlling YeeLight devices, with input validation, no network or external data handling, and no obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0 and very low security risk scores (0 to 0.2). The code does not perform any malicious actions, data exfiltration, or contain suspicious patterns. The warning about transition count exceeding 9 is benign. Overall, the code is safe, legitimate, and free from malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign device control library with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The supply chain security risk is minimal. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
