{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves and stores project metadata information from the package's distribution metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata using the importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present; no data leaks or harmful actions occur.",
  "flows": "Metadata is fetched from the package distribution, then stored in variables without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code uses standard library functions for metadata access.",
  "analysis": "The code safely accesses package metadata using standard library functions, with a fallback for older Python versions. It assigns metadata fields to variables, which could be used elsewhere but pose no immediate security risk. No data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious activity are present. The code appears to be purely informational and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, non-malicious metadata retrieval script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
