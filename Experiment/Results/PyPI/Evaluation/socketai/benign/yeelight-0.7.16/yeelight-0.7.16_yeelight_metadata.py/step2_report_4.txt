  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code is a standard metadata retrieval snippet, using `importlib.metadata` (or fallback `importlib_metadata`) to fetch package info.\n- It accesses the 'Version' and 'Summary' keys from the package metadata.\n- No external input, network activity, or suspicious logic is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.\n- The code is straightforward and intended for project info purposes.\n\n---\n\n### Review of individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate; metadata extraction for 'yeelight'.\n- **Analysis:** Correct, no anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Score:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard code.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Correct, no anomalies or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n- **Note:** The securityRisk score is 0.1, which is very low, reflecting minimal concern.\n- **Justification:** Since the code is read-only metadata retrieval with no external effects, a security risk of 0.1 might be slightly overcautious but still acceptable.\n- **Verdict:** The securityRisk score could be lowered to 0, but 0.1 is acceptable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate.\n- **Analysis:** Correct.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malware.\n- The malware score is appropriately zero across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score is zero, as the code is straightforward.\n- The securityRisk scores are minimal, reflecting the non-malicious nature of the code.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe metadata retrieval snippet with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The reported scores are consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are appropriate, and the code is safe.",
