{
  "purpose": "The code extracts project metadata from the package using importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata, primarily for project information display or management.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package name 'yeelight' and retrieves metadata via importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data flows to potentially malicious operations or external systems.",
  "flows": "The package name is used to get metadata, which then flows into variables storing version, description, authors, and other metadata; no untrusted data flow is detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code attempts to import modules dynamically based on environment (importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata), which is standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscation or unusual code structures are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code's main function is to obtain package metadata for the specified package 'yeelight'. It conditionally imports metadata functions depending on the Python environment, then retrieves and stores key project information such as version, description, authors, and URLs. This is typical for project setup or documentation purposes. No input/output, network calls, or data leaks are present. The code does not perform any malicious activity, nor does it contain suspicious behavior or hardcoded credentials.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a straightforward retrieval of package metadata for informational purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks.",
