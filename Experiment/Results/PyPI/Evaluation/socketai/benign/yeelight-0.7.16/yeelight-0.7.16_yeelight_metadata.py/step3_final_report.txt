  "purpose": "Retrieve package metadata such as version, description, authors, license, and URL for the 'yeelight' package.",
  "sources": "Import statements for importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata, calling metadata(package), accessing metadata fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs, network connections, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Importing metadata module -> calling metadata(package) -> extracting fields like Version and Summary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward retrieval of package metadata using standard library functions with conditional import for compatibility. It accesses known metadata fields without processing untrusted input or performing network operations. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present. The code is simple, readable, and intended solely for project info purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is a standard implementation for fetching package metadata. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0) are accurate and appropriate.",
