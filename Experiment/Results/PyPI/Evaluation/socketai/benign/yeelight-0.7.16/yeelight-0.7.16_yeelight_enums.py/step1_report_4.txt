{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations for various device and scene types related to smart lighting control.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines classes and enums with hardcoded values.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or data manipulation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code consists solely of enum class definitions with no hidden or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code provides enumeration classes for device types, power modes, scene types, etc., used for controlling smart bulbs. It uses standard Python enum definitions with no external data sources, user input handling, or network interactions. No hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or obfuscated code are present. The structure and content appear purely for defining constants for device control logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of enumeration definitions for a smart lighting system. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It serves as part of a larger application and contains no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
