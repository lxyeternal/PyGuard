{
  "purpose": "Define various enumerations for controlling and categorizing smart bulb behaviors and types.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading external input; the code defines enum classes only.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or input/output operations present.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or hidden logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions for different bulb-related concepts, with descriptive comments. There are no input sources, external data handling, or risky operations such as network communication, file access, or environment variable usage. The structure is straightforward, and the code appears to serve as part of a larger project without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely definitional, establishing enumerations for bulb control features. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present. It is standard, well-structured code without any suspicious elements.",
