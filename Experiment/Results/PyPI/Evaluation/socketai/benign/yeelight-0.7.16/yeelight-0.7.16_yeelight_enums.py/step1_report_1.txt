  "purpose": "Definition of enumerations for controlling and identifying types of lights, scenes, and power modes in a smart lighting system.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading operations are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing paths exist within this code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. The code consists solely of enum class definitions with descriptive comments.",
  "analysis": "The code provides enum class definitions to categorize various configurations for smart lighting control. There are no functions, data input/output, or logic that could be exploited. The code appears to be a standard implementation of enumerations used for device settings. No signs of malicious intent, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of enumeration definitions for a smart lighting system with no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or sensitive operations. Overall, the code is benign and safe.",
