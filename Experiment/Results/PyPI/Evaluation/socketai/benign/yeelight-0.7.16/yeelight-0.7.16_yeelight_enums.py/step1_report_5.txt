  "purpose": "Definition of various enumerations for controlling and configuring smart bulbs and scenes.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading sources; only enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static enum definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Enums are straightforward, and documentation is clear.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions used for categorizing different configurations and states of smart bulbs and scenes. There are no input handling, network operations, or data manipulations. No obfuscated or dynamic code is present. The code appears to be part of a larger project focused on device control. No malicious or suspicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of enum definitions for a smart bulb control project, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It is benign and purely declarative.",
