{
  "purpose": "Defines enumerations for smart lighting device states and configurations, serving as constants for controlling and identifying device behavior.",
  "sources": "Static enum class definitions; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions without data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, well-documented, and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions with descriptive comments, representing device types, modes, and scene classes. There are no functions, data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The code is static, human-readable, and standard for such configuration constants. No signs of obfuscation, malicious constructs, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The high confidence score (1) is justified given the clarity and simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as static configuration enums for a smart lighting system. It poses no security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The current assessments and scores are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
