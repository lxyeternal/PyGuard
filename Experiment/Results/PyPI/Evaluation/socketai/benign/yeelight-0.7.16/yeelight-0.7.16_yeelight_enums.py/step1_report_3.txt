{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations for various configurations and states related to smart lighting devices, such as power modes, bulb types, and scene classes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; all enums are statically defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or execute untrusted commands.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines static enums.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The enums are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises multiple Enum and IntEnum class definitions for different device configurations. There is no user input handling, network activity, or execution of external commands. All classes are static, and there are no dynamic evaluations or obfuscated parts. The structure is clear and conventional, representing device states and options.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of enumeration definitions related to smart lighting device configurations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks present.",
