  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to determine if the issues are present, identify any logical flaws, and evaluate the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The code consists solely of enum class definitions for various device states and configurations.\n- No data input/output, external communication, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The code appears straightforward, well-documented, and standard for such applications.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** None of the reports identify actual issues or vulnerabilities in the code. The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited.\n- **Malicious behavior or malware:** Zero in all reports, consistent with the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n- **Security risk:** None detected.\n\n### Scoring evaluation:\n- The reports assign:\n  - **malware:** 0 (appropriate)\n  - **obfuscated:** 0 (appropriate)\n  - **securityRisk:** 0 (appropriate)\n  - **confidence:** 1 (full confidence, as the code is straightforward)\n- These scores seem reasonable given the code content.\n\n### Logical or reasoning flaws:\n- No issues are identified in the reasoning; all reports correctly interpret the code as benign.\n- The conclusion that the code is safe and free of malicious intent is justified.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- Since the code is purely declarative, the risk scores could be slightly adjusted if one considers the broader context (e.g., if the code were part of a supply chain, even benign enums could be used maliciously if tampered with). However, based solely on this code snippet, the assessments are accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\nGiven the above, I agree with the reports' evaluations. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, straightforward, and poses no security threat based on the provided snippet. All scores are appropriate, and no further action is needed.",
