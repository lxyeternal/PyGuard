  "purpose": "Configuration script for a Django web application, setting up database, middleware, installed apps, and security settings.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., HUDSON_URL), imported optional modules (oauth_provider, provider, guardian), hardcoded SECRET_KEY and PASSWORD_HASHERS.",
  "sinks": "Not explicitly present; configuration values are mostly static or environment-based. No direct data sinks for untrusted input observed.",
  "flows": "No dynamic flow from untrusted sources to critical configuration; static settings are used. No evident malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of insecure password hashers such as MD5PasswordHasher and CryptPasswordHasher; hardcoded SECRET_KEY; permissive ALLOWED_HOSTS ('*'); optional modules imported without validation; no sanitization of environment variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a standard Django settings file with some optional modules loaded conditionally. The presence of insecure hash algorithms like MD5 and Crypt raises security concerns. The hardcoded SECRET_KEY, while common in development, could be problematic if used in production. The ALLOWED_HOSTS setting permits all hosts, increasing risk if deployed insecurely. Optional modules (oauth_provider, provider, guardian) are loaded without validation, but this alone isn't malicious. No evidence of malicious code or backdoors is present. The configuration does not include dangerous code injection, data exfiltration, or network communications typical of malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django settings configuration with some insecure practices (weak hashers, hardcoded secret). No malicious intent or malware is evident. Security risks are mostly related to deployment configuration rather than embedded malicious code.",
