  "purpose": "Django project configuration settings, primarily for development environment.",
  "sources": "Static configuration variables, environment variables (HUDSON_URL), conditional imports of optional modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no data leaks or external connections observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; configuration is static and straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "Use of insecure password hashers (MD5PasswordHasher, CryptPasswordHasher), hardcoded SECRET_KEY, DEBUG=True, ALLOWED_HOSTS=['*'], optional modules loaded without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django settings module with insecure practices typical of development environments. No malicious code, backdoors, or network exfiltration behaviors are present. The optional modules are imported conditionally, which is standard. The insecure hashers and hardcoded SECRET_KEY pose security risks but do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk around 0.2-0.4) are consistent with the code's nature. Overall, the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or supply chain compromise; the main issues are configuration weaknesses.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django configuration file with insecure practices suitable for development but not production. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
