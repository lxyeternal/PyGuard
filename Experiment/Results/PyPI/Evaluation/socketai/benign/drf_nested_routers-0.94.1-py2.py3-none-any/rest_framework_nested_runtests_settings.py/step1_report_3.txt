  "purpose": "Django project settings configuration for a web application.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (os.environ), imported modules, hardcoded strings (e.g., SECRET_KEY).",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported modules (e.g., oauth_provider, guardian) which may introduce security risks if misused, and environment variables.",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'HUDSON_URL' influences TEST_RUNNER settings; imported optional modules may enable additional features.",
  "anomalies": "Use of weak PASSWORD_HASHERS (e.g., MD5, Crypt), hardcoded SECRET_KEY, and enabling DEBUG mode in production settings. Optional modules are imported conditionally, but their presence is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of Django configuration settings, with environment variable checks for optional modules and settings. Notably, DEBUG is set to True, which is insecure for production. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded, which could be exploited if exposed. Password hashers include insecure algorithms like MD5 and Crypt, potentially weakening password security. The environment variable 'HUDSON_URL' influences test runner settings, indicating CI/CD integration. No malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network communications is present. Optional modules are imported conditionally, with no evidence of malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a standard settings file with some insecure configurations, but no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django settings module with insecure practices (e.g., DEBUG=True, hardcoded SECRET_KEY, weak hashers) but no evidence of malicious code, malware, or supply chain attacks. The presence of optional modules and environment variable usage are normal for configurable applications.",
