  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Findings:** Standard Django settings; optional modules loaded conditionally; insecure hashers (MD5, Crypt); hardcoded SECRET_KEY; ALLOWED_HOSTS='*'; no malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** No evidence of malicious activity; security issues are typical for development environments. The risk score of 0.3 seems appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** 0, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, straightforward code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8, reasonable given the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1; environment variable 'HUDSON_URL' influences test runner; optional modules conditionally imported; insecure hashers; hardcoded SECRET_KEY.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; configuration appears standard. Slightly higher confidence (0.9) due to detailed reasoning.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, reflecting insecure practices but no active threat.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar configuration; insecure hashers; DEBUG=True (insecure for production); hardcoded SECRET_KEY; environment variable influences test runner.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious code; insecure practices are typical in development settings. Risk score 0.4 seems appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same pattern; insecure hashers; hardcoded SECRET_KEY; optional modules loaded safely; no malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; security issues are typical for development. Risk score 0.3 is suitable.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Findings:** Same as above; insecure hashers; hardcoded SECRET_KEY; optional modules loaded conditionally; no malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; security concerns are typical for development configurations. Risk score 0.3 fits.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm the code is a standard Django settings file.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flow in any report.\n- **Insecure practices:** Use of weak hashers (MD5, Crypt), hardcoded SECRET_KEY, DEBUG=True in production (though not malicious), and permissive ALLOWED_HOSTS='*'. These are security concerns but not malicious.\n- **Optional modules:** Loaded conditionally, no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** None detected.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected).\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (code is straightforward).\n- **Risk score:** Given the insecure practices are typical in development but could be exploited if misconfigured, a moderate risk score of around **0.3** seems appropriate.\n\n### Additional notes:\n\n- The presence of insecure hashers and hardcoded SECRET_KEY are security weaknesses but not indicators of malicious intent.\n- The code does not exhibit any behavior typical of malware (network connections, data exfiltration, code injection, etc.).\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Score  | Justification                                               |\n|--------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware            | 0      | No malicious activity observed                               |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      | Code is clear and straightforward                            |\n| Security risk      | 0.3    | Insecure practices (weak hashers, hardcoded secrets, DEBUG=True) but typical in dev environments |\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more conservative or aggressive assessment, but based on the evidence, this is a balanced conclusion.",
