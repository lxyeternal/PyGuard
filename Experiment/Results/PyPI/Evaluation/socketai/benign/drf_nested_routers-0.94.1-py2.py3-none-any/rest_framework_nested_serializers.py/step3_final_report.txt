  "purpose": "Extension of Django REST Framework's HyperlinkedModelSerializer to support nested hyperlinked relationships with compound keys, replacing primary key relationships with URL links.",
  "sources": "Import statements for DRF serializers, Django models, and optional get_nested_relation_kwargs; class methods accessing relation info and building URL/nested fields.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; no network calls, data exfiltration, or insecure URL handling detected.",
  "flows": "The serializer methods pass relation info and kwargs to URL fields and nested serializers, but no malicious or suspicious data flow is present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of optional import with try-except; dynamic class creation for nested serializers; no suspicious code or obfuscation; no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard extension of DRF serializers for nested hyperlinked relationships. It handles optional imports safely, creates nested serializers dynamically, and injects parent lookup kwargs into URL fields. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The code relies on standard DRF and Django patterns, with no network activity or data leaks. The low security risk and malware scores are justified, reflecting the benign, configuration-oriented nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured extension of DRF serializers supporting nested hyperlinked models. No malicious, obfuscated, or suspicious behavior is detected. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
