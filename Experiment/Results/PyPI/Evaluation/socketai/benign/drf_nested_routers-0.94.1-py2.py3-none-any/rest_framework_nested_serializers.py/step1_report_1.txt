  "purpose": "Define a custom serializer for Django REST Framework that supports nested hyperlinked relationships with compound keys.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute definitions, method parameters, and dynamic class creation.",
  "sinks": "Super calls to build_url_field, get_nested_relation_kwargs, and dynamic class attributes.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., parent_lookup_kwargs) flows into build_url_field and build_nested_field, influencing URL construction and relation handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious dynamic code execution detected. The code primarily utilizes standard DRF and Django features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a specialized serializer extending DRF's HyperlinkedModelSerializer. It customizes URL field building and nested relation serialization, leveraging existing DRF classes and methods. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is consistent with standard DRF patterns and includes no suspicious or anomalous code segments. The use of try-except around import indicates compatibility handling, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, well-structured extension of DRF serializers for nested hyperlinked relationships. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The overall security risk is low.",
