  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured extension of DRF's nested hyperlinked fields, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified, and malware score remains at 0. All reports are consistent with this assessment. No modifications are necessary."
