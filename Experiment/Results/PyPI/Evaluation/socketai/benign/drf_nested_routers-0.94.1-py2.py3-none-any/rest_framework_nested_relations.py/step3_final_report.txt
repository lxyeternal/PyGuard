  "purpose": "Defines custom nested hyperlinked serializer fields for Django REST Framework to handle model relationships with URL hyperlinks, supporting multi-level lookups.",
  "sources": "Model instances, URL parameters, request objects, class attributes, and object attributes used during URL generation and object retrieval.",
  "sinks": "URL reversing functions and database query methods (`get()`) that process untrusted input data from URL parameters or object attributes.",
  "flows": "Input data from URL parameters or object attributes flows into URL generation (`get_url`) and object lookup (`get_object`) methods, influencing URL construction and database queries.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected. Use of `reduce()` for nested attribute access is standard. Exception handling is appropriate.",
  "analysis": "The code extends DRF's HyperlinkedRelatedField to support nested URL lookups, handling multi-level relationships via configurable `parent_lookup_kwargs`. It safely constructs URLs and retrieves objects with proper exception handling. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code relies on standard Django ORM and DRF practices, with exception handling to mitigate invalid or malicious inputs. The potential security concern is if untrusted data influences URL or database queries, but the code manages this through exception handling and standard patterns. Overall, the implementation is sound and secure for typical use cases.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured extension of DRF's nested hyperlinked fields, with no malicious or obfuscated behavior. The low security risk score (0.2) is justified, and malware score remains at 0. All reports are consistent with this assessment. No modifications are necessary.",
