{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with no explicitly defined purpose in the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the user via input() function and reads environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Uses environment variables and potentially writes data to a network socket or file, depending on unshown parts of the code.",
  "flows": "Input received from user and environment variables may flow into network or file operations (not fully shown).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscation; no unusual dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal and standard. It reads user input and environment variables, which are typical sources. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The lack of context limits certainty, but based on visible code, no malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. It uses standard input and environment variables without suspicious patterns. Due to limited code provided, confidence remains high in the benign assessment.",
