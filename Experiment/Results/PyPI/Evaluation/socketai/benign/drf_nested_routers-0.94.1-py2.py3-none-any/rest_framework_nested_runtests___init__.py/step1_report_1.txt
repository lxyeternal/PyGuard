  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a Python module that could perform various functions depending on how it is used.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, imported modules, and possibly user input via function parameters or external inputs if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or data processing functions. Specific sinks are not explicitly shown in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs to sinks like network or file operations, if they exist. Due to the absence of explicit code, detailed flow analysis is limited.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs are observed. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is examined for malicious patterns including data leaks, malicious network activity, or backdoors. No suspicious patterns are identified in the provided code snippet. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard, with no signs of malicious behavior. The code structure is clear, and no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present. The lack of specific functions or network operations limits the depth of analysis, but based on what is available, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to perform its intended functions without malicious intent. However, without full context or execution environment details, this assessment is based solely on the visible code.",
