  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, dynamic imports, file I/O, data processing functions, user input handling.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage via environment variables, network connections (if present), file system access.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) to processing functions, possibly to external connections or data storage.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports, environment variables, minimal code structure, no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious functions. Dynamic imports and environment variables are noted but not evidenced to be malicious. The code's benign nature is consistent across reports, with no red flags for malware or security risks. The confidence in benign assessment is high, and no anomalies suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is benign with minimal security concern. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
