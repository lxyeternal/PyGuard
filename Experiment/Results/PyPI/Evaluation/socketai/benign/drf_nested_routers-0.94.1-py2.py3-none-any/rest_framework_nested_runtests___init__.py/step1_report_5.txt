{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script performing basic file operations and possibly data processing.",
  "sources": "Input data from file reads, potentially from user input or external files.",
  "sinks": "Writing data back to files, or displaying output via print statements.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (files/user input) to processing functions and then to sinks (files or console output).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs detected. The code is straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file I/O operations and data processing without any signs of malicious behavior. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or code injection patterns are evident. Usage of third-party libraries is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code is present. The flow from data source to sink is typical for a data processing script.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the code content, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The script appears to be a normal utility program without any malicious intent.",
