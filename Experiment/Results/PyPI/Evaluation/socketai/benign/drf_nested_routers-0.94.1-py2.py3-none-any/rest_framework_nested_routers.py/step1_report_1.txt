  "purpose": "Defines nested routing classes for Django REST Framework to enable nested resource URLs.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, re, and typing; class initializations; regex compilation; class attributes and methods; route and URL string manipulations.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no direct data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Code initializes nested router classes, processes route URLs by replacing and formatting strings, and validates identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected. Use of regex for identifier validation appears standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements nested router classes for Django REST Framework, focusing on URL pattern generation and validation of lookup names. It imports standard modules, uses regex to validate identifiers, and manipulates URL strings. The class methods handle router nesting logic and URL pattern adjustments. There are no signs of malicious data handling, network activity, or code injection. Overall, the code appears to be a typical routing utility with standard validation and string processing, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for nested routing in DRF, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It mainly handles URL pattern creation and validation, following common patterns without suspicious modifications.",
