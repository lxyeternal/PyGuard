  "purpose": "Provides nested routing classes for Django REST Framework, enabling URL pattern generation and validation for nested resources.",
  "sources": "URL pattern strings, regex validation for lookup names, class attributes for URL construction, parent router registry data.",
  "sinks": "URL pattern strings used in route definitions, regex validation functions, class inheritance structures.",
  "flows": "Lookup name validation flows into URL pattern creation; parent router registry data flows into nested route URL assembly.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad try-except in __init__ methods which could mask errors; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines nested router classes for DRF, validating lookup names with regex, manipulating URL strings for nested routes, and inheriting from standard DRF router classes. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The broad exception handling is a minor code quality concern but does not introduce security risks. The URL patterns are constructed from trusted inputs, and no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate implementation of nested routers for Django REST Framework. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The low malware score (0.0) and risk score (~0.1) are justified. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal.",
