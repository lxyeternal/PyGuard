  "purpose": "This code provides metadata for a Python package, including licensing information, authorship, and versioning.",
  "sources": "The code sources include comments and module-level variables (__version__). No input or external data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs related to untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code consists solely of comments and a version variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains standard license comments and a version declaration, which are typical and not suspicious. No unusual or obfuscated code is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely metadata with no executable logic beyond setting a version variable. It contains licensing comments and author attribution. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior are observed. There is no indication of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard header for a Python package with no malicious or security concerns. The code serves only to document licensing and version info.",
