  "purpose": "This code provides licensing information and a version identifier for the package, serving as metadata rather than executable logic.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment (__version__ = '0.94.1') and licensing comments.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is static metadata with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains only licensing comments and a version string, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static metadata, consisting of licensing comments and a version assignment. There are no executable functions, data flows, or dynamic behaviors. The code is standard for open-source packages and does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of this snippet, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0 with high confidence. No anomalies or signs of malicious intent are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard license header and version indicator with no malicious or security concerns. The existing assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
