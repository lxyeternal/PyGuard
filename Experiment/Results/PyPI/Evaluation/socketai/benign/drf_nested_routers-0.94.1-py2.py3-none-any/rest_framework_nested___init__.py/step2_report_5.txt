  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code carefully.\n\n1. **Code Content & Nature**:\n   - The code consists solely of licensing comments, copyright notices, and a version string assignment (`__version__ = '0.94.1'`).\n   - There are no functions, data input/output, network calls, or executable logic.\n   - The code is static metadata, typical for package headers or module-level documentation.\n\n2. **Assessment of Malicious Indicators**:\n   - No source-to-sink data flows, no untrusted data processing, and no suspicious code structures.\n   - No obfuscation, embedded payloads, or code patterns indicative of malware.\n   - The code is standard practice in open-source projects to include licensing info and versioning.\n\n3. **Scores and Reasoning**:\n   - **Malware Score**: All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**: All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code is straightforward and clear.\n   - **Risk Score**: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate since there's no evidence of security risk.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Flaws in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify this as benign metadata.\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities or malicious intent beyond what the code shows.\n   - The reasoning is sound: static comments and a version variable are not malicious.\n\n5. **Any Recommendations for Score Adjustments?**\n   - The scores seem appropriate and reasonable. There's no need to increase any scores.\n\n6. **Overall Justification**:\n   - The code is a standard license header and version declaration, with no dynamic or executable components.\n   - No indicators of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.\n\n**Final Assessment**:\n- **Malware Score**: 0\n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0\n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis aligns with the current reports and the code's nature.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and poses no security risk. The scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
