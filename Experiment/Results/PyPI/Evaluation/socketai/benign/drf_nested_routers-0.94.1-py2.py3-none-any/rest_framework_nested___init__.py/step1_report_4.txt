  "purpose": "This code appears to be a licensing and version declaration, likely part of a larger Python project or package.",
  "sources": "The source is the license comment block and the version assignment (__version__ = '0.94.1').",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is processed or can lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input, or output operations observed in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a standard license header and version assignment; no anomalies or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments detailing licensing information and a version string assignment. There are no functions, data processing, or other executable statements. The license text is standard and does not contain any embedded malicious code or obfuscated content. The version variable is a simple string assignment. No external data sources or sinks are involved. The absence of any dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling indicates no malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard license header with a version number. It shows no signs of malware, suspicious behavior, or security issues. The code is straightforward and safe.",
