  "purpose": "Manage a debug configuration flag based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads 'args.debug' from an external Namespace object.",
  "sinks": "Sets 'settings.debug' attribute; no external data sinks or leaks involved.",
  "flows": "Input 'args.debug' -> 'settings.debug' via 'init_settings' function.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward attribute assignment with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Settings class with a boolean attribute 'debug'. It creates a global instance and provides a function to update this attribute based on an external argument. The logic is simple, with no external I/O, network calls, or data leaks. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code's purpose is purely configuration management. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward configuration handler with no malicious or suspicious elements. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
