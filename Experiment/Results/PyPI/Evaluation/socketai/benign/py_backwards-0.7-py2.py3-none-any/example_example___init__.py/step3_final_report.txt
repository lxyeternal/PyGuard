  "purpose": "The code outputs the number 10 to standard output.",
  "sources": "The print statement `print(10)` as the primary source of data output.",
  "sinks": "Standard output (console) where the number 10 is printed.",
  "flows": "The source (print statement) directly outputs to the sink (console). No external data or untrusted input involved.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; code is straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple print statement with no inputs, external data, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and harmlessness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No adjustments are necessary.",
