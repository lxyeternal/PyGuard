{
  "purpose": "Test function that verifies the output of 'get_something' from 'example.main' module.",
  "sources": "Input string 'new' passed to 'get_something' function.",
  "sinks": "Comparison operation within the assert statement; no direct data leak or system impact.",
  "flows": "Input 'new' flows into 'get_something' and its output is compared against a string.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns observed. The code is straightforward test code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then defines a test function that asserts the output of 'get_something' when given 'new'. The code's structure indicates a standard unit test. No malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The reliance on an external function 'get_something' is typical for testing purposes; without inspecting that function, no malicious behavior can be inferred. The code is minimal and standard for testing, with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign test case for a function. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
