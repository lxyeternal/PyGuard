  "purpose": "Unit test for the function get_something imported from example.main",
  "sources": "Input 'new' passed to get_something() function within test_get_something()",
  "sinks": "Comparison operation in assert statement; no other data sinks identified",
  "flows": "Input 'new' flows into get_something() and its output flows to the assert comparison",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future statements to ensure compatibility and defines a simple test function that asserts the output of get_something('new') equals 'something new'. The code appears to be a standard unit test with no suspicious or malicious behavior. No data leaks, unsafe operations, or malicious code execution identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward unit test with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It tests a function from an external module, which is common practice. No vulnerabilities or malicious activity detected.",
