  "purpose": "A simple unit test that verifies the output of the function get_something when passed the argument 'new'.",
  "sources": "The input argument 'new' passed to get_something()",
  "sinks": "The assertion comparing the output of get_something('new') to 'something new'",
  "flows": "Input 'new' -> get_something() -> assertion check",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test importing get_something from an external module and asserting its output. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or obfuscation are present. The external function's implementation is unknown, but the test itself is benign. The reports correctly identify the code as safe, with malware and obfuscation scores of 0, and a very low security risk score. The confidence in benignity is high, and no anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The scores should be malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, consistent with the reports and analysis.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
