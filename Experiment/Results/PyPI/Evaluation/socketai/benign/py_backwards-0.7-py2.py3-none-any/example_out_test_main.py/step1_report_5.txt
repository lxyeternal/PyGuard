  "purpose": "Unit test function to verify the behavior of get_something() from example.main",
  "sources": "Import statement from example.main import get_something",
  "sinks": "None directly; no data output or network calls within this snippet",
  "flows": "Input 'new' flows into get_something() and checks its return value",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is a simple test case with standard imports",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then defines a test function that asserts the output of get_something() with input 'new' equals 'something new'. The function is a straightforward unit test, with no suspicious code, data leakage, or malicious behavior evident. The import is from a local module, and there are no hidden or obfuscated elements. No external or untrusted data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
