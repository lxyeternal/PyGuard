  "sources": "Import statement importing get_something from example.main",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data output or external communication present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; simple function call and assertion",
  "anomalies": "Use of future imports is standard and not suspicious; no unusual or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then defines a test function that asserts the output of get_something with a specific input. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious operations. The code is a straightforward unit test snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test for the function get_something, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
