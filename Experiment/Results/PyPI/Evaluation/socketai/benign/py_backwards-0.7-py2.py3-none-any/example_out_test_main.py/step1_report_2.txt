{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple test function for the get_something function imported from example.main, likely for verifying expected output.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the parameter passed to get_something, which is 'new'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data is written or sent to external systems, nor are there any outputs beyond the test assertion.",
  "flows": "Input 'new' flows into get_something, and its output is compared in the assertion.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code structures are present. The imported function's implementation is not shown, but the test itself is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then defines a test function that asserts get_something('new') equals 'something new'. There are no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors. The code is a standard unit test without any apparent malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign test script that verifies the behavior of an external function. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
