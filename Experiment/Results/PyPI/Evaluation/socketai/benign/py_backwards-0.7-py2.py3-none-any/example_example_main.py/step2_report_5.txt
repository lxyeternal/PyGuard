  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content**:\n   The provided code is a simple function:\n   ```python\n   def get_something(what: str) -> str:\n       return f'something {what}'\n   ```\n   It takes a string input and returns a formatted string that includes that input.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - All reports agree that the code is straightforward, with no external data reads, no obfuscation, no suspicious operations, and no malicious intent.\n   - No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, network activity, or dynamic code execution are observed.\n   - The code is benign, simple, and safe.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly identify the code as benign, with no security issues.\n   - No logical errors or reasoning flaws are apparent.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n     - `confidence`: 1\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious features.\n   - The `malware` score of 0 is justified; no malicious activity is present.\n   - The `obfuscated` score of 0 is justified; the code is clear and straightforward.\n   - The `securityRisk` score of 0 is justified; no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors are detected.\n\n5. **Potential Discrepancies or Unreasonable Scores**:\n   - No scores seem unreasonable; all are consistent with the code's nature.\n   - The reports do not overstate any risk or malicious potential.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**:\n   - Since the code is trivial, the risk of hidden malicious behavior is extremely low.\n   - No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are justified here, as the code is transparent.\n\n7. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - Based on the code and reports, the scores are appropriate.\n   - I would maintain the current scores.\n\n8. **My Final Estimates**:\n   - **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n   - **Obfuscated score**: 0 (code is clear)\n   - **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary**: The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports correctly reflect this, and the scores are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
