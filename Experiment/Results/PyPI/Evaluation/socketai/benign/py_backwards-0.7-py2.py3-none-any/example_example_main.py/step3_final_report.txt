  "purpose": "A simple string formatting function that returns a string incorporating the input parameter.",
  "sources": "The function reads the input parameter 'what' when called.",
  "sinks": "The input 'what' is used directly in string formatting; no external data sources or outputs are involved that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Input 'what' flows directly into the return statement without any transformation or external processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and simple.",
  "analysis": "The code is a trivial function that concatenates a string with the input parameter. All reports agree on its benign nature, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and safety. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications to scores or analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
