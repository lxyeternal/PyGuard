{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs data processing or utility functions. No explicit purpose of malicious activity is evident.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly defined; the code does not read external input, environment variables, or network data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that handle untrusted data, perform network operations, or write to sensitive locations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observed; the code mainly executes internal computations or definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code structures are detected. No obfuscation or complex dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard function definitions, variable assignments, and possibly some straightforward logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system modifications. Usage of third-party libraries is minimal or typical. No code injections or insecure practices are identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign and safe for use.",
