  "sinks": "No data sinks or operations that could leak data or perform unsafe actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code executes a static print statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script only contains a print statement with a static message. It neither reads external input nor writes data elsewhere. There are no functions, no network calls, no environment variable uses, and no complex logic. Given the simplicity, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be a simple, harmless script.",
