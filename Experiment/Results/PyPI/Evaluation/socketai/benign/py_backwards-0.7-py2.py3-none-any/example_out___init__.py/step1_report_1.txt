  "purpose": "The provided code is only importing future features to ensure compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in these import statements.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or potentially dangerous operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are established as there are only import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements for future features, which is standard practice for compatibility and not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports features from __future__ to enable compatibility across Python versions, specifically absolute_import, division, and print_function. These are common and harmless, serving to modify language behavior for consistent syntax and semantics. There are no signs of malicious intent, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors. The code is minimal and does not perform any operations beyond these imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, solely importing future features to ensure compatibility. There are no indications of malicious activity or security risks.",
