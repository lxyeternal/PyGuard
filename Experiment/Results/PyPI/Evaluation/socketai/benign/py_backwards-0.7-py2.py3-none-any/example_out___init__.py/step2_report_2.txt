  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and assess the validity of their conclusions, the scores assigned, and whether the logic holds up.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code in question consists solely of import statements from `__future__`, which are standard in Python 2/3 compatibility code.\n- No data input/output, network activity, or executable logic is present.\n- The code is minimal and serves a compatibility purpose, which is common and benign.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code only imports future features for compatibility. No suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate. The logic is sound, and the conclusion is correct. The score aligns with the benign nature.\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, only import statements, no data or logic.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues here.\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, only future import statements for compatibility.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Valid. No concerns.\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar, only future imports, no data or logic.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, minimal compatibility boilerplate.\n- **Scores:** confidence=1, obfuscated=0, malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation:**\n\n- **Code presence:** The code snippets are only importing `__future__` features. No data, no logic, no external dependencies.\n- **Malware or malicious activity:** None detected. The code is purely for compatibility.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Security risk:** Zero, as there are no operations or data handling.\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The malware score should remain at 0 across all reports.\n- The obfuscated score remains at 0.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, given the lack of any malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 or 0.2 at most, considering it's just compatibility boilerplate but still minimal risk.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No security concerns arise from these snippets.",
