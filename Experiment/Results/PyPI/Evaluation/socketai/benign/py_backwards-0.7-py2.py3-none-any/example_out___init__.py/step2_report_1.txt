  "review": "Let's review each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as only importing __future__ features for Python 2/3 compatibility.\n- No data input, output, or processing is present.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behavior, or malicious indicators are identified.\n- The code is minimal and standard for compatibility purposes.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n\n- The code snippets are consistent across reports.\n- No evidence of obfuscation, malware, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the code.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n\n- The reports uniformly assign maximum confidence (1) and zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, which aligns with the analysis.\n- No changes needed in scoring or reasoning.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n\n- The reports correctly assume that import statements alone, especially for __future__, are benign.\n- No hidden malicious behavior or data flows are implied or suggested.\n\n**Final evaluation:**\n\n- The code is benign, standard boilerplate for compatibility.\n- No security concerns or malicious activity are present.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (correctly identified as benign)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (correctly identified as straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is a benign compatibility snippet with no security implications. No adjustments are necessary.",
