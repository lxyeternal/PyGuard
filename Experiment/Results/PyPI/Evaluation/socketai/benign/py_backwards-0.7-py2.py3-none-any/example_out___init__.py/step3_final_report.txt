  "purpose": "Minimal Python compatibility boilerplate using __future__ imports for Python 2/3 interoperability.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__ for absolute_import, division, and print_function.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process data, input/output, or execute logic.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only static import statements with no data or control flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of __future__ import statements, which are used to ensure compatibility between Python 2 and 3. There are no data inputs, outputs, network activity, or executable logic. All reports correctly identify the benign and standard nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the simplicity and purpose of the code. No suspicious behavior, obfuscation, or malicious intent is present. The code does not read or write data, perform network operations, or contain any vulnerabilities. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), and the code is clearly non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as a compatibility boilerplate with no security risks or malicious behavior. All reports accurately reflect this, and no adjustments to scores are necessary.",
