{
  "purpose": "The code imports future features to ensure compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3, typically used to standardize behavior across different Python versions.",
  "sources": "There are no input or data reading sources in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points or untrusted data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains future import statements with no additional logic, which is standard practice and not unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of future import statements for absolute_import, division, and print_function. These are common in Python 2/3 compatibility code and do not pose security risks or indicate malicious intent. There are no other code segments, data handling, or operations to analyze.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard compatibility boilerplate for Python 2/3 projects and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
