  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation:**\n   - The code snippet consists solely of three `from __future__ import ...` statements:\n     ```python\n     from __future__ import absolute_import\n     from __future__ import division\n     from __future__ import print_function\n     ```\n   - There are no other code elements, data inputs, outputs, or operations.\n\n2. **Assessment of Report Validity:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that these are standard `__future__` imports used for Python 2/3 compatibility.\n   - They correctly note the absence of data flows, sinks, or malicious activity.\n   - The reasoning in each report aligns with the minimal nature of the code.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - No errors or logical flaws are evident. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n   - They do not overstate the security implications; they correctly classify the code as benign.\n\n4. **Score Justification:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign `0`, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign `0`, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** All reports assign `0`, which is justified because the code performs no operations beyond imports.\n\n5. **Potential Risks or Assumptions:**\n   - Since the code is only import statements, there are no assumptions about vulnerabilities.\n   - No suspicious behavior or indicators of malicious intent are present.\n\n6. **Overall Consistency and Reasonableness of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's content.\n   - No adjustments are necessary.\n\n7. **Additional Expert Judgment:**\n   - Given the code's simplicity, the scores reflect a low to zero risk.\n   - The confidence level is high (`1`) across all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n**Final Expert Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — The code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risk present.\n\n**Summary:**\nAll reports are accurate and reasonable. The code is benign, standard boilerplate for compatibility, and poses no security concerns. The scores are justified and should remain as they are.",
