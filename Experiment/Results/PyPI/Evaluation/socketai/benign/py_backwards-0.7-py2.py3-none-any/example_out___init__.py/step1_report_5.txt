  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are referenced in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to a leak or effect, as no executable code or data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of future import statements with no additional logic, which is unusual but not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The snippet only contains future import statements for compatibility across Python versions. There is no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. It is a minimal setup code segment often used at the beginning of Python scripts to ensure certain features are available consistently.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to import future features for compatibility purposes. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
