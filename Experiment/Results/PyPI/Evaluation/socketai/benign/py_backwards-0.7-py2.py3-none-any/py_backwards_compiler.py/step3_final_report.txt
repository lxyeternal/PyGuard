{
  "purpose": "This code reads Python source files, parses them into ASTs, applies a sequence of transformers based on target levels, and writes the transformed code back to files while collecting dependencies. It functions as a static code transformation and compilation pipeline.",
  "sources": "Reads input files via file.open(), parses code with ast.parse, and reads dependencies during transformations.",
  "sinks": "Writes transformed code to output files; no untrusted data is executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input files -> parse into AST -> apply transformers -> unparse AST -> fix code -> write output files; dependencies are collected during transformation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected. Uses external transformers without details; potential external risk if transformers are malicious, but core code is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static file reading, AST parsing, transformation via external modules, and file writing with exception handling. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or environment manipulation is present. Transformers are external and unspecified, but the core logic is straightforward and secure. No obfuscation or malicious code patterns are evident. The use of deep copies and exception handling indicates robustness. Overall, the code is a standard static transformation pipeline with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured static code transformation utility. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The low malware score (0), zero obfuscation (0), and low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
