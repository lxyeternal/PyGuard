  "purpose": "The code is designed to parse, transform, and compile Python source files, applying a series of transformations, and saving the results.",
  "sources": "Code reads input files from a specified path and reads their contents via input.open()",
  "sinks": "Code writes transformed code to output files via output.open('w')",
  "flows": "Input files -> read content -> transform AST -> unparse to code -> write to output files",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles file I/O, AST transformations, and code formatting. It employs a set of transformers to modify the AST based on target parameters. It uses safe libraries for parsing and unparse operations. There are no suspicious network connections, no hardcoded secrets, or other malicious behavior. The exception handling is standard for code transformation workflows. The flow of data is straightforward: reading source code, transforming it, and saving output. No embedded or hidden malicious logic was detected. The code does not perform any data exfiltration or suspicious system commands.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a legitimate code transformation and compilation utility with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior.",
