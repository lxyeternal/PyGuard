{
  "purpose": "The function get_something constructs and returns a string that includes the input parameter, likely for display or logging purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'what' of the function get_something",
  "sinks": "Return statement of get_something, which outputs a string containing the input",
  "flows": "Input 'what' flows into string formatting, which is then joined and returned",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior; only standard string formatting and future imports",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, defines a function that concatenates a fixed string with the input 'what' using string formatting, then joins and returns it. There are no external data sources, no untrusted data flows leading to sensitive operations, and no suspicious or malicious code patterns. The code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a basic string generator with no suspicious elements.",
