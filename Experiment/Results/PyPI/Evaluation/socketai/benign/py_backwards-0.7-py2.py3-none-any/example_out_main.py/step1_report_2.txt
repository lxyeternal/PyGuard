{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate a string that combines a static phrase with a provided input.",
  "sources": "The function get_something reads the input parameter 'what'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output data to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input 'what' flows into the string formatting within get_something, resulting in concatenated string output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features, likely for compatibility. It defines a single function that constructs a string from a fixed phrase and a parameter. There are no external data sources, network connections, or system modifications. The implementation is straightforward and appears benign. No suspicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It merely concatenates a string with the input parameter without any malicious logic.",
