  "purpose": "A simple function concatenating 'something ' with the string representation of the input parameter 'what'.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'what' received by the function get_something.",
  "sinks": "The string returned by the function, used as output; no external data or system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input 'what' flows into string formatting and joining, then returns the concatenated string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward string concatenation with no obfuscation, external calls, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that concatenates a static string with a formatted version of the input. It uses safe string formatting and joining, with no external dependencies, network calls, or malicious patterns. The use of future imports is standard for compatibility and does not indicate malicious intent. The function performs a benign string operation with no side effects or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple string concatenation without any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All signals indicate a safe, straightforward implementation.",
