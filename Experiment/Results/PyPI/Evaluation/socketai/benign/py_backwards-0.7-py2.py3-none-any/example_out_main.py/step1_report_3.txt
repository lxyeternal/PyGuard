  "purpose": "Function to generate a string with a prefix and a given input",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'what' of the function get_something",
  "sinks": "Return statement which outputs the concatenated string",
  "flows": "Input 'what' flows into the string formatting within get_something, then to the return statement",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious imports beyond future statements, no dynamic code execution or obfuscation, no external network calls or system modifications",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements for future compatibility and a single function that concatenates a static string with a parameter. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The function appears straightforward, returning a formatted string. The presence of future imports is standard for compatibility and does not indicate malicious intent. The code does not perform any external actions or access sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign function with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and standard in nature.",
