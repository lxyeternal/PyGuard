  "purpose": "The function constructs and returns a string combining a fixed phrase with an input parameter.",
  "sources": "The function receives 'what' as input parameter.",
  "sinks": "The input 'what' is formatted into a string, but no further processing or data leak occurs.",
  "flows": "Input 'what' flows into string formatting, then is returned as part of a concatenated string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, defines a single function that concatenates a fixed string with a user-provided input, and returns the result. There are no suspicious behaviors such as network calls, data exfiltration, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The function simply performs string formatting and concatenation without side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple string manipulation with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
