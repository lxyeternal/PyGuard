  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a straightforward unit test importing `get_something` from `example.main`.\n- The code only performs a function call with a hardcoded input `'new'` and asserts the output.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or suspicious patterns are mentioned.\n- All reports assign maximum confidence (1) and zero scores for obfuscation, malware, and security risk.\n- The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in code:** No issues are present. The code is simple, standard testing code.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None detected. The reports agree on this.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are indicated or implied.\n\n### Flaws or logical errors:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; no flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n- The code is straightforward, and the analysis correctly identifies it as benign.\n\n### Scores:\n- The **malware** score is 0 in all reports, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- The **obfuscated** score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- The **securityRisk** score is 0, which is appropriate given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent.\n\n### Potential concerns:\n- Since the code is a simple test, the only potential risk would be if `get_something` itself is malicious or compromised. However, the reports focus solely on the test code, not the dependency's integrity.\n- Without analyzing the actual implementation of `get_something`, we cannot assess its safety. But given the context, the test code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.0 (no security risk)\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is a standard unit test with no malicious patterns, obfuscation, or external data handling.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No reason exists to assign higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nBased on the provided reports and code, **the overall malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0**. The code is benign, and the reports correctly reflect that.\n\n**Final recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to evaluate the actual implementation of `get_something` or consider other aspects.",
