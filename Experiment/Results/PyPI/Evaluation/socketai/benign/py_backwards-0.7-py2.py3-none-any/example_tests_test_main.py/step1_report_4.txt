{
  "purpose": "The code defines a test function to verify the output of the 'get_something' function from the 'example.main' module.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the function argument 'new' passed to 'get_something'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Input 'new' flows into 'get_something', and the output is compared to a string, with no further data flow or external interaction.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior. It appears to be a simple test case.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function from an external module and tests its return value. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. The structure is typical for a unit test, with no external data sources, sinks, or complex control flows.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple unit test verifying a function's output. There are no indicators of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears safe and benign.",
