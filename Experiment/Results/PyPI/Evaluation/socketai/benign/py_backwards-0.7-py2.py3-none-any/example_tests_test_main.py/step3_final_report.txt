  "purpose": "A simple unit test verifying the output of get_something with a fixed input.",
  "sources": "Import statement from example.main, calling get_something('new')",
  "sinks": "None identified; no external data or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "Input 'new' flows through get_something to produce output; no external sinks or data leaks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test function importing get_something and asserting its output for a specific input. It contains no obfuscation, malicious code, or external data handling. All reports agree on its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns support the conclusion that it is safe and free of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard unit test with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
