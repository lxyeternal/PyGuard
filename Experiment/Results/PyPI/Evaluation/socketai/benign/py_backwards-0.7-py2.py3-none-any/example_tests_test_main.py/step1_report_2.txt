  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data output or external data handling",
  "flows": "N/A - No data flows or processing within this snippet",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward test case with no suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function and defines a test that asserts its output for a given input. There are no indications of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The function 'get_something' is external and from a seemingly harmless module. No hardcoded credentials, network operations, or obfuscated code are present. It is a typical unit test pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple unit test for an imported function with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. No suspicious behavior detected.",
