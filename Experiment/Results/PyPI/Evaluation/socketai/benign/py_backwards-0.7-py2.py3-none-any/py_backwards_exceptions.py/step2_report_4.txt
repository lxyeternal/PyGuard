  "review": "Let's systematically analyze the provided code and reports:\n\n1. **Code Content & Functionality:**\n   - The code defines several custom exception classes for error handling related to compilation, transformation, and input validation.\n   - It uses `TYPE_CHECKING` to conditionally import `BaseTransformer` for type hints, which is a standard pattern.\n   - The exception classes have straightforward constructors that assign attributes, with descriptive docstrings.\n   - There are no dynamic code executions, external data reads, network calls, or any runtime behaviors that could be malicious.\n   - The code is static and purely for error management within a larger system.\n\n2. **Security and Malicious Behavior:**\n   - No signs of obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets.\n   - No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.\n   - No external dependencies or network activity.\n   - The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` is standard and does not impact runtime security.\n   - The code does not process or handle any user input or external data.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious activity detected.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — Clear, straightforward code.\n   - **Risk Score:** 0 — No security risks identified; the code is purely for error handling.\n\n4. **Any Issues or Inconsistencies:**\n   - The reports uniformly identify the code as standard, safe, and without security concerns.\n   - The reasoning in each report aligns with the actual code content.\n   - No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; all analyses are consistent.\n\n**Summary & Final Assessment:**\n\n- The code is a well-structured, standard set of custom exception classes.\n- There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores assigned in the reports (all zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk) are appropriate and justified.\n- Given the static nature and purpose of the code, higher risk or malware scores are unwarranted.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and comprehensive. The code is safe, standard, and free of security concerns.",
