  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for a transformation or compilation process.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; class and method definitions only.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code consists solely of class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a set of custom exception classes for error handling related to compilation, transformation, and input validation. It imports 'Type' and 'TYPE_CHECKING' for type hinting, and defines exceptions with descriptive docstrings. The code is static, with no dynamic code execution, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. It appears to be standard, well-structured code intended for error management.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious activities, and no security risks. It is straightforward, with no signs of supply chain or security concerns.",
