  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a compilation and transformation process.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; exception classes do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; the use of TYPE_CHECKING and class definitions are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no dynamic code execution, input reading, network activity, or data handling that could be exploited maliciously. The use of 'TYPE_CHECKING' is standard for type hints and does not introduce security concerns. There are no hardcoded secrets, no code injection points, and no external interactions. The code appears straightforward, designed for error handling in a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of standard custom exception classes for managing errors. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
