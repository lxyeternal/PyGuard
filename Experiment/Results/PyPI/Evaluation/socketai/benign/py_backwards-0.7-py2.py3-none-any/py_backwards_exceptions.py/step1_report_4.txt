  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling related to compilation, transformation, and input validation.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only class and exception definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; code only defines exceptions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; no flow present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious patterns observed; standard exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports TYPE_CHECKING for type hints, which is safe. It defines several custom exceptions with clear docstrings. No user input, network operations, file handling, or dynamic code execution present. The class constructors simply assign attributes without any logic that could be malicious. The code structure is standard for defining exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of exception class definitions for error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no security risks detected. It appears to be part of a larger application and is purely for defining custom errors.",
