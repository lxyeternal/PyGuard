  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is solely defining custom exception classes.\n   - There are no indications of malicious code, obfuscation, or dynamic behavior.\n   - The code is static, with no external data handling, network activity, or code execution.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the use of `TYPE_CHECKING` for type hints and that no security concerns arise from this pattern.\n   - No logical errors or security flaws are identified in the reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - Obfuscated score is 0, which is correct.\n   - Security risk scores are 0, aligning with the analysis.\n   - The confidence levels are all 1, which is justified due to the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since no malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present, raising risk scores above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The code is purely for error handling, with no signs of supply chain or runtime security issues.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - The use of `TYPE_CHECKING` is standard and safe.\n   - No suspicious imports or behaviors are observed.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports avoid assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as standard exception class definitions.\n   - No unwarranted claims about vulnerabilities or malicious intent are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent across reports and align with the code's characteristics.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a straightforward, well-structured set of custom exception classes used for error handling in a larger codebase. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky components. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The code is safe.\n- No changes needed to the reported scores.\n- The overall security posture of this code is neutral, with no concerns.\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n\nMaintain the current scoring, as it accurately reflects the code's nature.",
