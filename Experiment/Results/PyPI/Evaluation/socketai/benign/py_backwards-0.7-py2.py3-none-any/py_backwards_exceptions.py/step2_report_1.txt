  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code only defines custom exception classes.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- The code uses standard Python practices, including TYPE_CHECKING for type hints.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling that could be malicious.\n- No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns noted.\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0, which is consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1. **Code correctness and presence of issues:**\n   - The code is static, well-structured, and typical for defining custom exceptions.\n   - No errors, flaws, or mistakes are present in the code logic.\n   - The exception classes are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n\n2. **Scores assessment:**\n   - Malware score: All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n   - Obfuscated score: All reports assign 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n   - Risk score: All reports assign 0, which is justified given the absence of any security concern.\n\n3. **Potential concerns:**\n   - The only minor point is the import guarded by `TYPE_CHECKING`. This is standard practice and does not introduce any security risk.\n   - No assumptions about vulnerabilities or malicious activity are warranted here.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The code is purely for error handling and does not contain any malicious or suspicious activity.\n   - The scores given in all reports are reasonable and consistent with the code content.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe implementation of custom exception classes with no security concerns. The scores assigned are appropriate and should remain as is.",
