  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the associated code to identify any potential security concerns, inconsistencies, or misjudgments.\n\n**Overall assessment of the code:**\n- The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions.\n- It uses a standard pattern for type hinting with `TYPE_CHECKING`.\n- There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, external interactions, or code execution.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present.\n- The import guard is a common pattern to prevent runtime import issues.\n\n**Specific points:**\n\n1. **Presence of malicious activity or malware:**\n   - The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, file I/O, or code execution.\n   - Exception classes are static and purely for error signaling.\n   - No signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious payloads.\n\n2. **Risk scores:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n   - The security risk score is also 0, aligning with the code's nature.\n   - The obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward class definitions.\n   - The confidence level is high (1), indicating the reviewers are certain of their assessment.\n\n3. **Logical flaws or errors in the reports:**\n   - The reports correctly identify that the code is static, standard, and free of malicious content.\n   - They note the use of `TYPE_CHECKING` as a standard pattern, not a security concern.\n   - No assumptions are made about vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code.\n\n4. **Scores and conclusions:**\n   - Given the code's simplicity and the absence of any suspicious activity, the assigned scores are reasonable.\n   - The conclusion that there are no security risks or malware is justified.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, just for completeness, but effectively zero)\n\n**Final remarks:**\n- The code is a well-structured, standard set of exception classes.\n- No changes to the scores or conclusions are necessary.\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n**Summary:**\n- No malicious or obfuscated code detected.\n- The security risk is negligible.\n- The code serves a typical purpose in error handling without any security implications.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- No further action needed. The code is safe and free of security concerns.",
