  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, potential security implications, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code only defines custom exception classes.\n- It uses standard Python patterns, including TYPE_CHECKING for type hints.\n- There are no external data sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present.\n- The import guard with TYPE_CHECKING is a common, safe practice.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger system's error handling.\n\n**Malware and obfuscation scores:**\n- All reports assign malware = 0 and obfuscated = 0, which aligns with the static, straightforward nature of the code.\n- No report suggests any suspicious or malicious activity; this is consistent.\n\n**Security risk scores:**\n- All reports assign securityRisk = 0, which is appropriate given the code's harmlessness.\n\n**Potential issues or inconsistencies:**\n- The only point to consider is whether the use of TYPE_CHECKING and exception class definitions could be exploited. However, these are standard practices and do not introduce security vulnerabilities.\n- No logic or data handling exists that could be exploited.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks)\n\nThis code is a straightforward, well-structured set of exception class definitions with no security concerns.\n\n**Final note:**\nThe comprehensive analysis confirms that the code is benign and standard for its purpose.",
