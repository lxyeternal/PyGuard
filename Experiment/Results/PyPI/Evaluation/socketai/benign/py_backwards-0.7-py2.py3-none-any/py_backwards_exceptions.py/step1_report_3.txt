{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors related to code compilation, transformation, and input validation.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows as this code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are present. The import guarded by TYPE_CHECKING is standard for type hints and does not execute at runtime.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes with straightforward constructors and docstrings. The import from a relative module is protected by TYPE_CHECKING, which prevents runtime import issues. No code execution, data handling, or external communication occurs. No malicious behavior or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom exception classes with no malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscated components. It serves as part of a larger codebase's error handling mechanism.",
