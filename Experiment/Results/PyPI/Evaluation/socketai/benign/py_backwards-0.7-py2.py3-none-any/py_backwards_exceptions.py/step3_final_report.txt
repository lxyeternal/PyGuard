{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling related to compilation, transformation, and input validation within a larger system.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; the code imports 'TYPE_CHECKING' for type hints conditionally.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing; purely static class definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares exception classes with attribute assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard use of 'TYPE_CHECKING' and straightforward class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is static, defining custom exceptions with no dynamic behavior, external data handling, or network activity. Use of 'TYPE_CHECKING' is a common pattern for type hints. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The exception classes serve error handling purposes and do not process untrusted input or perform any operations that could be exploited. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of security concerns. It does not contain malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
