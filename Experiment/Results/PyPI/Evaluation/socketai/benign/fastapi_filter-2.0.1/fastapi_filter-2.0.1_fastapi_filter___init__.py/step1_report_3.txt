  "purpose": "This code defines exports for a module related to filtering dependencies and prefix handling.",
  "sources": "The import statement from '.base.filter' which imports 'FilterDepends' and 'with_prefix'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input; the code simply imports and exports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain any suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from a local module and defines __all__ for exports. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module export definition with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
