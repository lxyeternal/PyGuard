  "purpose": "The code defines exports for a module, specifically exporting 'FilterDepends' and 'with_prefix' from a relative import.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module path: .base.filter",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data sources or sinks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or input/output handling in this code",
  "anomalies": "The code appears minimal, with no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. No obfuscation or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes/functions from a relative module and defines __all__ for export. There are no data inputs, no network calls, or other actions that could pose security risks. The structure is straightforward and typical for a module's __init__.py or similar file.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard module export setup with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It is safe based on the provided content.",
