{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer or re-export file, importing specific symbols from a local module and defining __all__ for export control.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .base.filter",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Import from .base.filter to module namespace, no data flow involving untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard import and __all__ definition",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal Python module that imports specific classes/functions and defines __all__ for exports. It contains no dynamic behavior, user input handling, network activity, or suspicious constructs. The code is straightforward and follows common Python module patterns. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities are present. The import source is local and presumed safe; no external data flows or untrusted inputs are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security issues. It functions as a standard module re-export pattern. All signals, including malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores, are correctly identified as zero. The confidence in this assessment is high (1).",
