  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports two identifiers from a relative module, then defines __all__ for explicit exports. There are no inputs, user data, or dynamic behaviors. The code appears to be a standard module initialization segment without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and standard for module exports, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
