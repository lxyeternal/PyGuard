{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that re-exports specific components from a local package, likely for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from .base.filter",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations",
  "flows": "Import from .base.filter to module namespace, with no data flow or processing of untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets present",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific symbols from a relative module (.base.filter) and defines __all__ for exports. The structure is straightforward, standard for Python modules, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. No dynamic code execution, no handling of external untrusted input, and no side effects observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module re-export with no malicious intent or security risks. It follows typical Python coding patterns for modular design.",
