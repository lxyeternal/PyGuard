  "conclusion": "The code is a standard filtering utility for FastAPI, performing input validation and dynamic model creation safely. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be 0. The obfuscation score should be 0. The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the dynamic model handling but does not indicate any threat."
