  "purpose": "Provides a base filter model for filtering and sorting in FastAPI, including validation, nested models, and prefixing utilities.",
  "sources": "Class attributes, model fields, validators, and dynamic model creation functions.",
  "sinks": "Model instantiation, validation validators, and dependency injection; no external system calls.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validators and model creation to produce validated filter instances.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python and Pydantic techniques for dynamic model creation, input validation, and nested filter handling. Validators sanitize input, check for duplicates, and strip whitespace. The use of create_model and Depends is typical for FastAPI utilities. No network, file, or system commands are present. The pattern of converting list fields to comma-separated strings is a known workaround for FastAPI's limitations. Overall, the code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for filtering with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard filtering utility for FastAPI, performing input validation and dynamic model creation safely. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be 0. The obfuscation score should be 0. The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the dynamic model handling but does not indicate any threat.",
