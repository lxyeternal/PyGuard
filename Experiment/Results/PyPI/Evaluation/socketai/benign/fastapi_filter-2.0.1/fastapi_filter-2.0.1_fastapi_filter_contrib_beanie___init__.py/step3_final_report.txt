  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer that imports the 'Filter' class from a local module and exposes it for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .filter module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "Import of 'Filter' from local module; exposure via __all__",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward import and export pattern, no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a class from a local module and exposing it via __all__. There are no data flows involving untrusted input, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no obfuscation. The code is a standard Python module pattern, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. All reports correctly identify its benign nature and assign zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and clarity support these conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python module export pattern with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. All reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
