{
  "purpose": "The code exports the Filter class for external use, facilitating modular import in a larger Python package.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .filter import Filter' reads the Filter class from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leakage points are present.",
  "flows": "The only flow is importing the Filter class, then exposing it via __all__ for external use.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "This code is a standard module export pattern in Python, importing a class from a local module and defining __all__ for controlled namespace exposure. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscated code, or security risks. It appears to be part of a package's public API setup, with no suspicious or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module export with no malicious behavior, security risks, or anomalies. It appears benign and intended for normal package structure.",
