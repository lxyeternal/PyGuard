  "purpose": "The code exports the 'Filter' class from a local module named 'filter'.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'filter' for the 'Filter' class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'Filter' from '.filter' and then exposes it via __all__, with no data flow involving external input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "This code serves as an __all__ declaration to control what is exported from the module. It imports 'Filter' from a relative module named 'filter' and explicitly exposes it. There are no data inputs, outputs, or dynamic behaviors. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent are present. The code structure is typical for a module's __init__.py or API interface.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues in this code snippet. It is a simple, benign module export statement.",
