  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- The report states that the code is a straightforward import and export of a class with no malicious behavior.\n- The confidence is high (1), and malware score is 0.\n- No issues detected; the code is minimal and safe.\n- **Score adjustments:** None needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to report 1, with slightly lower confidence (0.9) and a small security risk (0.1).\n- The report suggests the code is benign, just a module export.\n- The security risk score seems a bit high given the code's simplicity.\n- **Score adjustments:** I would lower the `securityRisk` to 0, as there's no evidence of risk beyond standard module structure.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same conclusion: benign, standard module export.\n- Confidence is 1, malware 0.\n- No issues; consistent with previous reports.\n- **Score adjustments:** None.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Again, a simple re-export with no suspicious activity.\n- Confidence is 1, malware 0.\n- No issues.\n- **Score adjustments:** None.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Same as above, benign module re-export.\n- Confidence 1, malware 0.\n- No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple import/export pattern.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The only minor concern was in report 2, which I would rate as a security risk of 0, given the simplicity.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, as there's no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Given the code's simplicity and lack of any suspicious behavior, a risk score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' assessments.** The code is benign, with no security issues.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis.",
