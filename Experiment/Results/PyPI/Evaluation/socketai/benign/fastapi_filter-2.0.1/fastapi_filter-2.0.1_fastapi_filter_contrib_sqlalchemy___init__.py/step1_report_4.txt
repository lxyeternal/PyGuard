{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define the public API of a module by exporting the Filter class.",
  "sources": "The code imports a local module named .filter and references it to expose Filter publicly.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data handling mechanisms present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports a class.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal, with no unusual patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named Filter from a local module, then explicitly exports it in __all__, which is standard practice for defining module interfaces. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. No external data is read, and no data is processed or transmitted. The code's simplicity and lack of side effects suggest it is safe and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward module interface definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It simply exposes a class for use elsewhere.",
