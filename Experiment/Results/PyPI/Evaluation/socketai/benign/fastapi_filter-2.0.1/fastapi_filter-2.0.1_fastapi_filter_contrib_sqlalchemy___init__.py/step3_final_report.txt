  "purpose": "Module export pattern importing 'Filter' from a local module and exposing it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .filter module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; static import only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import and export statement, standard in Python modules. It does not process data, perform network operations, or handle sensitive information. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The import from a local module is typical and does not indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the simplicity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export statement with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safety, and the scores are consistent with its function.",
