  "purpose": "The code exports the 'Filter' class from a local module for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statement: 'from .filter import Filter' and the '__all__' declaration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not contain any suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports a class from a local module and defines what is publicly available when the module is imported. There are no data inputs, no processing, no external network calls, and no suspicious logic. The minimal nature of the code reduces the likelihood of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard module export statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, benign codebase.",
