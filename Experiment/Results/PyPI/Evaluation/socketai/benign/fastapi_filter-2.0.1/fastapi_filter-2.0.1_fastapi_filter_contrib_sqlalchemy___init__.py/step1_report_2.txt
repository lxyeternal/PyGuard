{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package module that exports a class or function named 'Filter' for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from .filter import Filter' suggests reading the 'filter' module in the same package directory.",
  "sinks": "The '__all__' variable is used for module exports; no sinks related to untrusted data processing are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present; the code only performs an import and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a 'Filter' component from a local module and declares it for public export. It is a standard pattern in Python packages for module exports. No indications of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are observed. The simplicity and conventional structure reduce suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, functioning as a module export definition. No malicious intent or security issues are detected.",
