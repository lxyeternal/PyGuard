  "purpose": "Defines the module exports by importing the Filter class from a local filter module.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .filter import Filter' reads the Filter class from a local module named filter.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The only flow is the import of Filter from the local module, which does not involve untrusted data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a class named Filter from a relative module and declares it as part of the public API via __all__. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or potentially malicious actions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security risks. The code is clear, standard, and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This is a basic module export statement with no malicious intent or security issues. It appears to be part of a larger package with no suspicious behavior in this fragment.",
