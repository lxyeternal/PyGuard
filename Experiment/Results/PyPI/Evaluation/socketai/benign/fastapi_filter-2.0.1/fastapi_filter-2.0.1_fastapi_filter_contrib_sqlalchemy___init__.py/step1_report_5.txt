  "sources": "Import statement importing 'Filter' from a local module './filter'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow to external systems or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs a module import and exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class named 'Filter' from a local module named 'filter' and exposes it via '__all__' for external modules to use. There are no input reading operations, data processing, or security-sensitive actions. The code structure is standard and simple, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign module that re-exports a class from a local module, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
