      "conclusion": "The majority of code appears benign with appropriate low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5's obfuscation and dynamic code features warrant a higher malware score (~0.5), reflecting increased suspicion. Adjusting the malware score upward provides a more accurate risk assessment without overestimating confirmed malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard filtering utility for FastAPI, performing input validation and dynamic model creation safely. No malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be 0. The obfuscation score should be 0. The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the dynamic model handling but does not indicate any threat."

      "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, all reports accurately reflect the limited information and assign appropriate low risk and malware scores. The absence of code justifies zero obfuscation and malware scores, with low but cautious risk scores (~0.2). The evaluations are consistent, and no further adjustments are necessary."

The slight risk score reflects the potential for misuse if inputs are not validated externally, but within this code, it remains safe and standard."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical, non-malicious ORM filtering utility that relies on SQLAlchemy's safeguards. Its primary security concern is the absence of validation on user inputs influencing attribute access and operators, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. No malware or obfuscation is present. The overall security risk is low but warrants validation improvements for production use."

It performs typical filtering operations safely, with no obfuscation or backdoors. The overall security posture is sound, and the code is suitable for use in production environments with standard precautions."
