  "purpose": "Assessment of supply chain security and malicious behavior in open source Python dependencies based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Not applicable; reports lack code snippets or detailed data sources.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; no untrusted data flows identified due to absence of code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no source-to-sink data flows can be determined without code.",
  "anomalies": "None detected; reports correctly identify lack of suspicious patterns or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly acknowledge the absence of code, limiting analysis. Reports with minimal information assign low risk scores (~0.2) and zero malware and obfuscation scores, which are consistent with their conclusions. High confidence levels (0.9) are justified where detailed reasoning is provided. The scores are appropriate given the evidence, and no suspicious behavior or malicious indicators are identified. The assessments are internally consistent and align with best practices for code review without actual code samples.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, all reports accurately reflect the limited information and assign appropriate low risk and malware scores. The absence of code justifies zero obfuscation and malware scores, with low but cautious risk scores (~0.2). The evaluations are consistent, and no further adjustments are necessary.",
