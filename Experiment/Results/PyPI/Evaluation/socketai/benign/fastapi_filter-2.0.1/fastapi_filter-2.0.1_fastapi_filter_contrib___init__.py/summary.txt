  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, all reports accurately reflect the limited information and assign appropriate low risk and malware scores. The absence of code justifies zero obfuscation and malware scores, with low but cautious risk scores (~0.2). The evaluations are consistent, and no further adjustments are necessary."
