  "purpose": "This code exports the 'Filter' class from the local 'filter' module for use in other parts of the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'Filter' from a relative module; no external input or data read operations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not handle or process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only performs module exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class and defines an export list, which is typical in Python modules for organizing package exports. It does not include any dynamic code execution, data handling, or suspicious patterns. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define module exports. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
