{
  "purpose": "The code defines a module that imports the 'Filter' class from a relative 'filter' module and exposes it as part of the module's public API.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a relative import statement ('from .filter import Filter') which depends on the presence of a 'filter' module in the same package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this code. There are no network calls, file writes, or data processing that could leak or manipulate data.",
  "flows": "The import statement may load code from the 'filter' module, but without inspecting that module, no specific data flow can be determined. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code simply performs a local import of a class from a sibling module and defines an export list. It contains no dynamic execution, network activity, or sensitive operations. The structure appears standard for a Python package module. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard module definition with an import statement and an __all__ declaration. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
