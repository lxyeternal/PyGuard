{
  "purpose": "This code module imports the 'Filter' class from a local 'filter' module and exposes it via __all__ for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .filter module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data flow or external output",
  "flows": "Import of 'Filter' from local module; no data flow beyond module import/export",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import/export pattern, no obfuscation or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing a class and exposing it, with no data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. All reports agree on its benign nature. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0, confidence=1) are appropriate. The security risk depends on the 'Filter' class implementation, but this snippet alone shows no issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module export pattern with no security risks or malicious intent. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. No further action needed.",
