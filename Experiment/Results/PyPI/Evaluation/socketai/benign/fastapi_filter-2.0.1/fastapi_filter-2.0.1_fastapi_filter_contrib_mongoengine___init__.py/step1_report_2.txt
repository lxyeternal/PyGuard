{
  "purpose": "The code defines an import of the 'Filter' class from a local module and sets the __all__ attribute for module exports.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'Filter' from a local module, which may involve reading from the file system or package structure.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident; the code only sets up module exports without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a simple module declaration that imports a class from a relative module and specifies what symbols to export. It contains no runtime logic, user input handling, or external data processing. Its structure and content are typical for a Python package's __init__.py file or module export setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for Python package modules, and does not exhibit malicious or security risk behavior.",
