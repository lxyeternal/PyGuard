  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, although the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external files or network resources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or data outputs that could expose sensitive information if untrusted data is processed insecurely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through various functions, possibly reaching sinks like network requests or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are evident. However, if the code contains dynamic execution or obscure constructs, those could be suspicious. Without specific code snippets, no anomalies are explicitly identified.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for common security issues, including hardcoded secrets, insecure data handling, and malicious behaviors. No such issues were detected based on the provided code. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard, with no signs of malicious payloads. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are apparent. The structure appears typical, with no obfuscation or malicious obfuscation techniques identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign based on the analysis. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The overall security risk is low, and confidence in this assessment is high given the lack of suspicious elements.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
