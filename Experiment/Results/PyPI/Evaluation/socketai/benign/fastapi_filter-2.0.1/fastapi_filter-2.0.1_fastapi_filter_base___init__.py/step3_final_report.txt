  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on supply chain threats, obfuscation, and suspicious activity.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, configuration files, network connections, function parameters, external files, standard input.",
  "sinks": "File writes, system commands, network transmissions, database interactions, system calls, eval()/exec() functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into sinks like network, file, or system commands, potentially via dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, use of eval()/exec(), suspicious strings, dynamic code execution, signs of concealment, hardcoded secrets (if any), unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "Most reports describe code with typical data sources and sinks, with no obfuscation or malicious activity detected, justified by high confidence scores and low malware/security risk scores. Report 5, however, notes obfuscation and dynamic code execution, which are red flags. The initial malware score of 0.2 for report 5 appears conservative given the suspicious features. Considering the presence of obfuscation and eval()/exec(), a higher malware score (around 0.5) is justified, reflecting elevated suspicion but no confirmed malicious payloads. Obfuscation score of 0.7 remains appropriate, and security risk of 0.4 captures the moderate concern. Overall, the scores for reports 1-4 are consistent with their benign descriptions. For report 5, increasing malware score to 0.5 aligns better with the suspicious indicators, balancing the lack of confirmed malicious activity with the risk factors identified.",
  "conclusion": "The majority of code appears benign with appropriate low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5's obfuscation and dynamic code features warrant a higher malware score (~0.5), reflecting increased suspicion. Adjusting the malware score upward provides a more accurate risk assessment without overestimating confirmed malicious activity.",
