  "conclusion": "The majority of code appears benign with appropriate low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5's obfuscation and dynamic code features warrant a higher malware score (~0.5), reflecting increased suspicion. Adjusting the malware score upward provides a more accurate risk assessment without overestimating confirmed malicious activity."
