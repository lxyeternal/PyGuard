{
  "purpose": "This code performs cryptographic proof generation and verification using the chiavdf library, testing the prove and verify functions with timing measurements.",
  "sources": "secrets.token_bytes() for challenge generation, no external data sources beyond standard library functions",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; internal cryptographic functions and assertions only",
  "flows": "discriminant challenge -> create_discriminant; prove -> verify_wesolowski; proof outputs -> verify functions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward cryptographic test suite utilizing secure randomness and standard functions. It performs proof creation and verification with internal assertions, timing the operations. No network, file, or environment variable interactions are present. The external library functions are presumed secure, and the code structure is clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign cryptographic testing routine with no malicious intent or security flaws. It does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.15,
