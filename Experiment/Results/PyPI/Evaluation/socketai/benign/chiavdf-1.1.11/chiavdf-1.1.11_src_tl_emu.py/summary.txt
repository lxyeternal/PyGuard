  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured VDF client with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at 0. The low risk score (~0.1) reflects the protocol's benign nature. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
