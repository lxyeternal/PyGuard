      "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptographic verification implementation with no active malicious behavior. The primary risks stem from the potential misuse of crafted proof data in untrusted environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero risk due to input handling. The code is clear and trustworthy within its cryptographic context."

      "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build and installation setup for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. The minor security considerations relate to environment variable manipulation and subprocess execution, which are typical in build systems but do not constitute malicious activity."

The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate at 0. The low risk score (~0.1) reflects the protocol's benign nature. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use."
