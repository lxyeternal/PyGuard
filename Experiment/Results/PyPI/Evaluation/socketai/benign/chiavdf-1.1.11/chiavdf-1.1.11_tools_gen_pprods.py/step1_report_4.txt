{
  "purpose": "Generate a C header file containing products of consecutive odd prime numbers, grouped such that each product fits into 64 bits.",
  "sources": "Input source: command-line argument (sys.argv[1]) for the upper limit n. Data derived internally from prime calculations.",
  "sinks": "The output function print_pprods_h outputs a generated C header file content.",
  "flows": "The code reads the upper limit from sys.argv, computes prime products, and then outputs formatted C code via print().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The print statements are only for debugging and code generation purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script takes an integer input n, iterates through numbers from 3 to n, checks for primality, and constructs products of consecutive primes. When the product exceeds 64 bits, it saves the current product and factors, then resets. The output is a C header file defining an array of these products. Debugging functions print information to stderr, but do not perform malicious actions. No external network access, data leakage, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility script for generating C header files with prime product data. No malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
