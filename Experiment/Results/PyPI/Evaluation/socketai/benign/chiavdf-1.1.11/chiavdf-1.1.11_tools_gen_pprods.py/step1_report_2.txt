{
  "purpose": "The script generates a C header file containing product values of consecutive prime numbers and their factors, formatted for inclusion in a C program.",
  "sources": "Reads the command-line argument for 'n', iterates through numbers from 3 to n, and reads prime numbers identified within the loop.",
  "sinks": "Outputs generated product data via print_pprods_h(), which writes to standard output.",
  "flows": "Input (n) -> prime detection loop -> calculation of prime products -> formatted output to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code. No data exfiltration, network activity, or obfuscated behavior. The code’s purpose appears strictly computational and code generation based. No dynamic code execution or insecure data handling is present.",
  "analysis": "The code starts by importing math and sys modules, defining a list of small primes, and a function to check primality against this list. It then takes an integer input n, iterates from 3 up to n, checking for primes, and computes products of consecutive primes, storing them until they exceed 64 bits, at which point the current product and factors are saved. The output is a generated C header with the products and their factors. The logic is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The print statements are solely for code generation and debugging. No external data is fetched, no sensitive data is leaked, and no suspicious network activity or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign task of generating prime product data for C code, with no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a utility script for code generation purposes, with no malicious behavior detected.",
