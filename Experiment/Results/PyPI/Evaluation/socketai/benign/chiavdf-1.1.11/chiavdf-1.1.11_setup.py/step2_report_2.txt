  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the core aspects: code presence, logic flaws, scoring consistency, and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The script is a standard build setup for 'chiavdf' involving CMake, Make, and file copying. No malicious behavior, secrets, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The code performs typical build operations without suspicious activity. The low risk score is appropriate, given the standard nature of build scripts.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on environment variables influencing build steps, subprocess calls, and file copying. The use of subprocess with shell=True is noted but deemed acceptable here.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning correctly identifies potential risks associated with environment variables and subprocess calls but finds no malicious intent. The slightly higher risk score accounts for environment manipulation possibilities.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable; no malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on build orchestration, subprocess calls, and environment variables. Similar conclusions: standard build process, no malicious code, low risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent; no suspicious activity. The low risk score aligns with the benign nature of the script.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical build script with external commands and file copying. Potential risks from environment variables and subprocess calls are acknowledged but deemed low.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is consistent. No malicious activity or obfuscation found.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others; build orchestration with hooks, external commands, and file copying. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough and aligns with the code's nature.\n- **Conclusion:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a build script for a Python package, involving external build tools and file copying.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign malware=0, which is accurate; no malicious code, network activity, or backdoors are present.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign obfuscated=0, which is correct; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk scores:** They range from 0.2 to 0.3, justified by the use of subprocess with shell=True and environment variables influencing build steps. These are reasonable given the context.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 across reports, indicating high certainty in the analysis.\n\n### Final judgment:\n\n- The code is a standard, legitimate build script with no malicious intent.\n- The potential security concerns are minimal and relate mainly to environment variable manipulation, which is common in build systems.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — slight concern due to subprocess calls and environment variables, but overall low risk.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical build setup script with no security concerns beyond standard build environment risks.",
