  "purpose": "Build and install setup script for the 'chiavdf' Python package, managing build hooks, copying source files, and invoking external build tools like cmake and make.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (BUILD_VDF_CLIENT, BUILD_VDF_BENCH), subprocess calls to 'cmake', 'make', and file copying functions.",
  "sinks": "External commands executed via subprocess, copying files to installation directory.",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence whether build hooks are invoked; subprocess calls execute build commands; file copying functions transfer source files to install directory.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with shell=True for 'make' invocation, which could pose risks if inputs are manipulated, but commands are fixed and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard build setup for a Python package involving C++ extensions. It manages hooks, copies files, and runs external build tools based on environment variables. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious network activity are present. The subprocess calls are typical for build scripts, and the environment variables are used to control build steps, which is common. The use of shell=True in subprocess is a minor concern but is safe here due to fixed commands. Overall, the script does not exhibit malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are consistent with the code's nature and potential environmental manipulation risks.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build and installation setup for a Python package, with no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. The minor security considerations relate to environment variable manipulation and subprocess execution, which are typical in build systems but do not constitute malicious activity.",
