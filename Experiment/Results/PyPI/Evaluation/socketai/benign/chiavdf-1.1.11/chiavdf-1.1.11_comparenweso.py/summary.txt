  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptographic verification implementation with no active malicious behavior. The primary risks stem from the potential misuse of crafted proof data in untrusted environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero risk due to input handling. The code is clear and trustworthy within its cryptographic context."
