  "purpose": "Cryptographic verification of class group elements and Wesolowski proofs, used for validating nested proofs and benchmarking cryptographic routines.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from deserialized proof blobs, external proof verification functions, and hardcoded test data.",
  "sinks": "Places where untrusted data could influence verification outcomes, primarily through deserialized proof blobs and proof inputs.",
  "flows": "Input data (proof blobs) are deserialized into class group elements; these are then used as inputs to verification functions, forming source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of large, hardcoded proof data and test loops; no malicious payloads or system modifications detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs cryptographic verification routines involving class groups and Wesolowski proofs. It relies on external, trusted cryptographic functions. The use of static proof data and extensive testing loops suggests a benchmarking or testing context rather than malicious activity. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or system interference are present. The deserialization routines are standard but could be exploited if malicious proof data is supplied. Overall, the code appears benign, with minimal security risks related to input handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard cryptographic verification implementation with no active malicious behavior. The primary risks stem from the potential misuse of crafted proof data in untrusted environments. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2, reflecting low but non-zero risk due to input handling. The code is clear and trustworthy within its cryptographic context.",
