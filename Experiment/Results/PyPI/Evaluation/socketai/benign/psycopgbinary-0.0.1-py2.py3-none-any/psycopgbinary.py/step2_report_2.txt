  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Issue present?** No. The code is a simple import wrapper with no malicious code.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The reasoning correctly identifies the benign nature.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 seem reasonable given the minimal risk.  \n- **Justification for scores:** The risk is low, primarily because it relies on the integrity of 'psycopg2'. No malicious activity is indicated.  \n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Issue present?** No. The code is a minimal placeholder with benign intent.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The analysis correctly states it's harmless.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.  \n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no obfuscation, and the purpose is benign.  \n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Issue present?** No. Similar to previous, it's a simple import for aliasing.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The reasoning aligns with the code's simplicity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n- **Justification:** Slightly higher risk score (0.1) is acceptable due to the potential for misuse if 'psycopg2' is compromised, but overall, it's low.  \n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Issue present?** No. Again, a benign placeholder with no malicious intent.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The analysis correctly states it's harmless.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.  \n- **Justification:** Same reasoning as above.  \n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Issue present?** No. The use of 'import *' is noted but not malicious.  \n- **Errors/flaws?** No. The report correctly notes namespace pollution but not malicious intent.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.  \n- **Justification:** The use of 'import *' could be risky in some contexts, but here it is benign, so the risk score is appropriate.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the clear, straightforward code.  \n- **Risk Score:** Mostly very low (0.1-0.2), which is appropriate given the benign nature but acknowledging the potential for misuse if 'psycopg2' were compromised.\n\n### My Overall Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation present.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 — very low, primarily due to reliance on an external package and the use of 'import *', which can be risky but is not malicious here.\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code's purpose is clearly benign, serving as a placeholder or alias for an existing library. The potential security concern is minimal and mostly theoretical, related to the trustworthiness of 'psycopg2'. No changes to scores are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n- **Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1",
