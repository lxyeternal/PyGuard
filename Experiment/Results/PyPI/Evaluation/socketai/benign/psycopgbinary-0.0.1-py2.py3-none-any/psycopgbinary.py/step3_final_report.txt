  "purpose": "Placeholder script to alias 'psycopg2-binary' as 'psycopg2binary' for import convenience.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from psycopg2 import *'",
  "sinks": "The import statement itself; no data flow or external data sources involved",
  "flows": "Importing symbols from external 'psycopg2' module into current namespace",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' which can cause namespace pollution; no malicious code or obfuscation present",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward placeholder that imports all symbols from 'psycopg2'. It contains no malicious logic, obfuscation, or embedded secrets. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which is discouraged but not malicious. The purpose is to serve as an alias or wrapper, relying on the integrity of 'psycopg2'. The security implications are minimal, with no signs of malware or sabotage. The code's benign nature is confirmed by multiple expert assessments, with scores reflecting low risk and no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder intended for aliasing 'psycopg2-binary'. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which is a best practice issue but not a security threat. Overall, the code is safe and its scores are appropriate.",
