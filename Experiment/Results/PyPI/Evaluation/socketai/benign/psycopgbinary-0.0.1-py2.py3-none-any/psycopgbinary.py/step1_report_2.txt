{
  "purpose": "The code serves as a placeholder package for 'psycopg2-binary', allowing import with a different name.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'psycopg2' module import statement.",
  "sinks": "The import statement could lead to the inclusion of the 'psycopg2' package but does not directly lead to untrusted data flow or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the import statement loads an external module without further data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or unusual features. The comment clarifies purpose but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily consists of a shebang, encoding declaration, and a comment explaining its purpose as a placeholder package. It imports all symbols from 'psycopg2'. The import is standard and does not execute any malicious code or contain embedded payloads. No sources or sinks are involved in a way that would facilitate data leaks or malicious activity. The code does not perform any dynamic execution, network activity, or system modifications. It appears to be a benign stub meant for package aliasing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless placeholder file used for package aliasing with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply imports a known external library without any suspicious behavior.",
