{
  "purpose": "Placeholder package that imports everything from the 'psycopg2' library for use under a different name 'psycopg2binary'.",
  "sources": "The code imports all symbols from the 'psycopg2' module.",
  "sinks": "Import statement is the main sink, which could potentially import malicious or unintended code if the 'psycopg2' package is compromised.",
  "flows": "Code imports from 'psycopg2', which could lead to execution of malicious code if the package is maliciously modified.",
  "anomalies": "The file is almost empty, with the only action being an import statement; the comment indicates a placeholder purpose, which is unusual but not malicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The script acts as a wrapper or alias for the 'psycopg2' package, allowing it to be imported under a different name. The import statement pulls all symbols from 'psycopg2', which is common in Python but can be risky if 'psycopg2' is compromised. There are no obfuscated or malicious code patterns present. The comment clarifies that this is a placeholder package, not intended for any malicious purpose. No other code or data flows are present. The risk depends on the integrity of 'psycopg2', which is an established library, but the approach could potentially mask malicious packages or modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple wrapper for the 'psycopg2' library with no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. Its primary function is to facilitate import under a different name. There are no embedded malicious behaviors or anomalies. Overall, it appears benign, assuming 'psycopg2' is legitimate.",
