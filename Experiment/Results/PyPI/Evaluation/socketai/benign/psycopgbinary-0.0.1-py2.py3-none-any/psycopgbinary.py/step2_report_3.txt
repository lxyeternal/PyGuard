  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a minimal placeholder importing everything from 'psycopg2'.\n- The code is benign in appearance, with no embedded malicious logic.\n- The main concern is the use of `from psycopg2 import *`, which can be risky if 'psycopg2' is compromised or malicious, but 'psycopg2' is a well-known, reputable library.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are present.\n- The purpose is to create an alias or placeholder for package import.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code **does** import from 'psycopg2', which could be a vector if 'psycopg2' is malicious or compromised.\n- No malicious code or obfuscation is present.\n- The code itself is benign.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- The use of `import *` is generally discouraged because it pollutes the namespace, but it is not malicious.\n- The reports correctly identify that the code is a placeholder and that the risk depends on the integrity of 'psycopg2'.\n\n### Scoring analysis:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Security risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.2; some consider the import pattern as a potential risk but acknowledge that it's unlikely to be malicious.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, which is correct.\n- **Confidence scores:** Mostly high (0.8-1), appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk > 0.5, which is correct. The risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the trustworthiness of 'psycopg2'.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All reports are consistent in their assessment that the code is benign and that the main concern is the import pattern, which is standard but can be risky if the package is compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code detected or implied.  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 — low, based on dependency trustworthiness and import pattern.\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code is a simple placeholder for package aliasing, with no signs of malicious activity. The main concern is the reliance on the integrity of 'psycopg2', but this is an established, reputable library.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of recommended scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the analysis provided.",
