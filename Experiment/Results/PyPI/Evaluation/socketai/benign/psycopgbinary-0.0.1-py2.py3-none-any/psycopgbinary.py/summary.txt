  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder intended for aliasing 'psycopg2-binary'. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risk. The main concern is the use of 'import *', which is a best practice issue but not a security threat. Overall, the code is safe and its scores are appropriate."
