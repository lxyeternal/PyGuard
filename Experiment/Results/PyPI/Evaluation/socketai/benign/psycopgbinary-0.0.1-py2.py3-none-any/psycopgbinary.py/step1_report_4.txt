  "purpose": "Placeholder module for 'psycopg2-binary' with an import alias for easier use.",
  "sources": "No input or external data read by the code.",
  "sinks": "No data or untrusted input is processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports a package.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports all from 'psycopg2', which could be unusual if not used, but not inherently malicious. No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script is primarily a placeholder, intended to allow importing 'psycopg2' with a different name. It contains a comment explaining its purpose and performs a simple import. There is no malicious logic, data handling, or network activity. The import statement could potentially be misused if misconfigured, but in itself, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder module with no malicious behavior. It does not pose security risks or supply chain threats.",
