{
  "purpose": "Placeholder package for 'psycopg2-binary' with importable name 'psycopg2binary'.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from psycopg2 import *'.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of wildcard import which could import all functions, variables, or malicious code if present in 'psycopg2' package.",
  "flows": "Code imports all symbols from 'psycopg2' package, which could lead to unintentional execution of malicious code if 'psycopg2' is compromised.",
  "anomalies": "The file is nearly empty, acting as a placeholder, but it re-exports 'psycopg2' symbols, which is unusual for a placeholder. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal placeholder that re-exports all components from the 'psycopg2' package. The purpose appears to be to provide an import alias or workaround. There is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The use of 'import *' is notable but not malicious in itself; it can pose security risks if the imported package contains malicious code, but this is not evidenced here. No hardcoded secrets, environment variable misuse, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder intended for import aliasing with no signs of malicious behavior. Its security risk is minimal, but the use of 'import *' should be noted as a potential namespace pollution concern rather than a malicious one.",
