  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, secure, and standard component for HTML sanitization and parsing. It does not contain malicious, backdoor, or obfuscated code. The low malware score (0), absence of obfuscation (0), and low security risk (~0.2) are justified given its purpose and implementation. It is safe for use in security-sensitive contexts."
