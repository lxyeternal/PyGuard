  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code provides a sanitization utility wrapping html5lib components, handling input streams, entities, and output serialization.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns detected. Entity handling appears standard and secure. The stream management and custom tokenizer are designed for controlled sanitization.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — consistent with benign, security-focused code.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score reflects the utility's purpose. No signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing safe HTML parsing and entity handling.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity or backdoors. Entity handling is careful, and the code is a wrapper for sanitization.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** The code's purpose aligns with safe HTML sanitization, and no malicious patterns are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Acts as a shim for html5lib, with custom tokenization and serialization.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious intent, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation. Entity conversions are standard, and the code manages streams securely.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score matches the benign, sanitization-oriented purpose.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar role as above, focusing on compatibility and sanitization.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity. The code is a standard wrapper around trusted libraries, with careful entity handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** The purpose and implementation are aligned with secure HTML processing.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as previous, focusing on safe parsing and sanitization.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected. The code is a compatibility layer with controlled entity handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, Obfuscated: 0, Risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious intent; the code's purpose is clear and security-conscious.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the code's purpose as a sanitization and parsing utility.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation patterns or suspicious constructs are present.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero, reflecting the potential for misconfiguration or misuse, but given the code's benign nature, a low score is appropriate.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** **0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0**\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (consistent with a utility that handles untrusted data but is itself safe)\n\n**Note:** The code's design is standard for a sanitization library, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk score is justified due to its role in processing untrusted input, but it does not indicate a security vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a secure, well-structured component for HTML sanitization, entity handling, and parsing, with no malicious or obfuscated elements detected. The scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, and risk=0.2.",
