  "purpose": "A simple local server that accepts POST requests with text data, cleans the input using bleach.clean to sanitize HTML, and returns the sanitized output.",
  "sources": "Reads HTTP POST request body via self.rfile.read() and headers via self.headers.get()",
  "sinks": "Outputs cleaned data via self.wfile.write() and prints to console",
  "flows": "HTTP POST input -> bleach.clean() -> HTTP response output",
  "anomalies": "None observed; straightforward implementation with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code segments",
  "analysis": "The code implements a basic HTTP server on localhost that processes POST requests. It reads the request body, decodes it, and sanitizes the content using bleach.clean(), which is a standard library for sanitizing HTML. The sanitized output is then returned to the client. No external or untrusted data sources besides HTTP input are used. There are no suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no network activity beyond the local server. The use of bleach for sanitization is a common security practice. Overall, the code appears safe with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The server performs a benign sanitization of input data and returns the cleaned content. There are no indications of malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
