{
  "purpose": "A simple local HTTP server that receives HTML content via POST requests, sanitizes it using bleach.clean, and returns the sanitized output.",
  "sources": "HTTP POST request body read from self.rfile in do_POST method.",
  "sinks": "Output written to self.wfile after sanitization, and data printed to console; the main processing step is bleach.clean applied to input data.",
  "flows": "Input data from HTTP POST → body decoded to UTF-8 → passed to bleach.clean → output sent back in HTTP response.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code; standard use of bleach for sanitization. No external network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a local HTTP server that handles POST requests by reading the request body, decoding it, and applying bleach.clean to sanitize potentially unsafe HTML content. The sanitized result is then sent back to the client. The server runs only on localhost (127.0.0.1), limiting exposure. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected, and the use of bleach is appropriate for sanitizing HTML inputs. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a local sanitization server using bleach, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and intended for testing or demonstration purposes.",
