{
  "purpose": "A local HTTP server that sanitizes HTML input using bleach.clean for testing or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads POST request body from the HTTP request's rfile, specifically the 'content-length' header to determine input size.",
  "sinks": "The sanitized output is sent back via self.wfile.write; no external network or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "Input data is received from the POST request, decoded as UTF-8, processed through bleach.clean, then returned as the HTTP response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. The server binds only to localhost, limiting external exposure.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a simple local server on 127.0.0.1:8080 that handles POST requests by reading the input, sanitizing it with bleach.clean, and returning the sanitized content. It does not perform any malicious actions, network connections, or data exfiltration. The use of bleach for sanitization is standard and appropriate. The server's confinement to localhost minimizes security risks. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0–0.2) are consistent with the code's benign and straightforward nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward implementation of a local HTML sanitization server. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The assigned scores accurately reflect its safe and limited scope.",
