{
  "purpose": "A simple local HTTP server that receives POST requests with HTML content, sanitizes it using bleach.clean, and returns the sanitized output.",
  "sources": "HTTP POST request body read from self.rfile",
  "sinks": "Response written to self.wfile after sanitization",
  "flows": "Input received from HTTP POST -> processed and sanitized with bleach.clean -> sent back in HTTP response",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; use of bleach is straightforward and intended for sanitization. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a local server on localhost, handles POST requests by reading the input body, and sanitizes this input with bleach.clean to prevent XSS or malicious HTML. It then responds with the sanitized content. The logic is simple, with no external data leaks, credential handling, or network connections beyond localhost. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident; the code appears to serve a demonstration or testing purpose only.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward server for sanitizing HTML input. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. It operates solely on localhost and performs a basic sanitization task as intended.",
