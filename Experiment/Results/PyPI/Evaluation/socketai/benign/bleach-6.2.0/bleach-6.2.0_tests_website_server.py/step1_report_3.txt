{
  "purpose": "A simple HTTP server that receives POST requests containing HTML content, cleans it using bleach.clean to sanitize potentially malicious or unsafe HTML, and responds with the cleaned output.",
  "sources": "The server reads incoming data from the HTTP request body via self.rfile.read(). It does not read from external sources or files; input is solely from the HTTP POST request body.",
  "sinks": "The cleaned HTML output generated by bleach.clean() is sent back in the HTTP response via self.wfile.write(). The server also prints debug information to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input from the POST request body (self.rfile.read) → decoded string → bleach.clean() processing → response output (self.wfile.write) with sanitized HTML.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward and uses standard libraries; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are present. The server is bound to localhost only, limiting external exposure.",
  "analysis": "The server receives POST data, decodes it, and applies bleach.clean() to sanitize the HTML content. Bleach.clean() is a standard library function designed to prevent XSS and malicious HTML injection. The server then responds with the sanitized content. No untrusted data is used in dangerous ways (e.g., no code execution, no data exfiltration). The code runs locally and does not perform network connections beyond listening on localhost. The overall logic appears to be for sanitization testing or demonstration, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, demonstration-oriented HTTP server that sanitizes HTML input using bleach and returns the sanitized output. No malware or malicious behavior is present. It operates securely within its scope, with no evident security risks or suspicious activity.",
