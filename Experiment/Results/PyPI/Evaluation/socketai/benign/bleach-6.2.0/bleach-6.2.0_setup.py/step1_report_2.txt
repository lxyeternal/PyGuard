  "purpose": "This script is used for configuring the packaging and distribution of the 'bleach' Python library, including reading metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads from files 'README.rst', 'CHANGES', and '__init__.py' within the 'bleach' directory to obtain long description and version information.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is processed or outputted to external systems.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and assigns their contents to variables, then passes these variables into the setup() function for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are detected. The code performs standard package setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks: reading files for long description, extracting version info via regex, defining dependencies, and invoking setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No suspicious or malicious code is present. There are no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no data leaks. The usage of standard libraries and well-known setup patterns indicates low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python package setup configuration with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
