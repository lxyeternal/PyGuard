{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for the 'bleach' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and version extraction.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'README.rst', 'CHANGES', and '__init__.py' to gather long description and version info.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data; setup configuration and file reads are standard.",
  "flows": "File reading flows from disk to variables used in package metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. No dynamic code execution or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures: reading documentation files, extracting version info via regex, defining dependencies, and calling setup(). No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. All operations are typical for Python package configuration. No external inputs or untrusted data handling beyond file reads, which are safe and standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs package configuration tasks securely and transparently.",
