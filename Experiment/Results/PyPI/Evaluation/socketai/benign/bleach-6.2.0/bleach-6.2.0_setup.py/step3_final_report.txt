{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for the 'bleach' Python package, responsible for reading documentation files and extracting version information to configure package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst', 'CHANGES', and 'bleach/__init__.py' files from the local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; standard file reading operations without external or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Reads static files to obtain description and version; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical package setup tasks: reading static documentation files, extracting version info via regex, and invoking setuptools.setup(). All operations are standard and do not involve untrusted input or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, network activity, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
