  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'bleach' Python package, used for HTML sanitization and packaging the project for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.rst', 'CHANGES', and 'bleach/__init__.py' files to gather long description and version information.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious behavior are present.",
  "flows": "Reads data from local files ('README.rst', 'CHANGES', '__init__.py') to assemble package metadata; no external data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are present. The code appears to be a standard setup script with proper usage.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations, including reading files for description and extracting version information via regex. No external data is fetched or processed insecurely. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. All imports are standard and used appropriately for packaging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical and legitimate setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
