{
  "purpose": "This script defines the setup configuration for the 'bleach' Python package, including metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading files 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES' for long description; reading '__init__.py' for version info.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; setup parameters are standard and do not handle untrusted input.",
  "flows": "File reading flows from filesystem into variables, then into setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward package setup tasks: reading files for descriptions, extracting version info with regex, defining dependencies, and calling setuptools.setup(). All operations are standard for Python package configuration. No malicious behavior, malicious data flow, or obfuscation detected. The only potential concern could be if the file reads or version extraction were tampered with externally, but within this code, all actions are typical and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or malicious code. It properly reads necessary files and configures package parameters without any suspicious behavior.",
