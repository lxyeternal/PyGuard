  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for the 'bleach' Python package, used to define package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "File reading functions (get_long_desc, get_version), package metadata variables, and import statements.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "Reading README and CHANGES files for long description, extracting version info from __init__.py, and passing data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution observed. The code follows standard setup procedures.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and defines functions to read files for long description and version info. It constructs the setup() call with package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network calls, dynamic code execution, or data exfiltration. The code's purpose is purely to facilitate package installation, with no suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It reads package information from files and prepares distribution data without any anomalous or harmful actions.",
