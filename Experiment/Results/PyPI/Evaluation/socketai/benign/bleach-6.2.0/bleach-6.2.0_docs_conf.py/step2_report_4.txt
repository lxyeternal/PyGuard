  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- The code is a standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- It imports `os`, `sys`, and `bleach`.\n- It adds the parent directory to `sys.path` to facilitate local imports.\n- It reads `bleach.__version__` and `bleach.__releasedate__` for project versioning.\n- No dynamic code execution, user input, or external data handling.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Standard Sphinx config, imports bleach, reads version info.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is standard and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Anomalies: None.\n- Malware score: 0.\n- Security risk: 0.\n- Confidence: 1.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, which is accurate. The code does not contain any malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the script.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code's actual content. No hidden or malicious behavior is present, and the code is typical for documentation configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, safe Sphinx configuration script that imports `bleach` solely to access version info. The scores assigned in all reports are appropriate and justified. No adjustments needed.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
