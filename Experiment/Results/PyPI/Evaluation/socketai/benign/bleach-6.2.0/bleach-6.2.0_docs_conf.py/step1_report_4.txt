{
  "purpose": "The code configures Sphinx documentation for the Bleach project, specifying paths, extensions, project info, and HTML options.",
  "sources": "Imports 'os' and 'sys' modules; reads bleach module version and release information; accesses configuration files and static paths.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data or interacts with external systems directly; no data leaks or harmful effects detected.",
  "flows": "The version and release info are obtained from the bleach module's attributes, but only read and assigned; no flow to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Sphinx configuration file. It imports necessary modules, sets up project information, and configures HTML output. It references the bleach module to retrieve version info, which is a typical pattern. No untrusted input handling, no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Sphinx documentation configuration with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. It appears safe and purpose-driven, solely for documentation setup.",
