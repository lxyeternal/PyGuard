  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a standard Sphinx configuration script.\n- The only notable operation is importing the `bleach` library to access its version and release date attributes.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- No external data inputs, network activity, or data sinks are present.\n- The code is straightforward and purpose-driven: setting up documentation.\n\n**Scores Evaluation:**\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- Confidence is high (1), consistent with the thorough reasoning.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n- The only minor point is the import of `bleach` solely for version info. This is common in documentation scripts and not suspicious.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, typical for a documentation configuration file.\n- No changes needed in the scores.\n- The reasoning is sound and consistent across reports.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final note:**\nThis code appears entirely safe and standard. No further action or concern is warranted.",
