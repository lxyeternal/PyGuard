  "purpose": "The script attempts to open a local URL in multiple web browsers for testing or automation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the list of browser names from the TEST_BROWSERS dictionary and the URL string \"http://localhost:8080\" in the open_new_tab method.",
  "sinks": "The webbrowser.open_new_tab method which initiates a browser process to open a specified URL.",
  "flows": "The script retrieves each browser type using webbrowser.get() and then calls open_new_tab() with a local URL, potentially opening multiple browsers to localhost.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no obfuscated code, hidden data, or unusual logic. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The list of browsers appears typical for testing purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the webbrowser module and defines a set of common browsers to test. It iterates over these browsers, attempting to open a local URL in each. Error handling is implemented to catch exceptions during browser retrieval or opening. No malicious or suspicious behaviors such as network data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are present. The code’s function appears to be for local testing or automation without external data or influence.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for local testing purposes. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this script.",
