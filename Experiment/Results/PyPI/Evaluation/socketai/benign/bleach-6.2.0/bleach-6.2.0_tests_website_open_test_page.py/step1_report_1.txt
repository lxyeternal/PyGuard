{
  "purpose": "The script opens a new browser tab pointing to http://localhost:8080 using specified browser configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads from the TEST_BROWSERS list to determine which browsers to invoke.",
  "sinks": "Uses webbrowser.get() and browser.open_new_tab() to open URLs in specified browsers.",
  "flows": "Iterates over TEST_BROWSERS; each browser name is retrieved and used to open a URL in a new tab.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward with no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior. No dynamic execution or obfuscated code. The list includes common browsers, but no suspicious or malicious entries.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a list of common browsers and attempts to open a URL on each one. It employs standard Python modules and functions, with error handling for browser retrieval failures. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or command injection. The code performs a benign operation without external data sources or network communications beyond opening local URLs.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple test or demonstration script for opening URLs in different browsers. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation is straightforward, with no suspicious anomalies or obfuscation.",
