{
  "purpose": "The script attempts to open a web browser to access 'http://localhost:8080' on multiple browser configurations for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'TEST_BROWSERS' set to determine which browsers to test.",
  "sinks": "The 'browser.open_new_tab' function, which initiates opening a URL in a web browser based on the provided input.",
  "flows": "The script iterates over 'TEST_BROWSERS', retrieves the corresponding browser, and calls 'open_new_tab' with a local URL.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes only benign, predefined browser names; no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, and no obfuscated code. No external inputs or malicious behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a list of browser configurations and attempts to open a local URL in each one, handling exceptions gracefully. There are no suspicious data flows, no input from untrusted sources, nor any indicators of malicious activity. Usage is limited to local testing. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward script for testing browser opening capabilities on localhost. No malicious behavior or security risks are present based on the provided code.",
