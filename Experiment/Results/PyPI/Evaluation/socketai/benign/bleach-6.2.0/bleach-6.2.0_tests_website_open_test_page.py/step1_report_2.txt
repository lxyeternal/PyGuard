{
  "purpose": "The script aims to open a local URL in various web browsers for testing or automation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the TEST_BROWSERS set, iterating over browser names to get corresponding web browser handlers.",
  "sinks": "The webbrowser.get() and browser.open_new_tab() functions are potential sinks where untrusted or manipulated data could be used to invoke malicious browsers or open malicious URLs.",
  "flows": "Input from TEST_BROWSERS -> webbrowser.get() -> browser.open_new_tab() -> opens URL in specified browser",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The URL is fixed to localhost:8080, which is benign. No dynamic or external inputs influence URL or browser commands. Usage of the webbrowser module is standard and does not by itself indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the webbrowser module and defines a set of preferred browsers, mainly common ones like Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. It then iterates over these browsers, attempts to get a browser controller via webbrowser.get(), and opens a new tab pointing to 'http://localhost:8080'. The try-except block handles potential errors in obtaining the browser controllers. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network exfiltration, command execution, or data leakage. The code's function appears benign and primarily for local testing or automation. There are no indications of obfuscation, suspicious flow, or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward script to open a local URL in various browsers. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to serve a benign purpose related to testing or automation.",
