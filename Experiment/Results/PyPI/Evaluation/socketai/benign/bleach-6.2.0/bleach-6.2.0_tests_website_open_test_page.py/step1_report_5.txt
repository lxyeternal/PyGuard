  "purpose": "Open a local URL in multiple specified web browsers for testing or demonstration purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the list of browser names from the TEST_BROWSERS dictionary, and the loop iterates over each browser name.",
  "sinks": "The webbrowser.get() function and subsequent browser.open_new_tab() call use the browser name and URL as inputs, respectively.",
  "flows": "The list of browser names is retrieved and used as input to webbrowser.get(), which then opens a URL in each specified browser.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected. Usage of standard library functions is safe. No obfuscated code or hidden behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a predefined list of browser identifiers and attempts to open a local URL in each specified browser. It handles exceptions gracefully by printing errors. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or malicious payloads. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a testing purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for opening a local web page in various browsers. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
