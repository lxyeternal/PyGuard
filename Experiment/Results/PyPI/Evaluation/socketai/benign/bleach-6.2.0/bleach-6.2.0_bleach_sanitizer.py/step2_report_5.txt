  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or obfuscation:**  \n   All reports describe a standard, security-focused HTML sanitizer implementation. No mention of obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or malicious payloads. The code relies on html5lib and implements attribute, tag, and URI filtering appropriately.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or logical mistakes:**  \n   The only minor concern noted is the warning about missing CSS sanitizers when style attributes are present, which is a configuration issue rather than malicious. No critical flaws or logic errors are identified.\n\n3. **Scores given to issues:**  \n   All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting standard sanitization concerns rather than active threats. These seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n   None of the reports justify a risk score higher than 0.2 or 0.3, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. No active exploits or malicious activities are evident.\n\n5. **Malware score evaluation:**  \n   All reports agree on a malware score of 0, which is justified. No malicious intent or behavior is present.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they analyze the code thoroughly, noting only configuration concerns (like missing CSS sanitizer) but nothing malicious.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis—no malware, obfuscation, or high security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity or payloads detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear, well-structured, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — typical for sanitization code, mainly due to configuration issues, not active threats.\n\n### My own estimate:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores. The code is a standard, security-conscious HTML sanitizer with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the reports' conclusions.",
