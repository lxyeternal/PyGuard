  "purpose": "The code is designed to sanitize CSS style declarations by filtering allowed CSS and SVG properties.",
  "sources": "Input style string passed to sanitize_css method",
  "sinks": "tinycss2.parse_declaration_list (parsing input), tinycss2.serialize (output)",
  "flows": "Input style string -> parse_declaration_list -> filter allowed properties -> serialize back to string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code does not execute external commands or handle untrusted data beyond CSS sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports tinycss2 for parsing CSS declarations. It defines allowed CSS and SVG properties as frozen sets. The CSSSanitizer class has a method sanitize_css that parses the style string into tokens, filters tokens based on allowed properties, and serializes the filtered tokens back into a string. The process involves standard parsing and filtering without executing or injecting code. No obfuscated code or suspicious data flows are present. The code's purpose is to sanitize CSS for security or formatting reasons, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CSS sanitizer designed to filter out disallowed CSS and SVG properties. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It operates solely on sanitizing CSS input and does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification.",
