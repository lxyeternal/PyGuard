  "purpose": "Sanitizes CSS styles by filtering only allowed CSS and SVG properties to prevent malicious or unwanted CSS from being applied.",
  "sources": "Input CSS style string provided to sanitize_css method, parsed via tinycss2.parse_declaration_list.",
  "sinks": "Filtered tokens are serialized back into a CSS string; no external sinks or data leaks involved.",
  "flows": "Input style string -> parse_declaration_list -> filter tokens based on allowed properties -> serialize filtered tokens -> output sanitized CSS string.",
  "anomalies": "Silently discards @rules and parse errors without handling or warning; preserves whitespace/comments conditionally, which is standard but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code uses tinycss2 to parse CSS declarations, then filters declarations to only include those with property names in predefined whitelists for CSS and SVG. It ignores comments and whitespace unless adjacent to other tokens. No obfuscated code, external network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The filtering is straightforward and based on whitelists, reducing risk. It does not handle @rules or parse errors explicitly, which limits functionality but does not introduce security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign, standard sanitization utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CSS sanitizer that performs straightforward filtering without malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
