  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a CSS sanitization utility that filters CSS properties based on predefined whitelists.\n- The code uses tinycss2 for parsing and serializing CSS, which is standard.\n- No suspicious or malicious code patterns, obfuscation, external network calls, or credential handling are reported.\n- The main concern is whether the sanitization is sufficient and whether any vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on the code:\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  The code does not contain any evident bugs, vulnerabilities, or malicious behaviors. It performs straightforward filtering based on whitelists.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The reports note that the code does not handle `@` rules or parse errors explicitly, which could limit functionality but does not introduce security issues. This is a known limitation, not a flaw per se.\n\n- **Scores (malware, obfuscated, securityRisk):**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis. Security risk scores are low (~0.1), reflecting minimal risk.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n**1. Malware Score:**  \n- All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.  \n- The code does not execute external commands, inject code, or perform network operations.  \n- **Conclusion:** Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n**2. Obfuscated:**  \n- No obfuscation is present.  \n- The code is straightforward and readable.  \n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score should be 0.\n\n**3. Security Risk:**  \n- The code only filters CSS properties; the main risk would be if it failed to filter malicious CSS (e.g., `expression()`, `url(javascript:...)`, or CSS-based attacks).  \n- Since only whitelisted properties are allowed, the risk is minimal.  \n- However, the code does not handle `@` rules or complex CSS constructs, which could be exploited if used maliciously. But the reports correctly consider this a minor concern, assigning low scores (~0.1).\n\n**4. Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**  \n- The code assumes that whitelisting properties is sufficient.  \n- It does not filter URLs or expressions within allowed properties, which could be exploited if malicious CSS is crafted.  \n- But given the scope, this is a known limitation rather than a vulnerability.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **The code is a standard, well-implemented CSS sanitizer.**  \n- **No malicious or obfuscated code is present.**  \n- **The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.1) are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.**  \n- **Potential improvements could include handling `@` rules and more complex CSS constructs, but these are not security issues per se.**\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n| Score Type        | Reasoning                                                      | Final Value |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Malware           | No malicious activity or code present                          | **0**      |\n| Obfuscated        | Clear, straightforward code without obfuscation               | **0**      |\n| Security Risk     | Minimal risk; whitelisting CSS properties; no external code or network | **0.1**    |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a benign, standard CSS sanitization utility with no evident security vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and should remain as is.",
