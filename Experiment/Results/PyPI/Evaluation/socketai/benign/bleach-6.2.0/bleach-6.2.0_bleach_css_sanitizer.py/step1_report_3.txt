  "purpose": "The code defines a CSS sanitizer class that filters CSS properties based on predefined allowed sets to prevent malicious or unwanted CSS injection.",
  "sources": "Input CSS style string passed to the sanitize_css method",
  "sinks": "tinycss2.parse_declaration_list and tinycss2.serialize functions processing CSS tokens",
  "flows": "Input style string -> parse_declaration_list -> filter tokens based on allowed properties -> serialize sanitized tokens",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code simply sanitizes CSS properties based on predefined whitelists.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes allowed property sets for CSS and SVG. The sanitize_css method parses a CSS style string into tokens, filters out disallowed properties, comments, and whitespace, then serializes the cleaned tokens back into a CSS string. The parsing and serialization are standard library functions without malicious behavior. There are no external network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. The filtering based on whitelists is a typical security measure to prevent CSS-based attacks, with no indications of malicious intent or covert channels.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements a straightforward CSS sanitization class that filters allowed CSS and SVG properties. It uses standard parsing and serialization functions without suspicious patterns or malicious code. Overall, it appears to be a benign security feature for CSS input sanitization.",
