  "purpose": "The code is designed to sanitize CSS styles by filtering out disallowed CSS and SVG properties to prevent malicious or unintended styling.",
  "sources": "Input CSS style string provided to the sanitize_css method.",
  "sinks": "The output of the sanitize_css method after filtering, which could be used to apply styles in a web context.",
  "flows": "Input style string -> parse_declaration_list -> filter tokens based on allowed properties -> serialize filtered tokens -> output sanitized style.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code primarily performs straightforward sanitization without obfuscated or suspicious constructs. No external network or system interactions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a CSS parsing library (tinycss2) and defines sets of allowed CSS and SVG properties. The CSSSanitizer class filters style declarations, allowing only specified properties. The sanitize_css method parses the input style string, processes tokens, and retains only allowed properties and certain whitespace/comments, then serializes the filtered tokens back into a style string. The process appears safe and intended for sanitization without hidden or malicious logic. There are no evident vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or suspicious flows. The code does not handle external data outside the input string, nor does it execute dynamic code or network operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CSS sanitization utility designed to restrict styles to safe properties. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The implementation appears clean, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation. Overall security risk is minimal.",
