{
  "purpose": "The code provides a CSS sanitizer class that filters CSS properties to only allow a predefined set of safe CSS and SVG properties, aiming to prevent injection of malicious or unwanted CSS.",
  "sources": "Input CSS style string provided to the sanitize_css method.",
  "sinks": "tinycss2.parse_declaration_list (parsing the CSS), tinycss2.serialize (outputting sanitized CSS).",
  "flows": "CSS style string -> parse_declaration_list -> filter allowed properties -> serialize -> output sanitized CSS.",
  "anomalies": "The code processes CSS without any evident handling of '@' rules or parse errors, but this is not inherently malicious; it may limit functionality. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports tinycss2 for parsing and serializing CSS declarations. It defines sets of allowed CSS and SVG properties for sanitization. The CSSSanitizer class initializes with these allowed properties and provides a method sanitize_css to parse a style string, filter only permitted properties, and serialize the result. It skips over comment and whitespace tokens, and ignores at-rules and parse errors silently. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward sanitization utility designed to prevent malicious CSS injection, with no suspicious code paths or obfuscated logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a CSS sanitizer filtering properties for security. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It is a benign utility aimed at restricting CSS to safe properties, with limited handling of complex CSS features. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
