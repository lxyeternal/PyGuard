  "purpose": "Utility script to read test case files from a directory, process their contents, and output JSON with sanitized data.",
  "sources": "Reads filenames from the specified directory; reads file contents for each matching file.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON to stdout; uses bleach.clean() to sanitize 'data' before including in the JSON.",
  "flows": "Directory listing -> file reading -> data splitting and sanitization -> JSON serialization to stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; uses a standard sanitization library (bleach) for cleaning input data.",
  "analysis": "The script processes files ending with '.test', extracts data, expected output, and sanitizes input data with bleach.clean() before including it in JSON output. The use of bleach is intended for safe HTML sanitization and does not introduce malicious behavior. The code structure is straightforward, with no code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms. There are no unusual or obfuscated code patterns. The code relies on standard libraries and performs file I/O, data processing, and output formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless utility for processing test data files and outputting sanitized JSON. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks present.",
