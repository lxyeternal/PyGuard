{
  "purpose": "The script processes a directory of test case files, extracts data from each, and outputs a JSON summary including sanitized input using bleach.",
  "sources": "Reads directory contents with os.listdir, reads files with open(), and reads file contents with fin.read() and fin.split().",
  "sinks": "Uses bleach.clean() to sanitize data, and prints JSON output via print(json.dumps()).",
  "flows": "Directory listing -> file reading -> data splitting -> data sanitization with bleach -> JSON serialization and output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hidden behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Uses standard libraries and bleach for sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code reads test case files with a specific pattern, extracts data and expected output, and sanitizes the input payload with bleach to prevent injection or malicious content in the output. It generates a structured JSON report. No external network activity, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic are present. The use of bleach is for safe display or further processing, not malicious. The overall logic is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign utility for preparing test case data, with no malicious intent or behavior detected. It correctly sanitizes input data for safe output. No security risks are identified.",
