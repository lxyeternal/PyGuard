{
  "purpose": "Read test case files from a specified directory, process their contents, and output a JSON list of test case data, including sanitized input.",
  "sources": "Reads filenames from a directory (os.listdir), reads file contents (open, read), takes input directory as command-line argument.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON to stdout, uses bleach.clean() for sanitization, no external network or file modification.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument -> list files -> filter '*.test' -> read each file -> split content -> sanitize with bleach -> build JSON object -> print JSON.",
  "anomalies": "Uses bleach for input sanitization, which is a standard security library; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. The code processes files securely with proper splitting and trimming.",
  "analysis": "The script is straightforward: it lists test files in a directory, reads their content, splits on a delimiter, and produces a sanitized version of input data. It employs bleach to clean input, which prevents injection or malicious content from propagating. The flow is simple and does not involve network operations, dynamic code execution, or external commands. No malicious or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard file processing task with proper sanitization using bleach. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. It is a benign utility script designed for testing purposes.",
