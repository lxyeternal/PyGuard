  "purpose": "Utility script to list test case files, read their contents, split into input and expected output, sanitize input with bleach, and output as JSON.",
  "sources": "Reads filenames from a directory, opens each '.test' file, reads content, and processes data.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON to stdout; uses bleach.clean() to sanitize 'payload' data.",
  "flows": "File reading -> data splitting -> bleach sanitization -> JSON serialization.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs straightforward file listing, reading, splitting, sanitizing, and outputting JSON. No network activity, code execution, or obfuscation is present. Bleach is used for sanitization, which is standard and safe. The code is read-only and does not modify files or execute commands. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, benign utility for processing test files with proper sanitization. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate.",
