  "purpose": "Utility script to read test case files with a specific format from a directory and output their contents and a sanitized version as JSON.",
  "sources": "Reads filenames from a specified directory; reads contents of files matching '*.test' pattern.",
  "sinks": "Outputs JSON data to stdout, including sanitized content via bleach.clean.",
  "flows": "Filename list -> filter for *.test files -> open each file -> read and split content -> sanitize data -> build JSON object -> print JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. Usage of bleach appears safe for sanitization. No network activity or system modifications present.",
  "analysis": "The script reads files from a directory, filters for files ending with '.test', opens each file, splits the content into data and expected parts, sanitizes the data with bleach, and outputs structured JSON. The use of bleach is for safe HTML sanitization; no other potentially malicious behavior or obfuscated code is present. No data leaks, network operations, or system modifications are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward test case utility with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It securely reads files, sanitizes input for HTML safety, and outputs JSON. No malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are identified.",
