  "purpose": "This script reads test case files from a directory, processes their content, and outputs a JSON array of test case information including sanitized payloads.",
  "sources": "Reading filenames from the specified directory, reading file contents (fin.read()), splitting content into data and expected parts.",
  "sinks": "Using bleach.clean() to sanitize input data before including it in the output JSON.",
  "flows": "Directory listing -> File reading -> Data splitting -> Data sanitization with bleach -> JSON output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The use of bleach is for sanitization and not malicious. No unusual code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads filenames from a directory, filters for '*.test' files, reads their content, splits into data and expected parts, sanitizes the data with bleach.clean(), and outputs a JSON structure. The use of bleach is a standard sanitization method for HTML/markup. No suspicious code, no network activity, no data exfiltration, and no obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility for preparing test case data and sanitizing payloads. No malware or malicious behavior detected. The script is straightforward and safe.",
