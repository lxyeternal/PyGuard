  "purpose": "Provides functions to clean HTML content and convert URLs in text to hyperlinks, primarily for sanitizing and formatting web content.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'text' in 'clean' and 'linkify' functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements output cleaned or linkified HTML; no direct sinks that process untrusted data into dangerous actions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from function parameters to Cleaner and Linker instances, then returns sanitized or linkified content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Usage of standard library components and well-known third-party libraries without obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code leverages the 'bleach' library's 'Cleaner' and 'Linker' classes to sanitize HTML and linkify URLs, respectively. There are no dynamic code executions, no network communications, or other suspicious behaviors. It primarily configures these classes with default or provided parameters and calls their 'clean' and 'linkify' methods. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or hidden functionalities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a sanitization and linkification utility, relying on established libraries. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks within this code fragment.",
