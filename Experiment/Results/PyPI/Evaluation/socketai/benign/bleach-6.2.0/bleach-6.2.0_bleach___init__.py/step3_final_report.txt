{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to sanitize HTML content and convert URLs/emails into hyperlinks using the 'bleach' library.",
  "sources": "User input text in 'text' parameter for both 'clean' and 'linkify' functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions process 'text' internally; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'text' flows into 'Cleaner.clean()' and 'Linker.linkify()' methods, producing sanitized or linkified output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code detected; straightforward use of trusted libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard wrapper around 'bleach' library classes for HTML sanitization and linkification. It does not perform network activity, dynamic code execution, or contain hidden payloads. The functions rely on default or provided safe parameters. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with a benign utility. The code's purpose aligns with best practices for security-focused content sanitization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured implementation of HTML sanitization and linkification, relying on trusted libraries. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security issues are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
