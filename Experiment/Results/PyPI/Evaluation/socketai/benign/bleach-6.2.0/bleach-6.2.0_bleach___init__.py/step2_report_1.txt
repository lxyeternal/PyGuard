  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward wrapper around the 'bleach' library's 'Cleaner' and 'Linker' classes.\n- No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are identified.\n- The functions serve to sanitize HTML and linkify URLs/emails, which are standard security practices.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are evident.\n- The code relies on well-established libraries with default or safe configurations.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and logical assessments:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly uses 'bleach' components as intended.\n- **Malicious patterns:** No evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** The functions depend on the security of 'bleach' itself; no additional risky code is introduced.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:** None. The code is straightforward and uses trusted libraries.\n\n---\n\n### Scores review:\n\n| Report | Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---------|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| 1       | 0         | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 2       | 0         | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 3       | 0         | 0            | 0.1   |\n| 4       | 0         | 0            | 0.2   |\n| 5       | 0         | 0            | 0.1   |\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- All malware scores are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores are 0, which is reasonable.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n**However,** the scores are somewhat conservative, but given the evidence, they seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not perform any risky operations.\n- The functions are wrappers around trusted libraries, with no suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score justification:\n\n- All reports assign 0, which is justified given the absence of malicious code or payloads.\n- No hidden behaviors or dynamic code execution are present.\n\n---\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n\n- The reports assume the 'bleach' library is secure and has not been compromised. This is reasonable, but in a real-world scenario, verifying the integrity of the dependency is important.\n- No evidence of obfuscation or malicious intent is found.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|-----------|--------------|-------|\n| **0**     | **0**        | **0.1** to 0.2** |\n\nGiven the evidence, I would assign:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, standard sanitization code)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign, standard implementation of HTML sanitization and linkification using the 'bleach' library. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The low risk score is appropriate, and the malware score should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Always ensure dependencies are verified via checksums or signatures before deployment, but based on the code itself, there are no concerns.",
