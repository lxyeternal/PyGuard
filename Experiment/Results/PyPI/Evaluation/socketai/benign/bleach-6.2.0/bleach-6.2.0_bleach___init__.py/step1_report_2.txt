  "purpose": "This code provides functions for sanitizing HTML content and converting URLs and email addresses in text into hyperlinks, focusing on web content security.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'text' in both 'clean' and 'linkify' functions, which accept user-provided HTML or text data.",
  "sinks": "The functions internally create instances of 'Cleaner' and 'Linker' that process and output sanitized or linkified HTML content.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the 'text' parameters into 'Cleaner.clean()' or 'Linker.linkify()', which process and return sanitized or linkified content.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious dynamic code execution observed. Uses standard bleach library components without apparent malicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules from 'bleach', a reputable library for HTML sanitization and linkification. It defines wrapper functions that instantiate 'Cleaner' and 'Linker' objects with predefined configurations. These functions sanitize or linkify user input to prevent XSS and other HTML-based attacks. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious backdoors, or obfuscated code. The functions rely on well-established classes from 'bleach' and do not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or system modifications. The code appears to be straightforward and secure, with no indications of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements safe HTML sanitization and linkification using standard 'bleach' library classes. It does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. It is designed to protect against common web security issues such as XSS without including harmful or backdoor functionalities.",
