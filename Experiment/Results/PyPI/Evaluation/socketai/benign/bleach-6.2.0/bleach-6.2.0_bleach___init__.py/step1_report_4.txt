{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to sanitize and linkify HTML content, aiming to prevent malicious HTML or script injection in web pages.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters: 'text', 'tags', 'attributes', 'protocols', 'callbacks', 'skip_tags', and 'parse_email'.",
  "sinks": "The code processes data through the 'Cleaner' and 'Linker' classes, which output sanitized and linkified HTML content.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (text) flow into 'Cleaner' and 'Linker' instances, which process and produce sanitized/linkified HTML, reducing malicious content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or backdoors are present. The functions are standard for HTML sanitization and linkification. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sanitization and linkification classes from the 'bleach' library, a well-known security-focused package. It defines two functions, 'clean' and 'linkify', which create instances of 'Cleaner' and 'Linker' respectively. These classes sanitize and linkify HTML input, a common practice to prevent XSS attacks. The functions include detailed docstrings, indicating their purpose. No suspicious behavior, such as dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks, is present. The code relies on the 'bleach' library, which is designed for secure HTML sanitization. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious payloads within this module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of HTML sanitization and linkification using the 'bleach' library. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It effectively prevents injection attacks by sanitizing input HTML and linkifying URLs and emails. No indicators of malicious intent or malware are detected.",
