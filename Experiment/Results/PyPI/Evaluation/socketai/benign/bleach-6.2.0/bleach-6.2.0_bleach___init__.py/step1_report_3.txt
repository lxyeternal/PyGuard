{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to sanitize HTML content and convert URL-like text into hyperlinks, primarily for safe web content rendering.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters 'text', 'tags', 'attributes', 'protocols', 'callbacks', and 'skip_tags'.",
  "sinks": "The main sinks are the 'cleaner.clean()' and 'linker.linkify()' methods, which process HTML and linkify text, respectively.",
  "flows": "Input text flows into the Cleaner and Linker instances, which then process and sanitize/linkify the text to produce safe output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution are detected. The code relies on well-known libraries 'bleach.linkifier' and 'bleach.sanitizer'.",
  "analysis": "The code imports trusted libraries for sanitization and linkification. It defines two functions that instantiate 'Cleaner' and 'Linker' objects with default parameters to process HTML content and URLs. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or suspicious logic is present. The functions are well-structured and appear to perform standard sanitization tasks. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of sanitizing and linkifying HTML content using the 'bleach' library. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The implementation appears secure and appropriate for its intended purpose.",
