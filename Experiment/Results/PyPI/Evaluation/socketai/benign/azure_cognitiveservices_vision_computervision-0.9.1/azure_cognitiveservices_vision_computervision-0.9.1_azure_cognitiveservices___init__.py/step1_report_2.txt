{
  "purpose": "This code extends the module's __path__ for package resource discovery using pkgutil.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses extend_path on __path__ with __name__.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or cause security effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code modifies __path__, which affects module resource loading but does not involve data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern used in namespace packages to extend __path__ for resource discovery. It imports 'pkgutil' dynamically and applies extend_path to __path__ and __name__, which is common in Python namespace package setup. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious logic are identified. It does not read external input or perform any operations that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard implementation for namespace package resource extension. There is no indication of malicious intent or security risk.",
