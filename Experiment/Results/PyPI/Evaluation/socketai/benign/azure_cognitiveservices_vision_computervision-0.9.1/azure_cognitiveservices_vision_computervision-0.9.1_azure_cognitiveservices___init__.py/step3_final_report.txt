  "purpose": "Extend __path__ for namespace package sharing using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and operates on __path__ and __name__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects; the code only modifies __path__ internally.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call extend_path on __path__ and __name__ -> assign back to __path__.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard namespace package pattern in Python, importing 'pkgutil' dynamically and extending __path__ to support namespace sharing. It involves no untrusted data, external effects, or malicious logic. The pattern is well-known, benign, and used in many Python packages. No obfuscation or malicious intent is present. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately zero, with high confidence. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is unjustified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe pattern for namespace packages with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. The security risk and malware scores should be set to 0, and obfuscation remains at 0. The minimal risk score of 0.1 can be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no threat and is safe for use.",
