{
  "purpose": "This code extends the module's search path for package resource discovery, typically used for package namespace support.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' to call 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__'.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows where untrusted input could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace package support; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and calls 'extend_path' to modify '__path__', enabling namespace package functionality. This is a common pattern in namespace packages to extend the module search path across multiple distributions. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward and does not perform any network, file, or data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for namespace package support with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
