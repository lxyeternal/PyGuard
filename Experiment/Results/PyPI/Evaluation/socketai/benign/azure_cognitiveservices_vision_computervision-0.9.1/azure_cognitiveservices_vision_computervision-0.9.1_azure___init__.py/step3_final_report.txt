  "sources": "Dynamic import of 'pkgutil' module, use of __path__ and __name__ variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Importing 'pkgutil' and calling extend_path on __path__ with __name__.",
  "anomalies": "None; code follows a standard pattern for namespace packages without obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically and extends __path__ for namespace package support, a common and safe practice. No external inputs, network activity, or suspicious constructs are present. All reports correctly identify this as standard, benign code with no malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for namespace package extension in Python, with no security or malicious concerns. All reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
