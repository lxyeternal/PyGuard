{
  "purpose": "Extend the module's __path__ to include additional package paths for namespace package support.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses __import__ to access it; the only data read is the import statement itself.",
  "sinks": "The code does not directly send data to external sources or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code simply extends __path__ within the module namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with a string is standard; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkgutil' dynamically using __import__ and calls 'extend_path' to modify the __path__ attribute of the module. This pattern is typical in namespace packages to aggregate multiple directories. The code is minimal and does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior. It does not perform network communication, data exfiltration, or execute any untrusted code.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace package extension and shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
