  "purpose": "Configuration class for the ComputerVisionClient in the Azure Cognitive Services SDK",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'endpoint' and 'credentials' in __init__ method",
  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data is used insecurely or transmitted",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class attributes and URL formation, but no dangerous data flow identified",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class that initializes with endpoint and credentials, performing basic validation. It constructs a base URL for API calls and sets connection parameters. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data leaks are evident. Usage of versioning and user-agent string is standard. The code appears to be auto-generated, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK configuration class with proper input validation and no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be part of an SDK client setup without security risks.",
