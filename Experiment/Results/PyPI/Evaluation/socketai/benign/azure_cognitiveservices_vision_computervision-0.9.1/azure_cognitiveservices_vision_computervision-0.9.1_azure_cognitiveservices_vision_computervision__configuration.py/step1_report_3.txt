{
  "purpose": "Define configuration class for the ComputerVisionClient, setting up necessary parameters and defaults for service interaction.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'endpoint' and 'credentials', imported modules ('msrest', 'version')",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data flows directly to sensitive operations or external systems",
  "flows": "endpoint and credentials are stored as class attributes, used internally when making requests; no malicious flow detected",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class that initializes with endpoint and credentials, performs null checks, constructs a base URL, and sets default connection parameters. It imports necessary modules, including a version identifier, and sets user-agent headers. No suspicious or malicious activity observed, no external data leaks, or unsafe practices present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration class for a client SDK, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
