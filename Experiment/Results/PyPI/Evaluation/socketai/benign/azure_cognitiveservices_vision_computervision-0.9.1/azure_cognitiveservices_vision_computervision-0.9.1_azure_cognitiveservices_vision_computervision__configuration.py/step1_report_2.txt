  "purpose": "Define configuration class for the ComputerVisionClient, handling endpoint and credentials setup.",
  "sources": "Initialization parameters 'endpoint' and 'credentials'.",
  "sinks": "Super call to superclass constructor, setting attributes 'endpoint' and 'credentials'.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> class attributes -> superclass constructor.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration class for a client SDK. It validates input parameters, constructs a base URL from a provided endpoint, and sets configuration options. It imports external modules and version info, and adds a user agent string with versioning. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic detected. It appears to be a standard, auto-generated SDK configuration class with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SDK configuration class with no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks. It mainly sets up parameters for the client connection and includes no malicious or suspicious logic.",
