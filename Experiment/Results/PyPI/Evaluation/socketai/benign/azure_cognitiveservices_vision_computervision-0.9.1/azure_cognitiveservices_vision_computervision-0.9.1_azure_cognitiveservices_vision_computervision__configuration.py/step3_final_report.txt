  "purpose": "Configuration class for Azure Computer Vision SDK, performing input validation and setting connection parameters.",
  "sources": "endpoint and credentials parameters, imported VERSION for user-agent string",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is used insecurely or passed to external systems",
  "flows": "Input parameters (endpoint, credentials) validated and stored as attributes; URL constructed from endpoint",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns; standard SDK setup",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated SDK configuration class with proper validation, URL construction, and connection setup. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal security risk score (0 or 0.1). Given the benign and standard nature, the risk score should be 0, aligning with the analysis. No anomalies or suspicious flows are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated SDK configuration class with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are appropriate; malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0, and the security risk score should be 0.",
