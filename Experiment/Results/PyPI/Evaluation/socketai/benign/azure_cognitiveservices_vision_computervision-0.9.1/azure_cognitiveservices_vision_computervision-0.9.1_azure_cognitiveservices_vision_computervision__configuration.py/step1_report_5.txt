  "purpose": "Define configuration class for the ComputerVisionClient with validation and setup",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters 'endpoint' and 'credentials'",
  "sinks": "Super constructor call, string formatting for 'base_url', setting class attributes",
  "flows": "endpoint and credentials flow into the class instance, base_url constructed from endpoint",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious or malicious code behaviors, no obfuscated code, no external data exfiltration or network connections",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a configuration class for a client library, validating input parameters, constructing a URL, and configuring connection settings. It uses standard Python practices, external library imports, and generates user agent headers with version info. No suspicious data flows, malicious behaviors, or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign configuration setup for a client library. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks are present.",
