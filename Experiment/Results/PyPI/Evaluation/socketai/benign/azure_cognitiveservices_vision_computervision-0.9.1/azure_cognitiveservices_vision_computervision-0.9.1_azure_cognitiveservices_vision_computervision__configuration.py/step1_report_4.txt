  "purpose": "Define configuration class for Azure Computer Vision client with parameters for endpoint and credentials.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed during class instantiation ('endpoint', 'credentials').",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data being used insecurely or maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input parameters directly assigned to instance attributes after validation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code appears to be standard configuration setup. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class for an Azure SDK client, validating inputs and setting up connection parameters. It imports standard libraries, performs input validation, and constructs a base URL using a parameter. No external data is read dynamically; parameters are expected to be provided during instantiation. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK configuration class with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs expected input validation and setup for service connection. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security threats are evident.",
