  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a generated SDK or client library for Microsoft Azure Computer Vision service, defining import statements and public interface exports.",
  "sources": "The only source of input or data is the import statement for '_computer_vision_client_operations'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data processing are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is mainly import and export definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, auto-generated, and lacks any suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic. No unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module defining an import for a client operations mixin and an export list. It is clearly auto-generated, with no runtime data handling, external communication, or security-sensitive operations. It does not contain any obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns. Given its structure, it serves as a part of an SDK or library, not an executable script or malicious payload.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, auto-generated component of a Microsoft SDK, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
