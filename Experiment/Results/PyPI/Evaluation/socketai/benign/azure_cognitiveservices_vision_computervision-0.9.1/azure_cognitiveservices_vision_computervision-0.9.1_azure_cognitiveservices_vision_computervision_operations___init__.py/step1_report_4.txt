  "purpose": "This code is part of a generated SDK for Microsoft Computer Vision services, likely used to define client operations and expose them for use in applications.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing a module '_computer_vision_client_operations'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only imports and exports a class",
  "flows": "The import flow from '_computer_vision_client_operations' to usage in other parts of the SDK",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs. The file is a typical generated SDK module with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and consists of a copyright notice, license information, a comment about code generation, and an import/export statement. There are no input sources, data flows, or sinks that could be exploited. It appears to be an auto-generated SDK module, with no malicious intent or suspicious code features.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign SDK component generated for Azure Computer Vision SDK. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious anomalies, and is purely structural. There is no indication of malware or security risks.",
