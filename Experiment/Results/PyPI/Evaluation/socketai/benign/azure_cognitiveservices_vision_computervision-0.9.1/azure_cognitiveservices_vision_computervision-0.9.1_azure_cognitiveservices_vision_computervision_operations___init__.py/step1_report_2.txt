  "purpose": "This code serves as an auto-generated module for the Microsoft Computer Vision client operations, providing an importable mixin class for use in larger applications.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module '_computer_vision_client_operations'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no network, file, or environment interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely defining and exporting a class.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be auto-generated boilerplate with no unusual or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a mixin class related to computer vision client operations from a relative module, then defines an __all__ list for exports. The comments indicate it is auto-generated by Microsoft, which is typical for SDK or API client libraries. There are no inputs, outputs, network connections, or data manipulations that could indicate malicious behavior. The code is minimal, standard, and well-structured with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated module for a Microsoft SDK, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
