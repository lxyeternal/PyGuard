{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal, auto-generated SDK module for Microsoft Azure Computer Vision, primarily importing a mixin class and defining export symbols.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the import statement '_computer_vision_client_operations' and the license comments, but does not process untrusted input or external data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as the code contains only static import and export definitions.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing a class and exporting it via __all__, with no runtime data flow or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static module typical of SDK components, with licensing comments, an import statement, and an export list. It contains no dynamic behavior, network activity, or data handling. All reports correctly identify it as benign, auto-generated, and free of malicious or security-sensitive features. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0, consistent with the code's benign nature. No logical flaws or inconsistencies are present. The code's purpose and structure do not suggest any vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated SDK module with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and overall security risk.",
