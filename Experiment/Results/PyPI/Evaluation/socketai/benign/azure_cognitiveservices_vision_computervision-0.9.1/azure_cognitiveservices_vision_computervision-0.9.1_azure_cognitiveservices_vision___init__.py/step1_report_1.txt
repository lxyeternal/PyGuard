  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package resource loading, commonly used in namespace packages.",
  "sources": "The __import__('pkgutil') call loads the pkgutil module; __path__ and __name__ are standard module attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any I/O operations.",
  "flows": "The code imports pkgutil and extends __path__, which is a module attribute; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behaviors detected; the code is minimal and follows standard namespace package extension pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkgutil module dynamically and uses extend_path to modify __path__, enabling namespace package support. There are no signs of malicious activity or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and adheres to common Python package practices.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard namespace package extension pattern with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
