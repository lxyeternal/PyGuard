{
  "purpose": "Extend the current package's __path__ for namespace packaging support.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' to access extend_path method, which interacts with __path__ and __name__ variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "The code modifies __path__ using extend_path, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal; the code is a common pattern for namespace packages, with no unusual behavior or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code uses __import__('pkgutil') to dynamically import the pkgutil module, then calls extend_path to modify the __path__ variable, which is standard for namespace packages. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious functions are present. The purpose is to support package namespace extension. The code is straightforward and uses standard library functions with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
