  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a standard setup.py script for a Python package.\n- It reads version info from local files, reads README and CHANGELOG for descriptions.\n- It imports 'azure' to check for incompatible versions.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are detected.\n- The 'azure' version check raises an exception if incompatible, which is a common safeguard.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Standard package setup.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior; benign azure version check.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues found. The reasoning is sound.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Setup script for the SDK.\n- **Findings:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (very low, perhaps considering the version check)\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The minimal security risk is justified given the version check, but it's benign.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Package configuration.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code; standard practices.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (again, the version check)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Package setup.\n- **Findings:** Standard, no obfuscation or malicious code.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code is typical for setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Package configuration.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious behavior, standard practices.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a standard setup script.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is present.\n- The 'azure' version check is a benign safeguard, not an indicator of malicious intent.\n- The malware scores are appropriately set to 0.\n- The security risk scores are very low, justified by the lack of network activity or data manipulation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n**Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n**Risk Score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a typical, benign Python package setup script with no security concerns.",
