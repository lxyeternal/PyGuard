{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to configure and set up the Python package 'azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision' for distribution, including version extraction, package metadata, and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from version.py or _version.py, reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files for long description, and imports modules such as os, re, setuptools, and azure.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'setup' function to process package metadata and dependencies; no untrusted data directly influences execution flow or security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local files, then passes collected metadata to setuptools.setup for package distribution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; version extraction relies on regex parsing of local files. No hidden or obfuscated code detected. The azure import and version check are standard for package compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup and package configuration tasks, including checking for incompatible azure versions and extracting version info from local files. It reads static files for package descriptions and defines dependencies and metadata. No dynamic code execution or user input processing is present. No indicators of malicious intent, such as network activity, code injection, or hidden backdoors, are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for a Python package, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It primarily handles package configuration and metadata collection, with standard library and package dependencies. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security threats.",
