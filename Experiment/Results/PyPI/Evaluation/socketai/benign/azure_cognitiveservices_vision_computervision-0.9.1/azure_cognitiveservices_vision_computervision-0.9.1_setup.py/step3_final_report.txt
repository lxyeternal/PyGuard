  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, performing version extraction, dependency checks, and package configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from local files, README.md, CHANGELOG.md, and imports 'azure' for version compatibility check.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or dynamic code execution; static file reads and package setup.",
  "flows": "Reads version and documentation files, performs 'azure' version check, then passes data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior; the 'azure' version check is a benign safeguard.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python setup script with static file reads and a version compatibility check. No dynamic or network activity is present. The 'azure' version check raises an exception if incompatible, which is a standard safeguard. No obfuscation or malicious code is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify its safe and standard structure. The scores are appropriate and justified.",
