{
  "purpose": "This script configures the setup process for the 'azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision' Python package, including dependency management, version extraction, and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads package version from version.py or _version.py, reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files, and gathers environment and package information during setup.",
  "sinks": "None of the code writes untrusted data; it primarily reads static files and environment info during setup.",
  "flows": "The code reads version info and files, then uses this data to configure package setup parameters. There are no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs an explicit check for the presence of the 'azure' package and raises an exception if an incompatible version is detected, which is standard but might be seen as unusual in a setup script. No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. No network activity or system modifications are detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup configurations: importing modules, extracting version info from a local file, reading documentation files, and configuring package metadata. The version extraction via regex and the azure package check are standard practices. No malicious or suspicious behavior is observed, and the code does not include network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. All operations appear consistent with legitimate package setup routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It manages dependencies and metadata securely and transparently, with no suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
