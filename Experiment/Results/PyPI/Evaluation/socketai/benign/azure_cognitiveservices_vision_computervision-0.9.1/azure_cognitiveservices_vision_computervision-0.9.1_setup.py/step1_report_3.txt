{
  "purpose": "This script configures the setup process for a Python package, including version extraction, package metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads version information from a version.py or _version.py file, reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md files for long description, and reads environment (implicitly through package metadata).",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the script primarily performs file I/O and package configuration.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local files, then uses this info to configure package setup; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The code attempts to detect incompatible azure versions but does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations with version extraction from local files. It includes a check for incompatible azure versions, raising an exception if an incompatible version is detected, which is a benign safeguard. The reading of README.md and CHANGELOG.md files is typical for package long descriptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code structure is clear, and no obfuscated or suspicious code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious intent. It reads local files for configuration and manages dependencies and metadata securely. No security risks or malware behaviors are evident.",
