  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging and distributing the 'azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision' Python SDK.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from version.py or _version.py; reads README.md and CHANGELOG.md; reads environment and package info during import; uses package metadata and requirements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data is written or transmitted; no dynamic code execution based on untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Reads version info from local files; constructs package metadata; executes setup with static inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors detected. The only noteworthy behavior is the intentional version check and import handling, which are standard for setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs static analysis of package metadata, version extraction, and setup configuration. It attempts to detect incompatible azure versions and reads version info from local files. It loads README and changelog files for documentation purposes. No dynamic or malicious behaviors are observed, such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The import of azure is handled cautiously, and only in a way that raises an exception if incompatible versions are found. The code is well-structured, uses standard practices, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent. It performs typical package configuration tasks with no signs of malware or security risks.",
