  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe the code as standard SDK setup code, generated by an auto-generation tool.\n- No external input handling, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic code execution are detected.\n- The code primarily consists of import statements, module exports, and version assignment.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, indicating the code is clear and readable.\n- The security risk scores are all 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Confirmations:**\n- The code does not contain any of the typical vectors for security issues or malware.\n- The structure and comments are standard for auto-generated SDK modules.\n- No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, and no external data handling occurs.\n\n**Potential issues or discrepancies:**\n- The reports are consistent and seem accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and justified.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Given the code's simplicity and the lack of any suspicious patterns, I agree with the reports' assessments.\n- The risk scores should remain at 0 for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, as there is no evidence suggesting otherwise.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, standard code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a benign, auto-generated SDK setup module with no security concerns.",
