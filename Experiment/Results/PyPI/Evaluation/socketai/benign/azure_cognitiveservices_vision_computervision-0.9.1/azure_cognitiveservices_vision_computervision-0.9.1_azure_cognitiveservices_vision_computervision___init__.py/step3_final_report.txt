{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a boilerplate module for the Microsoft Computer Vision SDK, importing internal configurations, client classes, and version info, then setting up module exports and versioning.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_configuration, _computer_vision_client, version)",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static import and export setup only",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward auto-generated SDK setup code with standard comments and structure",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements, module export definitions, and version assignment. It contains no input handling, network activity, dynamic code execution, or data processing. The structure is typical of auto-generated SDK boilerplate, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. All signals indicate benign, standard setup code with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard SDK boilerplate with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk=0 are appropriate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
