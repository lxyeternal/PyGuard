  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine whether the issues identified are valid, consistent, and whether the scoring reflects the actual risk.\n\n**Overall Summary:**\n- The code in question is a minimal, auto-generated SDK setup module that imports internal classes, sets module exports, and assigns version info.\n- No input handling, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are detected.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- **Presence of issues:** None. All reports correctly identify that the code is standard SDK boilerplate with no malicious or security-related issues.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- **Errors or mistakes in reasoning:** None. The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n\n### Score Justification:\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports, which is appropriate given the straightforward, clear code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports. No malicious activity or intent is detected.\n- **Security risk score:** 0, which aligns with the absence of any security concerns.\n\n### Specific Observations:\n- The reports are highly consistent and well-justified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n- No report suggests any suspicious behavior that warrants a higher risk or malware score.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nGiven the evidence, the code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risk.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** (no obfuscation or suspicious code patterns)\n- **Risk score:** **0** (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is standard SDK boilerplate with no security issues. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscated, and risk scores.",
