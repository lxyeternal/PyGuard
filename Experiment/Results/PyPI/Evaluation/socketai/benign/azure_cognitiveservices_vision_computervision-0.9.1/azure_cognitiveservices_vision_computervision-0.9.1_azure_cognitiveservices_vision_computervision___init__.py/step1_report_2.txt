{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of an SDK or client library for interacting with Microsoft Computer Vision services, primarily for configuration and client initialization.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (.configuration, .computer_vision_client, .version). No external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no network or file operations in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow as the code only defines imports, variables, and exports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard structure for an SDK module. The code includes licensing and auto-generation notices, no suspicious logic or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module setup for a client SDK, importing configuration and client classes, defining module exports, and setting version info. No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious behavior are evident. It appears to be auto-generated boilerplate code typical of SDKs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign SDK module setup with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is safe for use as part of the larger Microsoft Computer Vision SDK.",
