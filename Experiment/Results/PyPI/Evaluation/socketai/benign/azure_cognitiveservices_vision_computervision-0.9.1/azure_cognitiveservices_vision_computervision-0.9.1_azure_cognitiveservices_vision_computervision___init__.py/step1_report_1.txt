{
  "purpose": "This code sets up imports and exports for a Computer Vision client library generated by Microsoft AutoRest, primarily for SDK initialization and configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_configuration, _computer_vision_client, version), and reading the VERSION constant.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; mainly module setup and version assignment.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports and exports components and version info.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs; standard SDK setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements, module exports, and a version assignment, typical for SDK or library modules. It does not contain any input handling, network operations, or data processing. The license and copyright comments are standard and do not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, benign SDK module setup with no malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports internal components and exposes them for use, with no indication of malicious or maliciously intended operations.",
