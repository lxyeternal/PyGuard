  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states the code is a legitimate client SDK for Azure Cognitive Services Vision API, with input via URL parameters, function args, and request bodies.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard API request/response pattern; no suspicious data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns observed.\n- **Analysis:** The code adheres to typical SDK design, serializing inputs, formatting URLs, handling responses, and raising specific exceptions on errors.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent; low security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** This report is consistent and reasonable. The code appears legitimate and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Reports 2 & 4:**\n\n- **Error:** \"Empty response\" with no further details.\n- **Implication:** These are likely placeholder or failed test reports with no security relevance.\n\n**Assessment:** No additional insights; no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1; describes a client SDK for Azure Computer Vision API.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Same pattern—inputs serialized, requests sent, responses deserialized.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors. The code is auto-generated, following standard SDK patterns.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious or sabotage behaviors; all data flows are legitimate API interactions.\n- **Conclusion:** Confirmed as a legitimate SDK client, low security risk.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with Report 1; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Reports 5 & 6:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar description of SDK functions for image analysis, OCR, object detection, etc.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard serialization, request formatting, response handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns. No signs of malicious network activity.\n- **Analysis:** Legitimate SDK pattern; no malicious or sabotage indicators.\n- **Conclusion:** Very low security risk, legitimate code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.95.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Code Presence & Functionality:** All reports describe legitimate, auto-generated SDK code for Azure Cognitive Services.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0, which aligns with the observed code.\n- **Security Risk:** Consistently low (around 0.1), justified by the absence of secrets, malicious code, or suspicious data flows.\n- **Confidence:** High (above 0.9), given the detailed reasoning and consistent observations.\n\n### **Final Estimations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear, auto-generated SDK, no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — minimal, justified by standard API client patterns with no vulnerabilities or malicious signs.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe provided code and reports collectively indicate a legitimate, well-structured SDK client for Azure Cognitive Services. No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk behaviors are evident. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware/obfuscated scores should remain at zero.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \nNo changes needed. Continue monitoring for any future anomalies, but current evidence suggests the code is safe.",
