  "purpose": "Metadata and boilerplate code containing comments, license info, and a version string assignment.",
  "sources": "Assignment of VERSION variable; comments and license notices.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; static assignment with no data flow or dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, auto-generated metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static metadata with comments, license, and a version string. No executable logic, data flows, or dynamic code are present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: 0) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static metadata with no malicious or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the content, requiring no adjustments.",
