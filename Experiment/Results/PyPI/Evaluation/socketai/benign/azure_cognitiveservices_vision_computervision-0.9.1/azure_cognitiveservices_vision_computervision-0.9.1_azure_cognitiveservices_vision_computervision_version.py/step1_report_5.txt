  "sources": "Constant assignment of VERSION string; comments indicating licensing and code generation.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, input, or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows, input/output, or external interactions observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or suspicious patterns; only comments and a version constant.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only comments, licensing information, and a version string assignment. There are no functions, data input/output, external network calls, or dynamic code execution. It appears to be a snippet of a generated code file header with no operational logic. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. Given the simplicity and standard nature of this code, the likelihood of malicious intent is extremely low.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is purely informational and metadata, with no evidence of malicious activity or security issues. It is a typical generated code header with license and version info.",
