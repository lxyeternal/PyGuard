  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports describe code that is purely metadata: comments, license notices, and a static version string.\n- No input/output operations, data processing, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The code is auto-generated boilerplate, likely part of SDK or library headers.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Malware scores:** consistently 0, which aligns with the analysis that there's no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** consistently 0, matching the reports' observation of clear, readable code.\n- **Risk scores:** all 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Critical assessment:**\n- The reports are thorough and consistent; they correctly identify that the code is purely metadata with no security concerns.\n- The reasoning is sound; no assumptions are made beyond the observable static code.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and align with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and well-justified.\n- The code in question poses no security risk.\n- The risk, malware, and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence scores of 1 are appropriate, given the clear, static nature of the code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the evidence presented.\n\n**Final note:** There are no issues or discrepancies requiring correction or escalation.",
