  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code snippet and considering the security implications.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is boilerplate SDK client code, auto-generated by Microsoft’s AutoRest tool.\n- The code only initializes configuration, serializers, and deserializers; it does not perform any network calls, data processing, or handle untrusted data directly.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are identified.\n- The parameters 'endpoint' and 'credentials' are passed in and used solely for configuration purposes.\n- The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, indicating no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issues in the code:** No issues are present. The code is standard SDK boilerplate.\n- **Malicious activity:** None detected; malware score is 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** None observed; code is straightforward.\n- **Security risks:** Minimal; only potential concern is the handling of credentials, but they are passed as parameters, not hardcoded or processed insecurely.\n\n### Scoring:\n- The reports assign a very low security risk (0.1 or 0), which aligns with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or above), consistent with the clear, boilerplate nature of the code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since the code is auto-generated SDK setup code, the risk scores should remain very low.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores; they are reasonable.\n- The malware score should stay at 0, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** approximately 0.1 (reflecting minimal security concern, mainly due to passing credentials)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis code is a standard, auto-generated client class for the Microsoft Computer Vision API. It does not contain any malicious, obfuscated, or insecure elements. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is safe, with no indicators of supply chain compromise or malicious intent. The current scoring and analysis are accurate.",
