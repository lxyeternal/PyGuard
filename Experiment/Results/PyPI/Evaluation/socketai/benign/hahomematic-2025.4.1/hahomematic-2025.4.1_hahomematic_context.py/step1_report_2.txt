  "purpose": "Define a context variable to track if a call is running within a service.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines a context variable with a default value.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply initializes a context variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code is straightforward and standard for context variable initialization.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'annotations' feature from __future__ for forward reference support, then imports ContextVar from contextvars. It defines a single context variable 'IN_SERVICE_VAR' with a default value of False to track service call context. There are no inputs, external data, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues are present. The code is a typical pattern for context management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation of a context variable for managing call context. No security risks or malware are detected.",
