  "purpose": "Define a context variable to track whether a call is running within a service context.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it simply defines a context variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs since there are no input or output operations; only variable definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'annotations' feature for future compatibility and creates a ContextVar object with a default value of False. It is a straightforward declaration for context management in Python. There are no malicious behaviors, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. The code serves a utility purpose without side effects or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign declaration of a context variable intended for internal state tracking. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
