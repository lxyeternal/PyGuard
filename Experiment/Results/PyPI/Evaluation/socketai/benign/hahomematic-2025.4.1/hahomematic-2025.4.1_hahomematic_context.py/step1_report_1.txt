  "purpose": "Define a context variable for tracking if a call is running within a service context.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only defines a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; no untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; only a static variable definition.",
  "anomalies": "There are no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations and contextvars, then creates a ContextVar with a default value of False, used for internal state tracking within an application. There is no input handling, data manipulation, or external communication. No security risks or malicious intent are apparent. The code is straightforward and standard for context management.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply sets up a context variable for internal application state tracking. It poses no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. It is a standard, benign implementation.",
