  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python module for interacting with HomeMatic devices, setting up logging, and handling system signals for graceful shutdown.",
  "sources": "Reads system signals (SIGINT), system output status, imported modules, and version constants.",
  "sinks": "Handles system signals (signal.signal), calls asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe for stopping central instances.",
  "flows": "Signal reception triggers the signal_handler, which logs and then stops central instances via asyncio.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors identified. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup for a Python module: importing modules, configuring logging based on output device, and setting up signal handlers for clean termination. It uses asyncio for asynchronous shutdown of central instances. The signal handler is designed to handle SIGINT signals for graceful shutdown, which is common practice. No external data inputs or untrusted data flows are present. No suspicious or malicious activity is evident in the code structure or content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module setup for a device interaction library with appropriate signal handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code segment.",
