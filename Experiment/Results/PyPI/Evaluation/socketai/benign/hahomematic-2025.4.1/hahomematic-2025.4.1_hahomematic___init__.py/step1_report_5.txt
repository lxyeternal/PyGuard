{
  "purpose": "The code initializes a Python module for interacting with HomeMatic devices, setting up logging, handling signals for graceful shutdown, and managing device central instances.",
  "sources": "Reads system signals (SIGINT), standard output state, imported modules, and global variables such as VERSION.",
  "sinks": "Signals are handled via signal.signal, and asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe is used to stop central instances.",
  "flows": "Signal reception triggers signal_handler, which logs the signal, resets the handler, and invokes stop() on all central instances via asyncio.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors detected. The code properly manages signal handling and asynchronous tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, sets up logging based on output device, defines a signal handler for SIGINT that logs the event, resets the default handler, and signals all central instances to shut down asynchronously. It also ensures that the signal handler is registered only on the main thread and when running in a terminal. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious activities observed. The code appears to be a standard setup for clean shutdown handling in an asyncio environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard signal handling implementation for a Python module managing HomeMatic devices. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The structure is clear, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
