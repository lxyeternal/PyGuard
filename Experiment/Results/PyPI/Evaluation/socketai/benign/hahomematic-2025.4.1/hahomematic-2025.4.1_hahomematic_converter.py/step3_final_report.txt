  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting hahomematic parameters, including parsing and transforming parameter values safely.",
  "sources": "Input strings for parameter values, especially those starting with '0x' for hexadecimal conversion.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write to external systems or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input strings are checked and then evaluated with ast.literal_eval, then converted or mapped to parameter sets.",
  "anomalies": "Use of ast.literal_eval on strings starting with '0x' is safe due to the preceding check; no suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward parameter conversions with proper input validation. No external network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. The use of ast.literal_eval is guarded by a string check, mitigating risks. Error handling is limited to logging, which is standard. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for parameter conversions with no malicious activity or obfuscation. The slight risk score reflects minimal concern over the use of ast.literal_eval, which is well-guarded. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured.",
