  "purpose": "Validation functions for addresses, hostname, ipv4, password, and paramset keys within hahomematic, ensuring input correctness.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to validation functions (e.g., value strings for addresses, hostname, password, etc.).",
  "sinks": "Exceptions raised on invalid input; no data sinks or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Input values are coerced and validated through helper functions; if valid, returned; if invalid, exceptions are raised.",
  "anomalies": "Minor typo in device_address docstring ('Validate channel_address' instead of 'Validate device_address'), but no functional issues.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation relying on external helper functions assumed to be safe. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The functions simply validate and return input or raise exceptions. The helper functions' safety is assumed, but if compromised, could pose risks. Overall, the code is clean, simple, and purpose-specific, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign validation module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
