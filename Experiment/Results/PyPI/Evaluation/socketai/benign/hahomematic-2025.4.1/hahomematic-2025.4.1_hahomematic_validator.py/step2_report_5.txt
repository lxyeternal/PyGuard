  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, its logic, and the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward validation module, relying on external helper functions for specific checks.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The functions perform input validation and raise exceptions if validation fails.\n- The code appears standard, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- The scores assigned are mostly zero or very low, reflecting the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is standard validation, no malicious behavior, and no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** The low security risk score is reasonable, given the code's benign nature. The malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, straightforward validation with reliance on support functions.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** Zero security risk and malware scores are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; validation functions without malicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** Consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence (0.9), but still consistent with the straightforward validation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior detected.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, standard validation routines.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Justification:** The minor security risk score reflects the potential for improper validation if support functions are flawed, but given the code's simplicity, this is acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations (0.1) are reasonable, considering potential misconfigurations or issues in support functions, but overall, the code itself is safe.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 across all reports.\n- **Risk:** Given the nature of the code, a risk score of 0.1 or 0 is appropriate; no significant security concerns are evident.\n\n**In conclusion:** The reports' scores are consistent with the code's actual behavior. The validation functions are standard, safe, and well-structured, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (or possibly 0 for maximum safety, but 0.1 is acceptable considering external dependencies)",
