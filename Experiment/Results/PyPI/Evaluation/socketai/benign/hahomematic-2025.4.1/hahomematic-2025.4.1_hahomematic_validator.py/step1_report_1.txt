  "purpose": "Validation functions for hahomematic configuration data, including addresses, hostnames, and passwords.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for validation functions such as 'value' in each function and the imported validation functions like 'is_channel_address', 'is_device_address', 'is_hostname', 'is_ipv4_address', and 'check_password'.",
  "sinks": "Returns validated data if checks pass; raises exceptions otherwise. No direct data sinks or external data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input values are passed to validation functions which verify format and content, then returned if valid or raise exceptions if invalid.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual dynamic execution observed. Validation functions rely on external validation helpers, no suspicious pattern detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation using external helper functions to verify addresses, hostnames, IPv4 addresses, and passwords. It uses 'vol' schema for coercion and range checks. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious logic. The functions are straightforward, primarily validating formats. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical validation module with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It simply validates inputs using external helper functions and does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic.",
