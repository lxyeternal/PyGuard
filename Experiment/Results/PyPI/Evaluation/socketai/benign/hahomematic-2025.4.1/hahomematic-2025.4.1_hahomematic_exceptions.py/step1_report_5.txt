{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for the hahomematic module and provide a decorator for logging exceptions in both synchronous and asynchronous functions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are explicitly read within the code; it primarily defines classes and a decorator.",
  "sinks": "The code logs exceptions using a logger; no untrusted data sinks are directly evident. No dangerous data handling or external data exfiltration occurs within this module.",
  "flows": "Exceptions caught by the decorator are logged; the decorator manages flow control around error handling but does not transfer untrusted data to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. The code's structure is straightforward, defining exceptions and a logging decorator without any suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception, standard in Python. It includes a utility function to reduce args, which is safe. The decorator logs specified exception types for functions, both sync and async, with options to re-raise exceptions or return a default value. No inputs are read dynamically; the code focuses on error handling and logging. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious network calls, or data leaks. The overall structure and content are typical for a logging and exception management module, with no indications of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign implementation of custom exceptions and an exception-logging decorator, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks.",
