{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes for haHomematic and a decorator for logging exceptions in functions, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input primarily from function arguments and exception arguments. It does not include external input sources.",
  "sinks": "The exception handling and logging could potentially log sensitive information if exception args contain secrets, but no explicit sensitive data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are caught and logged; the decorator can re-raise exceptions or return a predefined value. No untrusted data flow to external systems is explicitly present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The code appears to be standard exception and logging utility code.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes with clear purpose and a decorator for logging exceptions. The decorator handles both sync and async functions and supports re-raising or returning a value upon exception. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration. The only potential concern is that exception args could contain sensitive data, which would be logged if present, but this is a standard practice in error handling. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate utility code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward exception handling and logging utility without malicious behavior or security risks. It is well-structured and aligns with common Python practices. No signs of malware, sabotage, or suspicious activity are detected.",
