{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes and a decorator for logging exceptions in the context of HaHomematic, a home automation system.",
  "sources": "No external or untrusted input sources are explicitly read or processed; the code primarily defines classes and a decorator.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present; the code does not handle external data or perform data transmission.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code is solely for exception handling and logging.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected; the exception classes and decorator are standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception, each with standard initializers. It also provides a decorator for logging exceptions, handling both sync and async functions, with options for re-raising exceptions or returning default values. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscated code, or hidden behavior. The logic is transparent and typical for exception handling and logging modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured exception handling and logging utility with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks.",
