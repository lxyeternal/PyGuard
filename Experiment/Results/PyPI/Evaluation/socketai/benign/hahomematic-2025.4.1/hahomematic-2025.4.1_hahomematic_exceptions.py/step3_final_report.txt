  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and a decorator for logging exceptions, handling both sync and async functions.",
  "sources": "Exception class constructors and the log_exception decorator, which accesses args and function names.",
  "sinks": "Logging exception args and function name; no external data sources or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Exception args and function calls flow into logging within the decorator; no external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Potential logging of exception args that may contain sensitive data; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard utility for exception handling and logging, with classes inheriting from a base exception and a decorator that logs exceptions. No malicious patterns, external data handling, or suspicious behaviors are present. The only concern is that exception args could contain secrets, which are logged, but this is a common practice and not malicious. The code is straightforward, well-structured, and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for exception management and logging. No malicious activity or supply chain compromise is evident. The potential for logging sensitive data is a standard concern but does not indicate malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal.",
