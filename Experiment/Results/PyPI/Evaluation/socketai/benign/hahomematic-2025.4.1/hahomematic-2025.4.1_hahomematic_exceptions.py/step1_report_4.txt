{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes and a decorator for logging exceptions in the hahomematic project, facilitating error handling and debugging.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions, imported modules, and function parameters; no external untrusted data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Logging within the decorator function, which could potentially expose sensitive exception details if misused, but no direct data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "Exceptions caught in the decorator are logged; no untrusted data flows from external sources to critical sinks. The decorator handles only internal exception flow.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are detected. The code uses standard Python features and exception handling practices.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of exception class definitions and a logging decorator for handling exceptions. Exception classes are straightforward and only extend the base Exception class without any embedded malicious code. The decorator logs exception details with configurable levels and options for re-raising exceptions or returning fallback values. There is no indication of code injection, data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The use of standard library features and clear structure reduces the likelihood of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom exceptions and an exception-logging decorator, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is well-structured, transparent, and does not contain any suspicious behavior or obfuscation.",
