  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and assessing the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes and a decorator for logging exceptions, with no malicious behavior or security risks.\n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward, with standard exception classes and a decorator that handles both sync and async functions. No external data processing, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious or risky behavior is evident.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing standard exception classes and a decorator, with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The code remains standard, with no external data handling or suspicious logic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Clear, accurate; no issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** The evaluation and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines exception classes and a decorator; potential concern about logging sensitive info if exception args contain secrets.\n- **Assessment:** While the code itself is standard, the note about logging exception args potentially containing sensitive data is valid. However, this is a common consideration in exception logging and does not indicate malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 — slightly elevated risk score due to potential sensitive data exposure.\n- **Justification:** The risk score is justified if exception args could contain secrets. No actual malicious behavior is present, but the potential for sensitive data logging warrants a small risk score.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores are reasonable, given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Standard exception classes and a logging decorator; no external data handling or malicious patterns.\n- **Assessment:** The code is transparent, with no suspicious behaviors. Logging exception details could be sensitive, but that’s typical.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score reflects the potential for sensitive data in logs but no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores and reasoning are sound.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on standard exception classes and a decorator, no external data sources.\n- **Assessment:** No suspicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is typical for exception handling and logging.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** The minimal risk score is appropriate, considering logging practices.\n\n**Verdict:** The evaluation and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variations, with some reports assigning 0.2 or 0.1, justified by the potential logging of sensitive data.\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\nGiven the code and the reports, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a standard exception and logging utility, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The only consideration is the potential exposure of sensitive data via logs, which justifies the small risk scores.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (depending on the interpretation of logging sensitive info)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The small risk scores reflect standard caution regarding logging practices.",
