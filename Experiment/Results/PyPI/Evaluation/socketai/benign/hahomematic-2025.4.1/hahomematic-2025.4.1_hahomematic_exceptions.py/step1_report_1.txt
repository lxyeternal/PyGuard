{
  "purpose": "This module defines custom exception classes and a decorator for logging exceptions in the context of the hahomematic project.",
  "sources": "The code reads class definitions, exception instantiations, and a decorator function for logging exceptions.",
  "sinks": "The exception classes themselves do not process untrusted input; the decorator logs exceptions and can return a default value or re-raise exceptions. No external data is ingested or sent outside.",
  "flows": "Exceptions are created and raised within the code; the decorator captures exceptions of specified types, logs the details, and optionally re-raises or returns a fallback value. No external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms. Exception handling and logging are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception classes for various error types, primarily for internal error handling and classification. It includes a decorator to wrap functions (both synchronous and asynchronous) to catch specified exception types, log them at configurable levels, and optionally re-raise or return a default value. The _reduce_args helper simplifies exception arguments for clearer logging. There is no input/output handling of external data, no code injection, and no suspicious code patterns. The overall structure and content appear to be standard exception management and logging logic. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of exception classes and a decorator for logging exceptions, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears safe and appropriate for its intended purpose within a larger application.",
