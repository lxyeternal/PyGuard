  "purpose": "Helper functions for configuration validation, URL and address manipulation, TLS context creation, data parsing, hashing, and debugging support within hahomematic.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions such as hostnames, IP addresses, file paths, raw values, and data passed to parsing, hashing, or address functions.",
  "sinks": "Functions that build URLs, headers, or perform file deletions; potentially sensitive data like credentials in build_xml_rpc_headers and check_config, or network operations such as socket connections and hostname resolution.",
  "flows": "Input data from parameters flows into URL construction, header creation, or network socket operations; for example, hostnames/IP addresses are validated and used in socket connections, and raw values are parsed and converted; hashes are computed on arbitrary values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. Use of TLS context creation with optional verification is standard; no obfuscation or unusual language features. The code performs standard security checks, directory creation, and socket operations. No malicious network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is predominantly utility functions for configuration validation, network setup, data parsing, and hashing. It performs standard operations such as URL building, hostname/IP validation, socket handling, TLS context setup, and data type conversions. The socket functions and hostname resolution appear to be legitimate network operations, with exception handling for errors. No evidence of malicious activity like data theft, command execution, or covert channels. The functions handle untrusted data cautiously, with validation and error handling. Hashing and debugging checks are typical for such support modules. Overall, no suspicious or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It performs standard configuration, network, and data handling tasks safely and correctly. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on this code alone.",
