  "sinks": "None; no data output, network calls, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks detected.",
  "anomalies": "The code is only a docstring with no executable content, no suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a descriptive comment indicating that the module supports hahomematic testing with a local client. There are no executable statements, data handling, or potential security-sensitive operations present. Without additional code, there are no observable sources, sinks, or flows. The absence of actual logic or data manipulation suggests a very low likelihood of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple descriptive comment with no executable components or security concerns. Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats.",
