  "purpose": "This code provides a descriptive comment indicating the module's purpose for testing with a local client.",
  "sources": "There are no sources; the code contains only a comment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or handle any data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the snippet is purely a comment with no executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple docstring with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a docstring comment describing the module's purpose. There are no executable statements, data handling, network activity, or suspicious patterns. Given the absence of operational code, sources, sinks, or flows, the likelihood of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks is negligible. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately set to 0. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1), as the code is straightforward documentation with no indicators of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign documentation with no security concerns, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The initial assessments and scores are accurate and justified.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
