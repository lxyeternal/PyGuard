  "anomalies": "Minimal code; only a descriptive comment is present. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment describing the module's purpose. There are no executable statements, data processing, or imports present. As such, it provides no actionable source, sink, or flow paths. The absence of code significantly limits any potential malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this minimal code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears to be a simple descriptive comment with no operational content.",
