{
  "purpose": "Provides support functions for managing asyncio event loops and task handling, including task creation, cancellation, and debugging.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from imported modules, internal asyncio functions, and user-provided coroutines or callables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes user-provided coroutines, callables, or tasks via event loop or executor; logs debug information.",
  "flows": "Input data (coroutines, callables, task management calls) flows into task creation or execution functions; then tasks are run, monitored, or canceled; logging occurs based on task states.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Uses standard asyncio and threading constructs. No obfuscated code or hidden behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward asyncio task management helper class with functions to create, run, and cancel tasks, and a decorator to check for correct event loop usage. It imports standard libraries, adheres to expected patterns, and does not include any suspicious or malicious code segments. The only potential concern might be the use of debug logs, but this is typical for debugging and does not suggest malicious intent. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module for asyncio task management, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It functions as a supportive framework for asynchronous operations, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
