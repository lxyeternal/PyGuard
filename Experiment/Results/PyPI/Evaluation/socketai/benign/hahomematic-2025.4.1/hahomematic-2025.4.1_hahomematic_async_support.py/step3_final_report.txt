{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for managing asyncio event loops, tasks, and debugging within Python applications.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from coroutine parameters, internal task management, and debugging flags.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or data leaks; primarily manages internal asyncio tasks and logs.",
  "flows": "Creates and manages asyncio tasks and executor jobs, with internal flow from source functions to task scheduling and cancellation.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; straightforward asyncio task management with standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard asyncio patterns for task creation, cancellation, and debugging support. It uses get_event_loop(), which may be deprecated in newer Python versions but is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or network activity are present. The functions and classes are well-structured, with proper error handling and logging. The absence of external communication, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads indicates benign intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the utility nature and potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted, but no actual vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate asyncio utility module designed for task management and debugging. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are consistent with the detailed analysis, confirming a safe and standard implementation.",
