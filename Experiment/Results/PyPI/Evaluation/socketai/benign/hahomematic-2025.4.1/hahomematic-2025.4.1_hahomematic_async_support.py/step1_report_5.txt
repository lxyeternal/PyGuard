  "purpose": "Provides helper classes and functions to manage asyncio event loops, tasks, and executor jobs for asynchronous operation support.",
  "sources": "Imports external modules, class constructor, and methods reading or managing asyncio tasks, loop, and executor jobs.",
  "sinks": "Method 'run_coroutine' executes coroutines thread-safely; 'async_add_executor_job' submits jobs to executor; 'create_task' adds asyncio tasks. These could be sources if misused.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'create_task', 'async_add_executor_job', and 'run_coroutine' where untrusted inputs could trigger task creation or execution; monitored via task set. 'cancel_tasks' cancels all tasks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Use of asyncio for task management is standard; no obfuscated code detected. Logging is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Looper class managing asyncio tasks and executor jobs with safe task creation, cancellation, and monitoring. It includes mechanisms for logging long-waiting tasks, handling cancellations, and ensuring functions run within the event loop. The 'loop_check' decorator warns if functions are run outside the event loop. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present; it is a standard asyncio helper module. The 'cancelling' function correctly checks task cancellation state. No code indicates malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical asyncio helper module for task management, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles asynchronous task creation, execution, and cancellation properly. No malicious intent or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
