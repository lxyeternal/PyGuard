  "purpose": "Bootstrap installer for setuptools, downloading from remote URLs, extracting, and executing setup.py.",
  "sources": "Network URLs for downloading archives, subprocess calls for executing setup.py, file extraction locations.",
  "sinks": "Execution of setup.py which can run arbitrary code, downloading files into local directories, modifying sys.modules.",
  "flows": "Download archive from URL -> extract archive -> change directory -> run setup.py via subprocess.",
  "anomalies": "Use of insecure download method (download_file_insecure) that bypasses SSL verification, executing remote setup.py scripts without validation, always returning True for insecure download viability.",
  "analysis": "The script automates downloading and installing setuptools, supporting multiple download methods including insecure options. It extracts archives into temporary directories and runs setup.py from the extracted content. The insecure download method can be exploited if URLs are malicious, leading to potential remote code execution. The execution of setup.py from remote sources without validation is a significant supply chain risk. No malicious code or obfuscation is present within the script itself. The code is straightforward and intended for legitimate bootstrap purposes, but the reliance on external sources and insecure download options introduces security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard bootstrap installer for setuptools with multiple download methods and fallback options. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. However, executing remote setup.py scripts without validation and using insecure download modes pose significant supply chain security risks. The overall malware score is 0, but the security risk is moderate to high (~0.7), especially if URLs are compromised or untrusted. Proper validation, checksum verification, or signature validation are recommended to mitigate these risks.",
