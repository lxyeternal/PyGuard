  "conclusion": "The code is a standard bootstrap installer for setuptools with multiple download methods and fallback options. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. However, executing remote setup.py scripts without validation and using insecure download modes pose significant supply chain security risks. The overall malware score is 0, but the security risk is moderate to high (~0.7), especially if URLs are compromised or untrusted. Proper validation, checksum verification, or signature validation are recommended to mitigate these risks."
