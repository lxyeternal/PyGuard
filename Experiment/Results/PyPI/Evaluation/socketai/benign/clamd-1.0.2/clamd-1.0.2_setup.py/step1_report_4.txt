{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'clamd' Python package, which provides an interface to ClamAV daemon.",
  "sources": "Reading README and CHANGELOG files, importing and configuring setuptools, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs are present in the script.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (README.rst, CHANGES.rst) into string variables, then used in setup configuration; no untrusted data flows into dangerous functions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'ez_setup' for setuptools setup, which is somewhat outdated but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration for a Python package. It reads documentation files, sets package metadata, dependencies, and package discovery options. No code execution, external network connections, or sensitive data handling is present. The use of 'use_setuptools' from 'ez_setup' is somewhat uncommon today but not inherently malicious. There are no suspicious code paths, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical package setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply prepares the package for distribution with no indicators of sabotage or malware.",
