  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for 'clamd', configuring metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' and 'CHANGES.rst' files for long_description; imports 'ez_setup' and 'setuptools'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network activity or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Reads local files and executes setup() with static parameters; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Uses deprecated 'ez_setup' and 'use_setuptools', which are outdated practices but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The use of 'ez_setup' is outdated but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or untrusted data handling are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.1). The outdated practices do not constitute security threats but could be flagged for maintenance. Overall, the code poses no security risk and is typical for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The current scores are appropriate; malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1, reflecting outdated practices but no security threat.",
