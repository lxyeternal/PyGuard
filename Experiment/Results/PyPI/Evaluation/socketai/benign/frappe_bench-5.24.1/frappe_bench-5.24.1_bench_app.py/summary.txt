  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate app management utility with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The main security consideration is the potential for command injection via subprocess calls with unvalidated inputs, but current controls and parsing mitigate this risk. The overall security posture is low risk, and scores should reflect no malware or obfuscation, with a slight increase in risk due to subprocess usage."
