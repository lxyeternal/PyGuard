  "purpose": "Management and setup of a Frappe/ERPNext environment, including directory creation, environment configuration, app management, process reloading, and backups.",
  "sources": "File reads (e.g., configuration files, app directories), subprocess outputs (git commands, pip installs), environment variables, configuration fetches.",
  "sinks": "Shell commands executed via subprocess or exec_cmd, file writes (JSON, text files), crontab modifications, directory operations.",
  "flows": "Inputs from configuration files and variables influence subprocess commands and file operations, which modify system state and environment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess with variables (e.g., app names, branch names, commit hashes) that could be manipulated if inputs are untrusted; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard environment management tasks typical in DevOps workflows. It relies on subprocess calls for git, pip, and system commands, which are controlled within the code. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. The dynamic shell commands pose a potential risk if inputs are compromised, but in this context, inputs appear controlled. The overall structure and behavior align with legitimate system administration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment management script with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The assigned scores—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.2–0.3—are appropriate given the reliance on subprocess and system commands, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated. However, no active malicious behavior is evident.",
