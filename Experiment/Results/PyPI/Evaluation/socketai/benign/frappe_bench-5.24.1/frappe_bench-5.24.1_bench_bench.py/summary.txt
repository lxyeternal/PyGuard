  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment management script with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The assigned scores—malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: approximately 0.2–0.3—are appropriate given the reliance on subprocess and system commands, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated. However, no active malicious behavior is evident."
