  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI extension module with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The primary security consideration is the trustworthiness of the external 'bench' package, which is outside the scope of this code. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to reliance on external modules. Overall, the code appears safe and standard for its purpose."
