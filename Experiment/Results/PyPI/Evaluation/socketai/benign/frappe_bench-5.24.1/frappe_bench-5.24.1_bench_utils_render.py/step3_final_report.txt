{
  "purpose": "Provides utility classes and decorators for CLI output management, including stdout capturing and styled rendering.",
  "sources": "Reading from sys.stdout, function arguments, and module imports.",
  "sinks": "Terminal output via click.secho and click.clear; internal logging buffer.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function arguments into formatted strings and terminal display; no external data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard CLI utility module utilizing context managers and decorators for structured output. It employs external libraries (click, bench) in typical ways without any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The stdout capturing is a common testing pattern, not indicative of malicious intent. No security vulnerabilities or obfuscation are present. The code's behavior is benign, and the scores in the reports (malware 0, low security risk) are justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI utility with no malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's functionality.",
