  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of system management utilities for a Frappe/ERPNext environment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or backdoors. The low security risk score reflects the inherent risks of executing system commands with controlled inputs. Overall, the code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose."
