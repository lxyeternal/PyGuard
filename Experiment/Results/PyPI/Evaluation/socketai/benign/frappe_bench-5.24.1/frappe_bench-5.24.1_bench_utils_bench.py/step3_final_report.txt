  "purpose": "Management utilities for setting up environments, managing dependencies, controlling services, and maintaining a Frappe/ERPNext deployment.",
  "sources": "File operations (reading/writing configs, copying files), subprocess calls for system commands (git, systemctl, supervisorctl, redis-cli, npm/yarn), environment variables, user prompts.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands via subprocess, modification of configuration files, environment variable updates, file deletions and copies.",
  "flows": "Input from configuration files, user prompts, and environment variables flows into subprocess commands and file modifications to perform environment setup, updates, and restarts.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious command patterns; subprocess commands are standard for deployment and environment management.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of functions executing system commands for environment setup, dependency management, service control, and configuration updates. It uses subprocess calls with controlled inputs, manipulates config files, and performs file operations. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. Risks are inherent in executing system commands but are controlled and typical for such scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of system management utilities for a Frappe/ERPNext environment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or backdoors. The low security risk score reflects the inherent risks of executing system commands with controlled inputs. Overall, the code appears safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
