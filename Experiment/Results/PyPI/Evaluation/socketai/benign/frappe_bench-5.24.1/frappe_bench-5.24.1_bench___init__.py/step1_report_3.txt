  "anomalies": "Use of a global variable and dynamic import within a function; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic. No obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines some constants and global variables related to project configuration. The function set_frappe_version conditionally imports a utility function to retrieve the current Frappe version, updating a global variable if it is not already set. The import is local within the function, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, malicious payload, or obfuscated code. The code appears to be standard configuration or initialization code, with no signs of malware or security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard setup code for project configuration with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any unsafe operations or data leaks.",
