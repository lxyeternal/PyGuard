  "purpose": "Define and initialize configuration constants and a function to set the Frappe version for a project.",
  "sources": "Reading the string literals for version and project name; importing get_current_frappe_version from a local module; reading the global variable FRAPPE_VERSION.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data input or output points are present.",
  "flows": "The function set_frappe_version reads from an external module and updates a global variable based on a condition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward variable assignments and a simple function with a conditional update. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code declares some constants related to versioning and project name. It defines a function to update the FRAPPE_VERSION by calling an external utility function. The import is local, and the function only updates a global variable if it is not already set. There is no data flow from untrusted sources, nor any suspicious or malicious behavior. The structure is simple and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration and initialization script without any malicious intent or security risks. It relies on an external utility for version retrieval but does not handle or process untrusted input.",
