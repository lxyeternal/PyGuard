  "purpose": "Define configuration constants and a function to set the Frappe version based on the project path.",
  "sources": "Access to the module import (.utils.app) and the get_current_frappe_version function call.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data could cause harm; the code primarily sets global variables.",
  "flows": "The function set_frappe_version uses the import and global variable modification, but no external untrusted data flows into or out of the code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The function lazily sets a version value using an external utility, which appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants and a function to set the Frappe version, importing a utility function for this purpose. The function only updates a global variable if it is unset, which is a typical pattern. No user input, network calls, or data leaks are present. The import statement is relative, which is standard in Python modules. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious intent, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code serves as a configuration setup with a simple utility call to determine the current Frappe version. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
