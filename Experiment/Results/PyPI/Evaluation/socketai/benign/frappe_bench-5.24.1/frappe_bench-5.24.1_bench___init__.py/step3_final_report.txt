{
  "purpose": "This code defines static configuration variables and provides a function to set the Frappe version by importing a utility function. Its purpose is to initialize version-related settings for the application.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the external utility function 'get_current_frappe_version' during the execution of 'set_frappe_version'. The only input is the 'bench_path' parameter passed to the function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code; it does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or write sensitive information.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves calling 'get_current_frappe_version' with 'bench_path' as input, and assigning its output to the global 'FRAPPE_VERSION' variable if it is not already set.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement for 'get_current_frappe_version' is placed inside the function, which is unusual but not malicious. No other anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward configuration snippet that initializes version variables. It uses a lazy import within a function, which is acceptable for dependency management but not inherently suspicious. There is no processing of untrusted data, no network activity, and no hardcoded secrets. The external utility 'get_current_frappe_version' is assumed to be legitimate. The code's simplicity and lack of malicious patterns justify a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). The confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1), given the code's clarity and standard pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. It poses minimal security concern and can be considered safe.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.1,
