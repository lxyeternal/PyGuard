  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a straightforward set of class definitions for custom exceptions.\n   - No dynamic code, data processing, or external interactions are present.\n   - No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are detected.\n   - All reports correctly identify the code as standard exception class definitions with no malicious behavior.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident in the summaries.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Obfuscated: 0\n     - Malware: 0\n     - SecurityRisk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the code's nature.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, reflecting certainty in the analysis.\n   - No adjustments needed; the scores align with the code's characteristics.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, indicating no malware, obfuscation, or security risk, no justification for higher scores is necessary.\n   - The code is purely structural and used for error handling, which is common and safe.\n\n5. **Malware and Obfuscated Scores:**\n   - Both are correctly set to 0, as there's no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they base their conclusions on the static nature of the code.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with Reports:**\n   - The scores are consistent across all reports and with the code's content.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n- The code is a standard, non-malicious set of exception class definitions.\n- All scores are appropriate.\n- No changes or concerns are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The provided reports are accurate and comprehensive.",
