  "sources": "Class definitions and exception inheritance hierarchy.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; exception classes are not instantiated or used here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from Exception or other custom exceptions. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious patterns. The structure is straightforward and typical for defining exception hierarchies in Python. Since these are just class definitions, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The code does not contain any obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions intended for error handling. It poses no security threat or malicious intent based on the provided content.",
