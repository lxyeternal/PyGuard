  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step and evaluate the provided code and assessments.\n\n1. **Code Content Confirmation**:\n   - The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from `Exception` or other custom exceptions.\n   - No dynamic code, data processing, external system interactions, or obfuscation are present.\n   - The classes are straightforward, with no methods or logic beyond inheritance.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - Based on the code, there are no issues such as vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or suspicious constructs.\n   - The code serves as a typical exception hierarchy setup for error handling.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports uniformly state that the code is standard, straightforward, and contains no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n   - No flaws or logical errors are identified in the reasoning; the assessments are consistent and accurate.\n\n4. **Scores Evaluation**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - Malware score: 0\n     - Obfuscated score: 0\n     - Security risk: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the nature of the code.\n   - The confidence scores are all 1, which seems justified due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n5. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:\n   - None of the reports assign a risk score higher than 0.5, which is correct.\n   - The code does not perform any operations that could introduce security risks.\n\n6. **Malware and Obfuscation Scores**:\n   - Both are 0 across all reports, aligning with the code's content.\n   - No malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n\n7. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:\n   - All reports correctly avoid assumptions about vulnerabilities; they only analyze the static code.\n   - The assessments are cautious and accurate.\n\n8. **Consistency of Scores**:\n   - The scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis.\n\n**Final Expert Evaluation**:\n- The code is a standard exception hierarchy, typical in Python applications.\n- No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security issues are evident.\n- The reports' conclusions are accurate and justified.\n\n**My own estimate**:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is benign, well-structured, and poses no security threats. The reports correctly identify this and assign appropriate scores.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nAll assessments are correct. The code is safe, and no changes are necessary.",
