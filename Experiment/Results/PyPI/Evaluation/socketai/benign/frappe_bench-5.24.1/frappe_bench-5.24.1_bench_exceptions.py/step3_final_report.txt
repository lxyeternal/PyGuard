  "purpose": "Define a hierarchy of custom exception classes for structured error handling in Python.",
  "sources": "Class definitions inheriting from Exception or other custom exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data handling; purely class declarations.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow or execution beyond class inheritance.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward class definitions with no dynamic code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Exception or other custom exceptions. There are no functions, data processing, external interactions, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify the code as standard, benign exception hierarchy setup. The assigned scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 are appropriate given the static, straightforward nature of the code. No anomalies or suspicious constructs are present. The reasoning in the reports is consistent and accurate, with no logical flaws or unwarranted assumptions. The scores align with the code's content, indicating no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored. No modifications or concerns are necessary.",
