  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a larger application or system.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or data leakage points; no data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only defines exceptions and inheritance hierarchies.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward class inheritance with no unusual patterns or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in Exception classes. There are no input/output operations, no data processing, and no suspicious behaviors. All classes are simple subclasses with pass statements, serving as named exceptions for specific error conditions. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard pattern for structured error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions used for error handling, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It is safe and typical for Python applications requiring custom exceptions.",
