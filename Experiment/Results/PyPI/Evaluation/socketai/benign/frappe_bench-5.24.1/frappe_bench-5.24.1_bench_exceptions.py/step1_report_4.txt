  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling within a Python application.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be straightforward class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions; no unusual language features, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class declarations used for structured error handling. No external input, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. There are no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network operations. The class hierarchy is standard for Python exception definitions, and the code does not invoke any external systems or perform any dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard set of custom exception class definitions with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as part of an error handling framework within a larger application, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
