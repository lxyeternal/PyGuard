  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n   All reports confirm that the code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, inheriting from Exception or other custom exceptions. There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, or external interactions. The code appears straightforward and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n   The reports uniformly state that the code is benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. They correctly identify that these are simple class declarations used for structured error handling. There are no errors or logical flaws in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n   - **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of obfuscation.  \n   - **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.  \n   - **Security risk score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the code's benign nature.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n   Since all reports indicate no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks, raising the scores above 0.5 would be unjustified. The code is purely structural, serving as exception definitions.\n\n5. **Malware assessment:**  \n   No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads is present. The code is standard exception class definitions.\n\n6. **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n   The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly identify that the code is harmless and typical for error handling.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores:**  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis: all are zero for obfuscation, malware, and security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe code is a straightforward, standard implementation of custom exception classes with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The reports are accurate and consistent.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Work through this step-by-step to ensure accuracy, but based on the evidence, the code is safe and non-malicious.**",
