  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a Python application.",
  "sources": "None; the code solely defines classes and does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; there are no data flows or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected; only standard class definitions for exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception class definitions inheriting from built-in Exception or other custom exceptions. There is no dynamic code execution, data processing, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a straightforward setup for structured error handling within a larger application. No obfuscation or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of custom exception classes used for structured error handling. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
