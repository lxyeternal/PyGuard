  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions. There are no dynamic behaviors, data processing, external interactions, or code execution. All reports agree that the code is straightforward and standard for error handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate. They correctly identify that the code is purely defining exception classes with no malicious or suspicious behavior. No logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the code's nature. Since the code is simple class definitions, these scores are reasonable and should not be adjusted.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**:  \n   The risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate. The code does not pose any security threat or risk, so higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified given the code's benign nature.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   No suspicious claims or assumptions are made. The reports correctly interpret the code as non-malicious.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores with the Reports**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis. No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0** (no malicious behavior detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0** (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk Score**: **0** (no security risk identified)\n\n### Expert Recommendation:\n\nGiven the simplicity and benign nature of the code, I concur with the provided assessments. The code is a standard exception hierarchy with no security concerns.\n\n**Overall Estimated Scores**:\n- **Malware**: 0\n- **Obfuscated**: 0\n- **Risk**: 0\n\n**Conclusion**: The code is safe, non-malicious, and poses no security risk. The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.",
