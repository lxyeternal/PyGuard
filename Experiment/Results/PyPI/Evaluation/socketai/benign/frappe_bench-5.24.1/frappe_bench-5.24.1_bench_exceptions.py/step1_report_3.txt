  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in a larger Python application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class and exception definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or potential data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as the code only declares exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. The exception class hierarchy appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of custom exception class definitions, mostly inheriting from built-in Exception or other custom exceptions. There are no input reads, no data processing, and no external communication. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The structure is straightforward and typical for error handling in Python projects. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard set of custom exception class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of normal application error handling logic.",
