  "purpose": "Environment validation and import management for Python packages, specifically controlling 'gradio' import behavior and enforcing Python version requirements.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys.modules, local module imports",
  "sinks": "Potential attribute access in 'gradio' module, environment variable checks (none present), import statements",
  "flows": "Version check → Import presence check → Attribute access in 'gradio' module",
  "anomalies": "Conditional import handling of 'gradio' to prevent automatic import, use of 'try-except' to verify 'gr.Blocks' attribute",
  "analysis": "The code enforces a minimum Python version, manages 'gradio' import to prevent automatic usage, and imports local modules. No suspicious or malicious activity is detected; the attribute check on 'gr.Blocks' is a standard validation step. The import restrictions are typical for controlling dependencies, not malicious. No data leaks, network activity, or obfuscation are present. The overall structure is straightforward and adheres to common practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script performing environment validation and dependency control. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The minor import restrictions are standard and do not indicate sabotage or malware.",
