{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up environment checks for Python version compatibility and manages imports related to a module called 'gradio' and some custom decorators and functions from a local package.",
  "sources": "Reads the Python version info from sys.version_info and checks sys.modules for 'gradio'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects. No untrusted data handling or external network communication.",
  "flows": "Checks sys.version_info for compatibility; verifies presence of 'gradio' in sys.modules; raises exceptions if conditions are not met; imports specific functions and decorators from local modules.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code. The check for 'gradio' module and attribute access appears normal; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script ensures compatibility with Python 3.8+, raises an error if the environment does not meet this requirement, and manages import conditions related to the 'gradio' library. It then imports local decorators and functions. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity. It does not perform network operations, file modifications, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard environment and import setup script with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It primarily ensures compatibility and manages module imports without any suspicious or harmful behavior.",
