{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up environment checks and import certain modules or decorators related to GPU and gradio interface management for a Python package named PySpaces.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info (reads Python version info), sys.modules (checks loaded modules), relative imports from .zero.decorator and .gradio (importing local package components)",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; imports and attribute checks do not process external input directly",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; version check and module import verification are straightforward",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a conditional import handling gradio module to prevent automatic import, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script verifies Python version compatibility, preventing execution on unsupported versions. It then conditionally checks for the presence of the 'gradio' module in sys.modules and raises an ImportError if certain attributes are missing, possibly to control or restrict gradio usage. The rest of the code imports local components and exposes them via __all__. There are no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, malicious code, or backdoors. The conditional logic appears to be a standard environment setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs environment validation and manages module imports without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate part of a larger package setup, with no security risks detected.",
