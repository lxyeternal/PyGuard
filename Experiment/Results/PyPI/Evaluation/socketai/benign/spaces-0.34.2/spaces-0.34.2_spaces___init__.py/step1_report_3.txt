{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that enforces Python version compatibility and manages import behavior related to the 'gradio' library, as well as exporting certain functions or classes for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version info from sys.version_info and accesses sys.modules to check for 'gradio' module presence.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present. No external data is transmitted, stored, or manipulated in a risky manner.",
  "flows": "The code flow reads Python version info and module presence, then conditionally raises errors. It imports specific functions/classes from local modules, and defines __all__ for exports.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a check to prevent 'gradio' from being imported or used improperly, which might indicate an attempt to control or restrict certain behaviors. However, it does not perform any malicious actions or obfuscate code. The use of inline assignment with the walrus operator is a modern Python feature but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code enforces a minimum Python version requirement, which is standard practice. It attempts to prevent the 'gradio' module from being imported by checking sys.modules and raising an ImportError if certain attributes are missing, potentially to restrict its use or control how 'gradio' is handled. It imports specific classes/functions from local modules and defines an export list. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No external communication, cryptographic misuse, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, primarily enforcing version constraints and managing module import behavior, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
