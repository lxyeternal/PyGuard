  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is straightforward, involving environment checks, import management, and module attribute validation.\n- No external network activity, data handling, or obfuscated/malicious code is present.\n- The checks for 'gradio' are standard for managing optional dependencies or controlling import behavior.\n- The version enforcement is typical for compatibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** No suspicious activity; purely environment setup.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear.\n- **Security risk:** 0 — no risks identified.\n- **Confidence:** 1 — high certainty.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on controlling 'gradio' import.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minor concern about 'preventing 'gradio' from importing' but not malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9 — high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable. The minor security risk score seems appropriate given the control over 'gradio' import, but nothing malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same core logic, emphasizing environment validation and import control.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious intent.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — again, the import control could be seen as restrictive but not malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on environment validation, with a note that 'gr.Blocks' access could trigger code in 'gradio'.\n- **Potential concern:** Accessing 'gr.Blocks' could execute code if 'gradio' is malicious, but given the context, it's a standard attribute check.\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — the attempt to verify 'gr.Blocks' could be a vector for executing code if 'gradio' is malicious, but in this context, it's just an attribute check.\n- **Confidence:** 1.\n\n**Verdict:** Slightly cautious but still reasonable. The risk score is acceptable given the context.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar environment validation and import management.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 — minor, related to import suppression.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scoring and risk assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is appropriate; no malicious code or behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, code is clear.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports due to import control measures, but these are not malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n### **Final expert assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minor concern over import control, but not indicative of security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard environment and dependency management script, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The minor security risk scores are justified given the import restrictions but do not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign and typical for package setup and environment validation.",
