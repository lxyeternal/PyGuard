  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code to verify the claims, assess the logic, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code performs environment checks for Python version >= 3.8.\n- It manages the import of 'gradio', including a conditional check to prevent automatic import or usage.\n- It imports local modules related to GPU and gradio wrapping.\n- There are no signs of data leaks, external network activity, or obfuscated/malicious code.\n- The logic is straightforward, with standard practices for environment validation and import management.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n**Summary:** No malicious activity, straightforward environment setup.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0. The confidence is high (1).\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n**Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on preventing 'gradio' import, possibly to restrict its use.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The check for 'gradio' in sys.modules and raising ImportError if certain attributes are missing is standard for controlling module behavior, not malicious. The securityRisk score of 0.1 is appropriate, considering it might be a measure to restrict 'gradio' usage, but not inherently risky.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n**Summary:** Same as above, with emphasis on environment validation and import control.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent. No malicious activity. The logic is standard.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n**Summary:** Focuses on environment validation, 'gradio' import check, and the 'try-except' around 'gr.Blocks'.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=1.\n\n**Assessment:** The 'try-except' is a typical pattern to verify attribute existence, not malicious. The securityRisk is low, and the confidence is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n**Summary:** Similar to previous, with detailed explanation about dependency management.\n\n**Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** Fully consistent with the code. No suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Evaluation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 is appropriate; code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Given the checks for 'gradio' and environment validation, a low risk score of 0.1 is reasonable, as these are standard practices, not vulnerabilities or attack vectors.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**  \nThe scores assigned seem appropriate and consistent with the code. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to environment checks and import controls, which are standard but could potentially interfere with 'gradio' if misused)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent. The scores assigned by the reports are accurate and justified. No further action needed.",
