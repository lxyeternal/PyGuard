  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the reported issues, their reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily about environment checks, module import management, and controlling behavior related to 'gradio' and GPU decorators.\n- No report indicates any actual malicious activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation.\n- The code is straightforward, with standard practices like version checks and import validation.\n- The 'malware' scores are all zero, consistent with the analysis.\n- The 'securityRisk' scores are very low (0.1), which seems appropriate given the lack of malicious behavior but acknowledging potential for misuse of import control.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code matches the descriptions: no suspicious logic, no data leaks, no external network activity.\n- The only \"anomaly\" is the conditional import handling of 'gradio' which, while somewhat unusual, is not malicious.\n- No issues are present that would warrant a higher malware or risk score.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes:\n- No logical errors or security flaws are evident.\n- The 'try-except' around 'gr.Blocks' is a standard way to verify module contents, not suspicious.\n- The version check is standard.\n\n### Scoring review:\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1) are reasonable.\n- Since there's no malicious activity, scores should remain low.\n\n### Risk justification:\n- The minimal risk score of 0.1 is justified, as the code could potentially be misused if someone injects malicious code into the 'gradio' module or the local modules it imports, but as-is, there's no evidence of such.\n\n### Malware considerations:\n- No malicious behavior is detected; the malware score should remain 0.\n\n### Assumptions and claims:\n- All claims are based on straightforward code analysis; no unwarranted assumptions are made.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, standard environment validation)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a standard environment and import management script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should remain as they are.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the evidence provided.",
