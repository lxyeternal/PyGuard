{
  "purpose": "This code attempts to import the tqdm library for progress bar functionality and defines a function to remove multiprocessing locks from tqdm if present.",
  "sources": "The code reads the tqdm library via import, specifically calling get_lock() on tqdm if it is successfully imported.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with tqdm's internal lock object, particularly modifying its locks attribute to remove multiprocessing locks.",
  "flows": "Import tqdm -> Check if tqdm is available -> If available, access tqdm's lock via get_lock() -> Remove any multiprocessing lock objects from tqdm's lock list.",
  "anomalies": "The code modifies internal tqdm lock mechanisms by removing multiprocessing locks, which could potentially affect thread safety or process synchronization. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by attempting to import tqdm, a progress bar library, with a fallback if not installed. It then defines a function to remove multiprocessing locks from tqdm's internal lock object, specifically targeting locks of class 'TqdmDefaultWriteLock'. The purpose appears to be to modify tqdm's locking behavior, possibly to prevent conflicts in multiprocessing environments. The code does not contain any hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity. It only interacts with tqdm's internal locking mechanism, which could potentially affect the thread safety of progress bars in multiprocessing scenarios. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are detected. The overall structure is straightforward and intended for a specific fix or workaround.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility to modify tqdm's internal locks, likely to address concurrency issues in multiprocessing. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this code alone.",
