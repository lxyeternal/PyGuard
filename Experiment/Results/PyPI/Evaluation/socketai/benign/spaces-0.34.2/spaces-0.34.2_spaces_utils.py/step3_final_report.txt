  "purpose": "Utility functions for system introspection, process management, JWT decoding, and environment handling.",
  "sources": "Reading '/proc/self/cgroup', decoding JWT tokens, calling libc functions via ctypes, importing modules.",
  "sinks": "Base64 decoding in jwt_payload, ctypes.CDLL call to 'malloc_trim', reading system files.",
  "flows": "JWT payload extraction and decoding, system info retrieval, memory trimming calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscation, raising generic exception without message in 'self_cgroup_device_path'.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of benign utility functions used for system info, queue management, JWT decoding, and memory management. No malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Use of ctypes and reading from system files are standard practices. JWT decoding does not include validation but is typical in utility contexts. Exception handling is minimal but not malicious. Overall, the code is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and risk score of 0.2 are appropriate and justified given the system interactions. No modifications are necessary.",
