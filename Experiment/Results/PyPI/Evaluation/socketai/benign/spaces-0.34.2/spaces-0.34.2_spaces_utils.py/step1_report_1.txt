  "purpose": "Provides utility functions and classes for system introspection, multiprocessing, and request handling, along with some runtime environment adjustments.",
  "sources": "Reads from /proc/self/cgroup, environment variables, and imports external modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe base64 decoding in jwt_payload; use of ctypes to call libc functions; reading system files.",
  "flows": "jwt_payload reads the token string, decodes payload, and loads JSON; self_cgroup_device_path reads system cgroup info.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected. Usage of ctypes to invoke libc functions could be risky if misused, but here it's for malloc_trim. No obfuscated code present. The jwt_payload function decodes tokens, which could be misused if tokens are malicious or untrusted.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides utility functions for system info, multiprocessing, and token decoding. The self_cgroup_device_path reads system files; jwt_payload decodes JWT tokens. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration observed. The use of ctypes to call libc appears benign in context. No hardcoded secrets or credential theft mechanisms are present. The code's behavior is consistent with legitimate utility functions. However, jwt_payload handling untrusted tokens could be misused if inputs are malicious, but this is typical in JWT handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard utility code with no clear malicious intent or malicious behaviors detected. Its functions could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but as-is, it does not contain malware or security risks. The use of ctypes is safe here given the context.",
