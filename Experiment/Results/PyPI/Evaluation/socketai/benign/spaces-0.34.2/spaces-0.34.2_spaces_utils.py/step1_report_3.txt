  "purpose": "Utility module providing functions for process management, queue handling, environment detection, and cryptographic data processing.",
  "sources": "Reads from '/proc/self/cgroup' file, import modules, and processes a JWT token string.",
  "sinks": "Base64 decoding of JWT payload, no direct data sink involved, only internal processing.",
  "flows": "Reads system cgroup data -> processes JWT token string -> decodes base64 payload.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets or credentials; no malicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs system introspection by reading '/proc/self/cgroup', manages multiprocessing queues with error handling, and decodes JWT payloads. All modules used are standard, and there are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Exception handling is conventional. No obfuscation or suspicious code constructs are present. Functions appear to serve legitimate purposes related to system and data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility module with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It performs system introspection, queue management, and JWT decoding securely and transparently.",
