{
  "purpose": "Manages GPU worker processes, integrates with Gradio, handles task scheduling, serialization, and process management.",
  "sources": "Queues for parameters and results, environment variables, process connections, and external modules like psutil and tqdm.",
  "sinks": "Potential data serialization points, process communication channels, and environment variables; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Source data flows from task arguments and environment info into worker processes via queues; results flow back through queues to the main process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation detected. Use of 'import *' from types is a style concern but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code manages GPU worker processes with robust exception handling, resource cleanup, and process lifecycle management. It uses standard multiprocessing and threading techniques, with serialization via pickle, which is typical for IPC but warrants caution if inputs are untrusted. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or sabotage features are present. The code's structure and behavior are consistent with legitimate GPU task orchestration systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured implementation for GPU task management, process control, and Gradio integration. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or backdoors are evident. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and risk score (0.2) are justified based on the analysis.",
