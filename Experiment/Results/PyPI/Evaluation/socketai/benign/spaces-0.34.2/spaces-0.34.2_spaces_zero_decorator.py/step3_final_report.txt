{
  "purpose": "Implements a decorator 'GPU' to mark functions for GPU execution, with environment validation, caching, and reporting.",
  "sources": "Reads function definitions, optional 'duration' parameter, environment variables, and configuration flags.",
  "sinks": "Calls to 'client.startup_report()' and function wrappers, which may involve network activity for reporting purposes.",
  "flows": "Decorator receives a function, performs environment checks, caches decorated functions, and calls reporting before wrapping the function with appropriate wrappers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns. External reporting call is standard telemetry, not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-structured GPU decorator with environment validation, caching, and reporting. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. External calls are typical for telemetry. The cache management and version checks are standard. The external 'client.startup_report()' could involve network activity but is consistent with reporting practices. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, safe, and free from supply chain security issues. The external reporting is standard telemetry, not malicious. The assigned scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
