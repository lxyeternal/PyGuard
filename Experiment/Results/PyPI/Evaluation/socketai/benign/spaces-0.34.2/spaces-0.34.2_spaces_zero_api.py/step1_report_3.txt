{
  "purpose": "This code implements an API client for interacting with a scheduling service, including handling server-sent events, scheduling tasks, and managing tokens.",
  "sources": "HTTP responses from the server, including headers, response text, and JSON data.",
  "sinks": "Returning parsed data to calling functions, including server-sent events and JSON responses, which could potentially contain malicious data if the server is compromised.",
  "flows": "HTTP response data (headers and body) flow into parsing functions (sse_parse, res.json()), which process and return structured data to the client methods (schedule, get_queue_size).",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'assert_never' on response status, which might lead to unhandled cases; no apparent hardcoded credentials or suspicious strings; no obfuscated code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward API client using httpx to communicate with a scheduling backend. It handles server-sent events with appropriate parsing and streams data accordingly. Response data is parsed via Pydantic models, which are standard and safe. The code properly closes streams in exceptions, and there are no signs of malicious payloads or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data are evident. The use of 'assert_never' for response status is a good safety measure but could lead to unhandled cases if new status codes are introduced.\nOverall, the code appears to be well-structured, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident based on the provided source.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard API client with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It properly handles server communication, streaming, and response parsing. No malicious or suspicious code elements are present. The overall security risk is low.",
