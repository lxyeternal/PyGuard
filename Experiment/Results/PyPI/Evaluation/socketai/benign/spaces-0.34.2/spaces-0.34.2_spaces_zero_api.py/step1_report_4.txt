{
  "purpose": "This code implements a client interface for interacting with an API server related to scheduling and resource management, including handling event streams and managing queue states.",
  "sources": "HTTP response streams (`res.iter_text()`) and response JSON data (`res.json()`).",
  "sinks": "Potentially malicious data could be parsed or executed if the server responses are malicious, but the code mainly processes data without executing it. The parsing functions handle event data and JSON responses.",
  "flows": "HTTP responses are received and parsed through `sse_parse`, `sse_stream`, and JSON deserialization in `schedule` and `get_queue_size`. Data flows from server responses to in-memory objects, with no untrusted code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded secrets or backdoors. The code properly handles response types and errors. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. The only minor concern is reliance on server headers and response data, but that is standard for API clients.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a client wrapper around an HTTP API, handling POST and GET requests, processing server-sent events, and managing scheduling metadata. It does not include code injection, remote code execution, or malicious payloads. The response parsing is straightforward, and no obfuscated or suspicious language features are present. The only notable aspect is that the functions depend on server responses, but this is typical and does not suggest malicious intent. The code maintains proper separation of concerns and secure handling of response data.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard API client with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It handles data safely, with proper response parsing and error handling. There are no indicators of malware or security risks within this module.",
