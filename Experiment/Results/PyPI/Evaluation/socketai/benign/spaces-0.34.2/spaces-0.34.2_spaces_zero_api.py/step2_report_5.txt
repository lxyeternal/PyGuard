  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and the consistency of the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as an API client for resource scheduling, with data sources from HTTP responses and parameters.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code handles streaming, response parsing, and status codes appropriately.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that the code is straightforward and safe is justified, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0, and security risk is low (0.2).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The reasoning aligns with the code. The scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar understanding, noting that data comes from server responses, headers, and JSON.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious payloads or suspicious behavior. The use of `assert_never()` is a safety measure, not suspicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The assessment that the code is a standard API client with low risk and no malware is justified. Scores are consistent.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The analysis is sound and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as an API client with event streaming.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The use of `assert_never()` is a safety check.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is deemed safe, with a low security risk and malware score of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The reasoning and scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately notes the code's function as an API client handling server-sent events.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation. Proper handling of responses and streams.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is considered safe, with a low security risk and malware score of 0.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The reasoning aligns with the code.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as an API client for scheduling and token management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious patterns, secrets, or obfuscation. Standard usage of libraries.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** High confidence (1), and the assessment of no malicious behavior and low security risk is justified.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues. The reasoning and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Code Presence of Issues:** None detected across all reports.\n- **Errors or Flaws in Logic:** None identified; all reports correctly interpret the code as a standard API client.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are all 0, which is consistent with the analysis. Security risk scores are low, reflecting the lack of suspicious activity.\n- **Potential for Malicious Behavior:** None evident. The code handles server responses and streaming safely, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.\n- **Assumptions & Claims:** All claims about the code's behavior are based on the code's actual structure and behavior, not assumptions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** I agree with the assigned 0 across all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the code's nature and analysis, a low risk score (~0.2 or lower) is justified.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with the reports)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are thorough, accurate, and justified. The code appears safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the scores reflect this appropriately.",
