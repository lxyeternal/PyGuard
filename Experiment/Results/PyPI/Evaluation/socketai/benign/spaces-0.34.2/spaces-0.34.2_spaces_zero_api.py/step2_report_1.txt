  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, potential vulnerabilities, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code is an API client for resource scheduling, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is straightforward, using standard libraries (`httpx`, `pydantic`).\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code.\n- Response handling is proper, with no signs of malicious payloads.\n- The security risk score of 0.2 seems conservative but acceptable given the network interactions.\n\n**Verdict:** The report's scores are reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, a standard API client with safe handling of server responses.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Response parsing and streaming are handled correctly.\n- No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, a typical API client, handling server responses and streaming data securely.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No evidence of malicious code.\n- Proper handling of server data.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious logic.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, standard API client for scheduling, with safe data handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No malicious indicators.\n- Response handling is standard.\n- No obfuscated or suspicious code.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** A typical API client with no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic.\n- Uses standard practices.\n- No suspicious network activity or code execution.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports are 0, which aligns with the code's straightforward, non-malicious nature.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** Slightly conservative at 0.2 in most reports, justified by the network interactions, but overall low risk.\n\n### Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 to 0.2 (consistent with the reports and the code's nature)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate. The code is a standard, well-structured API client with no malicious intent or security flaws evident from the provided snippet.",
