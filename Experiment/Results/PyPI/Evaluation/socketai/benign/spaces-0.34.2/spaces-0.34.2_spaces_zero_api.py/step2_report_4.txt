  "review": "Let's analyze the reports systematically, considering the code, the logic, and the provided scores.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- It is an API client for a scheduling/resource management system.\n- Handles server responses, including server-sent events (SSE).\n- Uses standard libraries (`httpx`, `pydantic`).\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns.\n- Properly manages response statuses, streaming, and parsing.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Observations:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - The code appears well-structured, with proper handling of streaming responses, status codes, and response parsing.\n   - The `assert_never()` usage on response status is a good safety measure but could lead to unhandled cases if new status codes are introduced; however, this is not a security flaw but a potential robustness concern.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs.\n   - No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n   - The response handling and data flow are standard for an API client.\n\n2. **Malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores:**\n   - All reports assign malware and obfuscated scores as 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n   - Security risk scores are low (around 0.2), justified by the fact that the code interacts with external services and processes data, but no malicious activity is evident.\n\n3. **Potential issues or assumptions:**\n   - The use of `assert_never()` could cause unhandled exceptions if new status codes are introduced. While not malicious, this could be a robustness concern.\n   - The code relies on server responses; if the server is compromised, malicious payloads could be delivered, but this is typical for client code and not a vulnerability in the client itself.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations & Justifications:\n\n- **Scores for malware and obfuscated code:**  \n  The current scores of 0 are appropriate; no malicious or obfuscated code is present.\n\n- **Security risk score (~0.2):**  \n  Slightly elevated due to reliance on external responses and headers, but overall justified given the context.\n\n- **Risk score (>0.5):**  \n  No, the scores are consistent with the analysis. The code does not exhibit behavior typical of malware or malicious sabotage.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **The code is a standard, well-structured API client.**  \n- **No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.**  \n- **The response parsing, streaming, and error handling are appropriate.**  \n- **Potential robustness issue with `assert_never()` is not a security concern but worth noting.**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Malware | Obfuscated | Risk |\n|---|---|---|\n| **0** | **0** | **0.2** |\n\nThese align with the current reports and are justified by the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe provided reports are accurate. The code is safe, with no malicious or obfuscated elements, and the scores are appropriate. The only minor concern is the `assert_never()` which could be improved for robustness but does not impact security.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores; they are reasonable and justified. No changes needed.",
