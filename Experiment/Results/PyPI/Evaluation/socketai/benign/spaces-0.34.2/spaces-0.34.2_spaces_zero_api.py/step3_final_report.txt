{
  "purpose": "This code implements an API client for resource scheduling, handling server responses, including server-sent events, and managing tokens and queue information.",
  "sources": "HTTP response headers, response JSON payloads, function parameters such as cgroup_path, token, allow_token, and pid.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted data is improperly handled, but the code only processes server responses; no direct sinks for untrusted input are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from server responses through parsing functions (sse_parse, sse_stream) into structured models; request parameters flow from function arguments into HTTP requests; headers are read from responses for metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns detected; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs. Use of 'assert_never' on status codes is a safety check, not an anomaly.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client using standard libraries (httpx, pydantic). It handles responses safely, parses server-sent events, and manages streaming data appropriately. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security flaws are evident. The response handling, including status code checks and header parsing, aligns with best practices. The use of 'assert_never' could be improved for robustness but does not pose a security risk. Overall, the code's logic and structure are sound, with low security risk and no malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a well-structured, standard API client with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.2) are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
