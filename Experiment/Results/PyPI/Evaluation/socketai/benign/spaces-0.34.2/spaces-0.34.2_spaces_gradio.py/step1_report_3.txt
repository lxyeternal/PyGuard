{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to toggle a global configuration for auto-wrapping tasks in a Gradio interface and a decorator to conditionally wrap functions with GPU support.",
  "sources": "Configuration import from '.config', the global variable 'gradio_auto_wrap_enabled', and the 'task' parameter passed to 'gradio_auto_wrap'.",
  "sinks": "The 'GPU' decorator wrapping the 'task' function, which may potentially modify or enhance the function for GPU acceleration.",
  "flows": "If 'gradio_auto_wrap_enabled' is True and 'task' is callable, the 'task' is wrapped with 'GPU'. Otherwise, the original 'task' is returned unmodified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. The use of global variables for configuration toggling and straightforward decorator wrapping are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a configuration flag for auto-wrapping functions for Gradio. It provides functions to enable or disable this feature via global state. The 'gradio_auto_wrap' function, when called with a task, conditionally wraps the task with a 'GPU' decorator if enabled. The code relies on external modules for configuration and GPU handling but does not include any malicious code or backdoors. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious data exfiltration, or harmful side effects. The code's behavior appears to be standard and intended for performance optimization or interface management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a utility for conditional function wrapping with GPU support based on configuration flags. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
