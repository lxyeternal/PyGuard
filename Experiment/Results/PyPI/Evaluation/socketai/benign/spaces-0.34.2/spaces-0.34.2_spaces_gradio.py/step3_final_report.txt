{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions to toggle a global flag controlling whether tasks are wrapped with a GPU decorator, enabling or disabling GPU acceleration support.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from the external Config module; checks if the task is callable.",
  "sinks": "Wraps the task with GPU decorator if conditions are met; no external data sinks or network operations involved.",
  "flows": "Checks global flag, verifies task callability, then applies GPU wrapper if enabled.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; straightforward implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code manages a global feature toggle for GPU wrapping, providing functions to enable or disable it. The main function conditionally wraps a given task with a GPU decorator based on the toggle. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious external calls are present. External modules 'Config' and 'GPU' are assumed benign; the code itself is simple and clear. The security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the trustworthiness of external modules. No vulnerabilities or obfuscation are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for managing GPU acceleration toggling with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal external dependency concerns.",
