  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Provides functions to toggle a global flag `gradio_auto_wrap_enabled`.\n- Provides a decorator-like function `gradio_auto_wrap` that, if enabled and given a callable task, wraps it with `GPU`.\n- Uses external modules: `.config` for configuration, `.zero.decorator` for `GPU`.\n- No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious function calls.\n- Behavior appears straightforward: feature toggle for GPU acceleration.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Benign, explains the toggle and wrapping.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no backdoors, no suspicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is simple and benign.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, explaining the utility.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Also accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same utility, with detailed explanation.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, standard practices.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (very low, possibly considering the external GPU decorator)\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score due to the external `GPU` decorator, but since the code only wraps functions and there's no evidence of malicious behavior, this is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Utility for feature toggle and GPU wrapping.\n- **Findings:** No malicious code, straightforward logic.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Standard utility for toggling GPU wrapping.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (again, due to external modules)\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious intent or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Judgment:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None. No backdoors, no data exfiltration, no suspicious external calls.\n- **Use of external modules (`Config`, `GPU`):** Common in such contexts; no evidence they are malicious.\n- **Behavior:** Simple feature toggle with conditional wrapping; benign.\n- **Obfuscation:** Not present.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0.\n- **Security risk:** Overall very low, mostly 0 or 0.1, which is reasonable given the context.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n- The slight increase in security risk score (0.1) in some reports due to external modules is acceptable, but it should be clarified that these modules are trusted or standard.\n\n---\n\n### **My Final Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.05** — very low, considering the external modules are trusted; no security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\nThe code is a benign utility for managing GPU acceleration feature toggling. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The current scores in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep malware at 0, obfuscated at 0, and risk at approximately 0.05 to reflect minimal security concerns.",
