{
  "purpose": "The code provides decorators and functions to control automatic wrapping of tasks with GPU support and manages a configuration flag for this feature.",
  "sources": "Configuration import from .config, function parameters (task), global variable gradio_auto_wrap_enabled, and imported GPU decorator.",
  "sinks": "The GPU decorator could potentially alter or enhance the behavior of the task function; no other sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "The flag gradio_auto_wrap_enabled influences whether the GPU decorator is applied to the task function, which is returned as the wrapped task.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports configuration and GPU decorator modules, defines a global flag, and provides functions to enable or disable automatic GPU wrapping. The gradio_auto_wrap function conditionally applies the GPU decorator based on the flag and whether the task is callable. There is no evidence of malicious code or suspicious behavior; the code manages a simple feature toggle and decorator application without any hidden or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for managing GPU-based task wrapping with a configuration toggle. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
