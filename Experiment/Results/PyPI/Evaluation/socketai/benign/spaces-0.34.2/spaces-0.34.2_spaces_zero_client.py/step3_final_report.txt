{
  "purpose": "This code manages GPU scheduling, token handling, and API interactions within a web interface, primarily for resource allocation and user notifications.",
  "sources": "Request headers, environment variables, API responses, JWT tokens.",
  "sinks": "API calls via httpx, JWT decoding, warnings/errors, UI content rendering.",
  "flows": "Token extraction from headers -> JWT decoding -> API requests -> Response handling -> Errors/warnings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of verify=False in httpx.Client, which disables SSL verification; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client for GPU resource management with proper error handling and token management. The only security concern is the use of verify=False in the HTTP client, which can be exploited in untrusted environments but is a common configuration in controlled settings. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The logic aligns with resource scheduling and quota management, with no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate and does not contain malicious behavior. The primary security issue is the insecure SSL verification setting, which should be addressed but does not indicate malicious intent. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2 due to the SSL verification configuration.",
