  "purpose": "Configuration loader for ZeroGPU settings based on environment variables, with validation to ensure required parameters are set when features are enabled.",
  "sources": "Environment variables: 'SPACES_ZERO_GPU', 'SPACES_ZERO_DEVICE_API_URL', 'SPACES_GRADIO_AUTO_WRAP', 'ZERO_GPU_PATCH_TORCH_DEVICE', 'ZEROGPU_V2', 'ZEROGPU_OFFLOAD_DIR'",
  "sinks": "None; the code only reads environment variables and performs validation without external data output or network activity",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read as sources; the validation assertion acts as a control; no malicious or unsafe data flows are present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard environment variable handling and a simple assertion for configuration correctness",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables to configure ZeroGPU features, converting certain variables to booleans, setting a default directory, and asserting that if zero_gpu is enabled, the API URL must be provided. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The logic is simple and safe, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2). The assertion enforces proper configuration but does not introduce security concerns. The environment variables are used in a typical manner, and no external or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup with validation, presenting no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and appropriate, reflecting the code's straightforward and safe nature.",
