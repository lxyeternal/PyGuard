  "flows": [
    "Environment variables are read during class instantiation.",
    "The 'assert' statement enforces the presence of 'SPACES_ZERO_DEVICE_API_URL' if 'SPACES_ZERO_GPU' is true."
  ],
  "anomalies": "The code appears to perform standard configuration loading. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are present. No malicious activity or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Settings class that reads configuration options from environment variables, mainly boolean flags and a directory path. It enforces that if zero_gpu mode is enabled ('SPACES_ZERO_GPU'), the 'SPACES_ZERO_DEVICE_API_URL' must be set, which is a reasonable validation. No external or untrusted data is directly used in insecure operations. No network activity, system modifications, or malicious code are present. Usage of environment variables is typical for configuration and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, this is standard configuration code with no malicious or security-compromising behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration loader that reads environment variables and enforces a validation rule. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and designed for safe configuration management.",
