  "purpose": "Load and configure environment-based settings for ZeroGPU and related components.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as SPACES_ZERO_GPU, SPACES_ZERO_DEVICE_API_URL, SPACES_GRADIO_AUTO_WRAP, ZERO_GPU_PATCH_TORCH_DEVICE, ZEROGPU_V2, ZEROGPU_OFFLOAD_DIR.",
  "sinks": "Environment variable retrieval; assertion that SPACES_ZERO_DEVICE_API_URL is set if zero_gpu is enabled.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read during Settings instantiation; if zero_gpu is true, code asserts that zero_device_api_url is not None.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; straightforward environment variable handling. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a Settings object that reads configuration options from environment variables. It uses a custom boolean conversion for some flags. If zero_gpu is enabled, it asserts that the API URL is provided, which is standard for configuration validation. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No obfuscation or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard configuration loader with validation for required environment variables. No malicious intent or suspicious activity is evident. It is a benign configuration setup for a GPU offloading environment.",
