  "sources": "None; the code contains only a comment string with no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows, untrusted inputs, or outputs that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist, as the code is purely a comment with no executable components.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple comment without obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a comment string 'Unittests' with no executable code, data handling, or logic. All reports correctly identify the absence of any sources, sinks, or data flows. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, reflecting the benign and non-executable nature of the snippet. Confidence levels are high, given the minimal content. No suspicious or malicious behavior is present, and the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder comment with no executable or malicious content. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the content. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
