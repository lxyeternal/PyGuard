{
  "purpose": "The code provides a setup configuration and utility functions for building, testing, and installing the PyObjC framework wrappers in Python projects.",
  "sources": "Uses subprocess to invoke system commands (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), reads environment variables (CFLAGS, PATH, CC), reads files such as SDKSettings.plist and PKG-INFO, and imports modules for testing and build procedures.",
  "sinks": "Subprocess calls executing system commands; file reads including SDK settings, system info, and package metadata; potential modification of sys.path and sys.modules; dynamic imports of test modules.",
  "flows": "System commands (sw_vers, clang, xcrun) feed data into variables; environment variables influence SDK and compiler detection; file reads provide configuration data; subprocess outputs influence SDK and compiler setup; test modules are dynamically imported and executed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of subprocess.check_output to retrieve system information could be exploited if environment variables are manipulated, but it appears standard for environment info. No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected. No obfuscated or intentionally misleading code observed. Code contains standard build utilities, not malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles build and test procedures, invoking system commands to retrieve system info (macOS version, SDK paths, compiler versions). It manipulates sys.path and sys.modules to prepare testing environments, loads configuration files, and dynamically imports test modules. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, remote command execution, or malicious modifications. Usage of subprocess is limited to legitimate system info retrieval. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are present. Overall, the code appears to be standard build configuration code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup and build script for the PyObjC framework. It reads system information, configures build options, and runs tests, all using standard Python modules and system commands. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware indications are evident. The risk of malicious activity is very low.",
