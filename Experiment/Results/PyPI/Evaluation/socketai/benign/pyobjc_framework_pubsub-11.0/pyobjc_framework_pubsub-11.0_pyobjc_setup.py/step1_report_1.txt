{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package build process for the PyObjC framework, including custom build commands, test suite management, and packaging configurations.",
  "sources": "Reading input or data occurs at subprocess calls (e.g., 'sw_vers', 'clang', 'xcrun'), file reads (e.g., SDKSettings.plist, PKG-INFO), environment variables (e.g., 'CFLAGS', 'PATH', 'CC'), and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or effects could occur if subprocess outputs or environment variables are improperly used or if file data is mishandled, but primarily these are used internally for configuration. No untrusted input is directly written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and subprocess outputs (e.g., SDK info, compiler versions) into internal variables, used for configuration and build flags. Files like SDKSettings.plist are read to determine SDK versions. No flow leads to external system compromise.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs extensive system queries and subprocess calls, but these are standard for configuration. No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are evident. No obfuscated code or misleading variable usage detected.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs environment and system configuration tasks, including SDK detection, compiler validation, and build setup. It employs subprocess calls, file I/O, and environment variables but does so in a contextually appropriate manner. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage are observed. The code is well-structured for build automation without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build setup script for the PyObjC package, with no indicators of malicious activity or supply chain attack vectors. It interacts with system tools for configuration purposes, but all actions are consistent with standard build and testing procedures.",
