  "purpose": "This code is a setup and build configuration script for the PyObjC framework, handling environment detection, SDK versioning, build customization, and testing procedures.",
  "sources": "System commands (sw_vers, clang, xcrun), environment variables (CFLAGS, PATH, CC), plist files (SDKSettings.plist, PKG-INFO), package metadata, and test modules.",
  "sinks": "Internal data used for configuration; no external data exfiltration or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "System info gathered via subprocess calls flows into build configuration; environment variables influence compiler flags; test modules are dynamically loaded for testing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected. All subprocess calls and file reads are standard for build scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script performs environment detection, SDK versioning, build customization, and testing setup typical for a macOS-specific Python extension package. No malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The code is well-structured and transparent, with no signs of obfuscation or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured build and test setup script for PyObjC, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. The scores are consistent with its purpose: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, security risk = 0.2.",
