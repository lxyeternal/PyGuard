  "purpose": "Unit test for constants in the PubSub module related to link types",
  "sources": "Importing PubSub module, reading constants from PubSub",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external effects observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded constants are standard for test cases",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module called PubSub and a testing framework. It defines a test case that asserts the values of specific constants within the PubSub module. There is no dynamic code execution, no input handling, no external network communication, and no secret or credential usage. The code appears to be a straightforward unit test verifying static constants. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, benign test case verifying constants within a module. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
