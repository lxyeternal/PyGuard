{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test verifying constant values in the PubSub module related to PSLink types.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the imported PubSub module to access constant attributes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "The code accesses constant attributes in PubSub; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code imports PubSub and performs assertions on specific constants to verify their values. It contains no dynamic behavior, external data input, or network activity. The code is a simple, static unit test with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given its benign nature. The code's purpose is solely to verify constants, and no anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward unit test verifying constants in the PubSub module. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
