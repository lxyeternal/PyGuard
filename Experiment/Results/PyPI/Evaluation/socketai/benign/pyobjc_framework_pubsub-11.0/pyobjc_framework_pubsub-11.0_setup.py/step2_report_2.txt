  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n1. **Code Review:**\n   - The provided code is a setup script for the `pyobjc-framework-PubSub` package.\n   - It appears to be a standard package configuration, wrapping the macOS PubSub framework.\n   - No malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are evident in this setup script.\n   - The code does not include any dynamic code execution, network operations, or other suspicious behavior.\n\n2. **Reports Analysis:**\n   - All reports (1 through 5) contain only the message \"Empty response\" with no additional details.\n   - This indicates that there are no specific findings, errors, or issues documented in these reports.\n   - Without detailed information, it's impossible to identify vulnerabilities, malware, or flaws from these reports.\n\n3. **Scores and Risk Assessment:**\n   - Since the reports lack content, assigning high malware or risk scores would be unjustified.\n   - The absence of any evidence or detailed description suggests that the package is likely benign.\n   - The scores should reflect the lack of detected issues.\n\n4. **Potential Concerns:**\n   - The code is a standard setup script, with no signs of malicious activity.\n   - The \"Empty response\" reports could mean no issues were found or that the reports are incomplete.\n   - Without further context or detailed findings, there is no reason to suspect malicious intent.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, primarily because of the lack of information; if no issues are found, it should be minimal)\n\n**Summary:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, there is no indication of vulnerabilities, malware, or obfuscation. The reports lack details, so the scores should be minimal, reflecting no detected issues.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Await more detailed reports or evidence before considering higher risk scores.\n- Confirm that the reports are complete and not truncated or missing data.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe package appears safe based on the current information. The scores should be adjusted to reflect the absence of issues, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero and a very low risk score.",
