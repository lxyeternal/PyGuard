  "review": "Let's analyze the situation carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The provided code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package wrapping the macOS PubSub framework via PyObjC.\n   - There are no obvious security issues, malicious code, or vulnerabilities in this script.\n   - The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior, nor does it perform any network operations, file manipulations, or other potentially harmful actions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Report's Logic or Summary:**\n   - All reports are marked with \"Empty response\" and contain no details.\n   - Since no actual report content is provided, there are no claims, reasoning, or summaries to evaluate.\n   - This lack of information prevents any meaningful assessment of potential issues or risks.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - Without any report details, assigning risk or malware scores is speculative.\n   - If the scores assigned in the original reports are based solely on the absence of information, they should be considered unreliable.\n   - Given the code's benign nature, the risk and malware scores should be very low or zero unless there's external evidence.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since no malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident, high risk scores are unjustified.\n   - The same applies to malware scores; there's no indication of malicious intent or payload.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - Any claims of vulnerabilities or maliciousness without supporting evidence are unfounded.\n   - Given the lack of report details, it's best to withhold judgment rather than assume risks.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores with the Report:**\n   - Without actual report content, the scores can't be validated.\n   - If scores are high, they should be re-evaluated as unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should be **0** — no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated code score:** Should be **0** — code is straightforward and standard.\n- **Risk score:** Should be **0** — no vulnerabilities or risks are apparent.\n\n### Additional notes:\n- The absence of report details makes it impossible to identify any hidden issues.\n- If future reports contain concrete evidence, reassessment would be necessary.\n\n**Summary:** Based on the provided code and the empty reports, there are no grounds for concern. All scores should be minimal, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
