  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the pyobjc-framework-PubSub package, wrapping the macOS PubSub framework.",
  "sources": "Imports os, sys; modifies sys.path; imports setup from pyobjc_setup.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Imports and modifies sys.path, then calls setup with package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard setup script with no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script, with no malicious code, no network operations, and no suspicious behavior. The sys.path modification is common in setup scripts and not inherently malicious. The reports are empty, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities or malware. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features suggest a benign package. Scores should be zero for malware, obfuscation, and risk, aligning with the absence of issues.",
  "conclusion": "The package appears safe with no detected malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The empty reports do not indicate any issues. The scores should be set to malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, reflecting a benign and secure package.",
