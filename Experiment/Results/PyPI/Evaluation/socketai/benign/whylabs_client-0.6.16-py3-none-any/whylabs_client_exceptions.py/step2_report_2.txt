  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Assessment:** The code is straightforward class definitions for exception handling and a utility function. No external input, data flow, or suspicious behavior.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0. Both are accurate.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0, as there are no security issues or malicious behaviors.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign, standard exception classes.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that no untrusted input is processed dynamically, no code execution, and no data leaks.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0, which is correct.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — perhaps slightly elevated due to the mention of internal data structures, but still negligible.  \n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; exception classes with message formatting, no external data processing.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0, appropriate.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0, aligns with the benign nature.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe exception handling code.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Assessment:** Similar to above; no signs of malicious intent, no external data handling, straightforward utility functions.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 — a slight caution, but still negligible.  \n- **Conclusion:** Benign utility code.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion; exception classes with message formatting, no external data or malicious code.  \n- **Malware & Obfuscated:** 0.  \n- **Risk Score:** 0.1, consistent with previous assessments.  \n- **Conclusion:** Standard, safe code.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports confirm that the code is just exception class definitions and a helper function, with no dynamic code, external data processing, or network activity.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is correct. No malicious behaviors are evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** 0 across all reports, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated at 0.1 in some reports, likely due to the potential for error message exposure, but overall negligible.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — no signs of malicious code.  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and readable.  \n**Risk Score:** 0 — no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent detected.\n\n**Note:** The code appears to be a standard, well-structured exception handling module for an API client library, with no supply chain security threats. The small security risk scores reflect typical concerns about error message exposure but do not indicate actual vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is benign, standard exception handling classes, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The assigned scores are appropriate, and I concur with the overall assessment that this code does not pose a supply chain security risk.",
