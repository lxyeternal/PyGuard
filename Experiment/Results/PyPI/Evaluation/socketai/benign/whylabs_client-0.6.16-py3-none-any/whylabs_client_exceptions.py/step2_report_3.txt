  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the potential for malicious activity, and the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a set of exception classes and a utility function (`render_path`) for an API client.\n- No external input processing, network activity, or code execution is present.\n- Exception messages are constructed from internal data structures (`msg`, `path_to_item`, `http_resp`), which are typical in error handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is evident.\n- The code is standard for API client libraries and appears benign.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review per report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Define exception classes.\n- Findings: No external data sources, no sinks, no anomalies.\n- Analysis: Straightforward class definitions, no malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct. No issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Similar to above.\n- Findings: No external data processing, no malicious behavior.\n- Analysis: Standard exception classes, no suspicious code.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk score (0.1) is acceptable, considering the possibility that exception messages could leak info if misused externally. But within this code, no risk is evident.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep as is.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Similar, structured error handling.\n- Findings: No external input or code execution.\n- Analysis: Standard exception classes, no malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes + utility function.\n- Findings: No external data sources, no malicious behavior.\n- Analysis: Utility function is benign; exception classes are standard.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. The minor securityRisk score reflects potential info leakage if exceptions are misused, but within this code, it's benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Exception classes + error message formatting.\n- Findings: No external input processing, no malicious code.\n- Analysis: Standard pattern, no obfuscation or malicious intent.\n- Scores: malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** consistently 0 across all reports, which is correct; no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** mostly 0 or 0.1; given the code's benign nature, these are reasonable.\n\n**Overall:** The scores align well with the code's content and behavior. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n**Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)  \n**Risk:** 0.1 (minor potential info leakage if exception messages are exposed externally, but within this code, no real risk)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, safe implementation of exception classes for an API client, with no supply chain security concerns.",
