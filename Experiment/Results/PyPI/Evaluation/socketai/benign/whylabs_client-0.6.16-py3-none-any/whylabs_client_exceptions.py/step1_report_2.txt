{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for handling API errors and exceptions, providing structured error messages for an OpenAPI client.",
  "sources": "No user input or external data sources are read; only exception handling and string formatting functions are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are identified. The code does not execute external commands or handle sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present; the code primarily constructs error messages and exception objects.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is standard exception handling and string formatting for an API client.",
  "analysis": "The code provides custom exception classes for an API client, including detailed error message construction with optional path rendering. It includes classes for different HTTP error types and a utility function to format error paths. The code does not process external inputs dynamically or execute any code that could be malicious. It is a typical implementation of structured exception handling with no apparent malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom exceptions for an API client, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is unlikely to contain malware or security vulnerabilities.",
