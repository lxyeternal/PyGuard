  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling errors in an OpenAPI client implementation.",
  "sources": "Exception class initializers and the render_path function, which read input parameters such as error messages, paths, and HTTP response objects.",
  "sinks": "Error message construction and string formatting, potentially exposing internal error details if used improperly in a broader context.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (error messages, paths, HTTP responses) flow into exception constructors, which generate descriptive error messages; render_path processes path lists into strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated patterns observed. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of custom exception classes for API error handling, including mechanisms to format error messages with optional path and HTTP response details. The render_path function converts a list of path segments into a string, aiding in debugging. The design is standard for API clients and does not include any malicious logic or external data handling. The potential security concern would be if error details expose sensitive information, but this depends on how these exceptions are used externally; within this code, no such exposure occurs.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard error handling classes for an OpenAPI client with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It provides structured error reporting, which is common in API client libraries. No malicious or sabotage code is detected.",
