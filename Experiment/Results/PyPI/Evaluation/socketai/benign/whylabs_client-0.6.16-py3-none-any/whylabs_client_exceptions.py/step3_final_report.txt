  "purpose": "Define exception classes and a utility function for rendering error paths in an API client library.",
  "sources": "Internal data structures such as 'msg', 'path_to_item', and 'http_resp' used in exception message construction.",
  "sinks": "Exception messages potentially exposing internal error details; no external data input or network activity.",
  "flows": "Error data (msg, path_to_item, http_resp) flows into exception message formatting functions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward class definitions and utility function.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of exception class definitions and a helper function for rendering paths. It does not process external input, execute code, or perform network operations. Exception messages are constructed from internal variables, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present. The minimal security risk stems from potential error message exposure, but this is typical in error handling code. The malware score is appropriately 0, obfuscation score 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1) due to error message exposure considerations, but no actual vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of exception handling for an API client. It poses no supply chain security risks, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. The scores assigned are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
