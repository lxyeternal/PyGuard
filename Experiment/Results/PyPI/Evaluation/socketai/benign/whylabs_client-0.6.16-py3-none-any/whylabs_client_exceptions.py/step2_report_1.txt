  "review": "Let's analyze each report systematically:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code defines exception classes and a utility function without processing external data or executing code.\n- **Errors, Flaws, Mistakes?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification for risk/malware scores:** None needed; code is benign.\n- **Summary:** The report correctly concludes no security threat.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Similar to Report 1, it’s standard exception class definitions.\n- **Errors, Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1 — perhaps slightly high; no external data handling or network activity.\n- **Justification:** The code only formats messages; no malicious behavior. The small risk score could be justified if considering error message exposure, but overall, it remains low.\n- **Summary:** The report reasonably states no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Standard exception classes with message formatting.\n- **Errors, Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malware or malicious activity.\n- **Summary:** Correctly assesses benign nature.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No.\n- **Errors, Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1 — acceptable.\n- **Justification:** No active malicious behavior; potential for error message exposure is minimal.\n- **Summary:** Accurate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No.\n- **Errors, Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious code; standard exception handling.\n- **Summary:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Generally low (0 or 0.1). Since the code is purely exception handling and utility functions, even the small risk scores are perhaps slightly conservative but acceptable.\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n- The code is standard exception handling for an API client library.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- Slightly increasing the risk score to 0.1 in some reports is reasonable, but 0.0 would also be justified.\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0 to 0.1 (leaning towards 0.0, as no potential vulnerabilities are evident)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate, and the code is benign. No supply chain security issues are present.",
