{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes for handling API-related errors in a Python client, specifically for an OpenAPI-generated client for WhyLabs API. It provides structured error handling and message formatting.",
  "sources": "None of the code reads untrusted input directly. The only potential data input points are the 'path_to_item' arguments used in exception messages, which are internal data structures passed during exception raising.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that execute or process untrusted data directly are present. The code primarily formats and raises exceptions based on internal data, with no network or file system operations.",
  "flows": "Exception messages are constructed from internal variables such as 'msg' and 'path_to_item' and then used in raising exceptions. There are no data flows involving external sources or untrusted inputs leading to potential vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code are present. The code follows standard Python exception handling patterns. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are found.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions for various custom exceptions tailored to API error handling, with utility functions for rendering error paths. The exception classes incorporate message formatting and pass through relevant HTTP response data. All data used in message construction appears to originate from internal or controlled sources. No external input processing, network interactions, or dynamic code execution are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard, well-structured exception handling for an API client. It does not contain malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security vulnerabilities. It primarily enhances error reporting and debugging.",
