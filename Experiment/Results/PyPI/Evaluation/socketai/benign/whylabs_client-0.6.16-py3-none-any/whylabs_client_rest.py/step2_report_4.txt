  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the claims, then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Claim:** The code is a legitimate API client with no malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Evidence:** The code manages network connections, SSL, proxies, and request handling securely. No suspicious patterns or malicious payloads are detected.\n- **Score justifications:** Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.2, confidence is high (0.9). This aligns with the analysis.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion appears reasonable. The code is standard, with no indicators of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Claim:** Similar to Report 1, it describes a standard API client with no malicious intent.\n- **Evidence:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. Proxy and IP validation functions are standard.\n- **Score justifications:** Malware score is 0, security risk is 0.2, confidence is 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No suspicious signals.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Claim:** Again, a typical HTTP client with no malicious features.\n- **Evidence:** Uses standard libraries, handles SSL, proxies, and request methods securely. No signs of malicious payloads.\n- **Score justifications:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Valid and aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Claim:** Standard HTTP client with no malicious intent.\n- **Evidence:** Proper request handling, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, standard network utility functions.\n- **Score justifications:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable conclusion.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Claim:** Same as above—legitimate API client, no malicious activity.\n- **Evidence:** Uses standard practices, no suspicious code, no secrets.\n- **Score justifications:** Malware 0, security risk 0.2, confidence 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports are 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with the code clarity.\n- **Security risk:** Slightly elevated at 0.2, which is reasonable for network code handling untrusted data but not indicating high risk.\n- **Confidence:** High (0.9), given the thorough analysis and absence of suspicious signals.\n\n### Final judgment:\nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and well-founded. The code is a standard, well-implemented HTTP client for API interaction, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to network exposure but no malicious intent)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears secure, legitimate, and free of malicious activity.",
