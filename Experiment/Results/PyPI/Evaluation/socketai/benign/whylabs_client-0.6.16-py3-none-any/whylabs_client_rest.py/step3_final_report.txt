{
  "purpose": "This code implements a Python HTTP client for interacting with the WhyLabs API, handling request setup, SSL, proxies, and response processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters such as URL, headers, query parameters, body, and post parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially untrusted data flows include request bodies, headers, query parameters, and response data; however, these are handled securely without evident data leaks or malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through request construction to network transmission and response handling, with no suspicious data exfiltration or code execution observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, well-structured HTTP client utilizing urllib3, with configurable SSL verification, proxy handling, and request methods. It performs input validation, manages request headers and bodies appropriately, and raises specific exceptions for HTTP errors. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are detected. The functions for IP validation and proxy bypass are typical utilities. The response handling includes standard error mapping. Overall, the code demonstrates secure and correct implementation of an API client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, secure HTTP client with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or sabotage. The low malware score (0), obfuscation score (0), and a modest security risk score (~0.2) are justified based on its functionality. It is safe for use and does not contain malicious signals.",
