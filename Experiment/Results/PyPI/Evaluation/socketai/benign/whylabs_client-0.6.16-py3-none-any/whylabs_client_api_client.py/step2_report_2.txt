  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose:** Describes a generic, auto-generated OpenAPI Python client handling HTTP, serialization, auth, threading.  \n- **Sources/Sinks:** Reads configuration, data, files; sends over network, processes responses.  \n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious structures.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard, auto-generated SDK code. No signs of malicious behavior.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe, no malware or security issues.  \n- **Scores:** malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose:** Implements a standard OpenAPI client for web services.  \n- **Sources/Sinks:** Input data, environment variables, files; network requests, response deserialization.  \n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic.  \n- **Analysis:** Typical SDK pattern, no obfuscation or malicious URL manipulation.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate, no malware.  \n- Scores: malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose:** API client for OpenAPI services, with threading and request handling.  \n- **Sources/Sinks:** User inputs, files, environment configs; network, serialization.  \n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard, auto-generated, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK, no security risks.  \n- Scores: malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2 — justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose:** Generic Python API client for OpenAPI, handles request, serialization, auth.  \n- **Sources/Sinks:** Inputs, headers, files; network requests, response processing.  \n- **Anomalies:** No secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity.  \n- **Analysis:** Typical auto-generated code, no malicious patterns.  \n- **Conclusion:** Safe, standard SDK, no malware.  \n- Scores: malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose:** API client for WhyLabs API, auto-generated, handles request/serialization/auth.  \n- **Sources/Sinks:** Config, headers, files; network requests and responses.  \n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code.  \n- **Analysis:** Standard, secure, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate, safe SDK.  \n- Scores: malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently indicate no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, matching the clear, generated code structure.  \n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero, reflecting the inherent risk in networked SDKs but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors detected.\n\n**Overall Expert Estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malware.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward and generated.  \n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 — minimal, typical for SDKs handling network requests, no active vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\n\nThe code in question is a standard, auto-generated OpenAPI client library with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The low risk scores are justified, and the absence of malware or obfuscation is consistent across all reports.\n\n**Recommended Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (consistent with the reports and analysis)",
