{
  "purpose": "The code is an auto-generated Python client library for the WhyLabs API, handling request construction, serialization, threading, and response processing in a standard manner.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data, input parameters, environment variables, and files; constructs network requests.",
  "sinks": "Sends data over network to API endpoints; processes responses, deserializes data.",
  "flows": "Input data is serialized and sent via HTTP requests; responses are received, decoded, and deserialized back into Python objects.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected. No dynamic code execution or hidden network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical, auto-generated SDK client that manages request serialization, threading, authentication, and response deserialization. It does not contain obfuscated code, malicious logic, or insecure practices. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the low security risk scores (around 0.1-0.2) are justified given its function as a standard API client.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, auto-generated OpenAPI client library with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain compromise. The scores assigned are accurate and consistent with the code's structure and behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
