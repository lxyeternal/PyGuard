  "purpose": "Client SDK for logging debug events to WhyLabs API, enabling integration and telemetry reporting for AI observability.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: org_id, dataset_id, debug_event (from function arguments); External libraries: whylabs_client modules, standard imports (re, sys).",
  "sinks": "API request to '/v0/organizations/{org_id}/debug-events/resources/{dataset_id}/debug-events/log' which transmits debug_event data over network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (sources) are used to construct an API request that transmits debug_event data to the server (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns or suspicious behaviors. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code present. Usage of standard SDK libraries and typical API call structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an auto-generated API client class for logging debug events via a POST request to a specified endpoint. It uses standard library imports, third-party modules, and a well-structured approach for parameter handling, request configuration, and execution. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling detected. External dependencies are typical for SDKs, and no hardcoded secrets or malicious activities are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward, benign SDK client implementation for API interaction. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware are detected. It functions as intended for logging debug events securely through the API.",
