  "purpose": "Auto-generated API client for interacting with WhyLabs diagnostic endpoints to monitor and diagnose AI systems.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (re, sys, whylabs_client), class constructors, endpoint configurations, and method parameters.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request construction and execution via the '_Endpoint' class calls; data returned from API responses.",
  "flows": "Method inputs (org_id, request objects) are passed into '_Endpoint.call_with_http_info' which makes HTTP requests to external API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Usage of standard openapi-generator patterns and dependencies. No obfuscated code, no unusual logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical auto-generated API client class, using standard patterns for REST API interactions. It imports necessary modules, defines API endpoints with configurations, and provides methods to invoke API calls synchronously or asynchronously. The data flows from method parameters through the endpoint calls, with no apparent processing of untrusted data beyond standard request construction. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden network activity. The code adheres to common SDK design patterns and does not contain any anomalies that suggest malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard auto-generated API client library with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It performs routine API interactions for monitoring and diagnosing AI systems and does not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
