{
  "purpose": "This code is an auto-generated Python API client for WhyLabs diagnostics endpoints, facilitating communication with the service via HTTP requests. It does not read or write external data directly, nor does it execute untrusted code.",
  "sources": "Function parameters used in API request methods, which are passed into HTTP request payloads; no external data sources or user inputs are read directly within the code.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request bodies and headers where data is sent over the network; no data leaks, system modifications, or malicious sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from method arguments into HTTP request payloads and headers, then over the network to the API endpoints; no untrusted data is processed in a malicious manner.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of unused imports (`re`, `sys`) likely due to code generation artifacts; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated SDK client for the WhyLabs API, with clearly defined request methods, no embedded secrets, no obfuscated logic, and no malicious patterns. It uses typical API request structures, with no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system interactions. The unused imports are benign artifacts of code generation. All parameters are used appropriately, and the code's behavior aligns with its purpose as a communication layer with the API.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, generated API client with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It functions as intended for API interactions without malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
