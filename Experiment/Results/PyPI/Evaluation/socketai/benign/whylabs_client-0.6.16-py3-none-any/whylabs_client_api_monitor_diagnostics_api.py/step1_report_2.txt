{
  "purpose": "Auto-generated client library for interacting with WhyLabs API diagnostics endpoints, facilitating AI observability diagnostics.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (re, sys), and from whylabs_client modules. No external input sources or user data read operations are present within this code.",
  "sinks": "No code constructs indicate any data leakage or dangerous system effects. No system calls, network transmissions, or data exfiltration actions are visible.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from input sources to potentially dangerous sinks. The code constructs API request configurations and executes them without processing or manipulating external data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is auto-generated, follows a structured API client pattern, and contains no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated logic, or unusual code constructs. No backdoors, malicious injections, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly defines a client class for API interaction, with methods wrapping HTTP requests to specific endpoints. It uses safe parameter handling, with no dynamic code execution, no evaluation of untrusted input, and no data leaks or system manipulations. All imports are standard or from known SDK modules, and no suspicious patterns are found.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward, auto-generated API client library with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to serve its intended purpose of facilitating API calls securely and correctly.",
