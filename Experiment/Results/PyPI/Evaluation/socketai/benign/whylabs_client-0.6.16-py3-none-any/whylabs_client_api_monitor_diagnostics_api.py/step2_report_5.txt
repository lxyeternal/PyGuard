  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a client interface for WhyLabs API, with no external data sources or user inputs read within the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into API requests, no data leaks or system modifications observed.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code is generated, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic. Unused imports (re, sys) are benign, likely artifacts of code generation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that the code is safe and not malicious aligns with the detailed review. The confidence level of 0.9 is appropriate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate and well-justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, no external or user data reading.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data leakage or dangerous system calls.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns. The code is standard SDK code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is safe, with high confidence (0.9).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same observations; no external data read.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard API request flow, no leaks.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious indicators, no obfuscation, no backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The code is a typical generated client, safe, with high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a client for diagnostics endpoints.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows into HTTP requests; no leaks or malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid, safe, and standard.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Sound and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurate, no external data reading.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard API request flow.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correct, with high confidence.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1 are appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-founded.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the analysis. The code is a standard generated API client with no malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, correctly noting no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in most reports, justified as a minimal security risk due to the code's nature as an API client—no active vulnerabilities or malicious code detected.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is straightforward, generated, and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk:** 0.1 — low, primarily due to the fact that it interfaces with external services; no active vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent, justified, and accurate. The scores reflect the actual risk level, and there are no signs of malware or obfuscation. The code appears safe, standard, and appropriate for its purpose.",
