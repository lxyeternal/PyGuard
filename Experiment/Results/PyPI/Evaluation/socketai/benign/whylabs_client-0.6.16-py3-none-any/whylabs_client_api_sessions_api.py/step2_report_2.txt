  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** The report states the code is an auto-generated API client with no malicious or obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious network activity. It notes the absence of dynamic code execution, backdoors, or malware.\n- **Code Confirmation:** The code is a standard API client wrapper, primarily managing request parameters and calling external endpoints. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or obfuscation are evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low, as expected for such code). The confidence is high (0.9).\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. The code appears safe and standard.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is boilerplate generated SDK code with no malicious logic, secrets, or obfuscation. The unused imports (re, sys) are typical in generated code.\n- **Code Confirmation:** No signs of malicious activity; only API request wrappers.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. No malicious intent detected.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Reiterates that the code is an SDK for API interaction, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- **Code Confirmation:** No suspicious code patterns, no dynamic execution, no secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, high confidence (0.95).\n- **Conclusion:** Valid. The code is a standard SDK.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, confirming no malicious or suspicious code, just API request wrappers.\n- **Code Confirmation:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious data handling.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, high confidence (0.9).\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Again, confirms the code is a generated client SDK, with no malicious or obfuscated code, just request forwarding.\n- **Code Confirmation:** No malicious patterns or backdoors.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1, high confidence (0.95).\n- **Conclusion:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Synthesis:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports and the code itself show no signs of malicious code or behavior. The malware score should remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The code is straightforward, generated SDK code with no obfuscation. The obfuscated score should be **0**.\n- **Risk Score:** The overall security risk is minimal; the code only performs API request handling with no secrets or malicious logic. A score of **0.1** seems appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code is a standard, auto-generated Python SDK client for interacting with the WhyLabs API.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity are present.\n- The request flows are typical for SDKs, with no dynamic code execution, secrets, or backdoors.\n- The high confidence scores are justified given the analysis.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the consistent findings across all reports.",
