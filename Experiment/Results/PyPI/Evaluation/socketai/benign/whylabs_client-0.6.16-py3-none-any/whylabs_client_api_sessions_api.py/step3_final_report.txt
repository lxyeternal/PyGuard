  "purpose": "Auto-generated Python SDK client for interacting with WhyLabs API, managing sessions, uploads, and links.",
  "sources": "Request parameter handling, endpoint URL construction, and API call delegation.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request execution to external API endpoints; no untrusted data processing within the code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into request construction, which then triggers network calls to specific API endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Unused imports (`re`, `sys`) are present but typical of generated code; no malicious or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard, auto-generated API client wrapper with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or backdoors. It performs typical parameter validation and delegates network requests to endpoints. No dynamic code execution, secrets, or malicious logic are present. The network interactions are limited to legitimate API calls. The code structure and content are consistent with benign SDKs, and the high confidence scores across multiple assessments support this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe, auto-generated SDK for WhyLabs API interaction. It contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the security risk is minimal. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
