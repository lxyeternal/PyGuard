  "purpose": "Client SDK for interacting with WhyLabs API, enabling session management, uploads, and profile observatory link retrieval.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as session_id, org_id, create_session_request, log_async_request, log_reference_request, get_profile_observatory_link_request, which are passed to API calls.",
  "sinks": "API call execution via call_with_http_info, which sends data over network; no direct code injection, data leakage, or insecure operations detected.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into API endpoint calls, which perform HTTP requests to server URLs; no malicious flows or obfuscation observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious variable names. The code strictly manages API request parameters and calls.",
  "analysis": "The code is an auto-generated API client wrapper for Python, providing methods to interact with specific API endpoints. It performs parameter validation, constructs HTTP requests, and manages async options. There are no signs of malicious logic, such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or backdoors. The code adheres to standard API client structure without any suspicious behavior. Usage of external libraries appears legitimate, and no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard auto-generated API client for interfacing with WhyLabs API. It contains no malicious or maliciously obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious network activity beyond normal API requests. It is safe from supply chain attacks or malicious sabotage.",
