  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the provided code.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is an auto-generated Python client SDK for the WhyLabs API.\n- It primarily wraps HTTP requests to specific endpoints, passing parameters and handling async options.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code are present.\n- No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or backdoors.\n- Imports like `re` and `sys` are unused, indicating boilerplate rather than malicious intent.\n- The code's logic is straightforward: construct API requests and send them over the network.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n\n- No malicious or suspicious code patterns are present.\n- The code is standard SDK boilerplate generated by OpenAPI tools.\n- No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are detected.\n- No hardcoded secrets or credentials are embedded.\n- The network interactions are typical API calls.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a legitimate auto-generated API client with no malicious issues.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the individual reports:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** No malicious or obfuscated code, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct. The analysis is accurate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, no malicious behavior, boilerplate code, malware score 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Same conclusion, no malicious code, standard SDK, malware score 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others, no malicious activity, standard API client, malware score 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same findings, no malicious code, safe, malware score 0.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (0.1), as the code is a standard SDK with no evident security issues.\n\n**Any adjustments?**  \nNo. The scores are reasonable and justified based on the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The code is a typical auto-generated SDK for API interaction.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or high-risk elements are present.\n- The scores across all reports are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### My own assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Security risk:** 0.1 (minimal, due to network interactions but no malicious intent)\n\n**Overall, the code is safe and well-structured for its purpose.**",
