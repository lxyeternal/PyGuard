  "purpose": "Client SDK for interacting with WhyLabs API for session management, profile uploads, and observatory links.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function parameters such as session_id, org_id, create_session_request, and various request objects; makes HTTP requests via internally defined endpoints.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request calls that transmit data (session IDs, request payloads) to external API endpoints.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters (sources) to the call_with_http_info method, which sends data to external APIs (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code; no unusual code constructs. The code is a standard API client implementation with no suspicious behavior or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a client class for interacting with an API, utilizing dynamically generated endpoint objects for various operations such as creating sessions, uploading profiles, claiming sessions, and retrieving links. It accepts input parameters, performs no data processing or storage beyond parameter passing, and makes HTTP requests to external servers. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present. The code structure and import statements indicate a typical generated API client. No signs of malware or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, automatically generated API client without any malicious intent or security issues. It simply forwards data to external API endpoints as intended. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
