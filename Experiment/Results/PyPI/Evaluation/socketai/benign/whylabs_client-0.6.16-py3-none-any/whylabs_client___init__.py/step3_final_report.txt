  "purpose": "This code is a minimal, auto-generated SDK setup script for the WhyLabs API client, consisting of comments, version info, and import statements. It serves to initialize the client library environment.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'whylabs_client' modules, version declaration, and comments indicating purpose and contact info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network calls, or data processing present; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The code only imports modules and sets version info; there are no data flows, input handling, or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward, static, and auto-generated SDK boilerplate with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup script with no dynamic execution, data handling, or network activity. It contains only comments, version info, and import statements, with no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation. The absence of any malicious or risky behavior indicates a benign nature. The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's content and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, auto-generated SDK setup module with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of zero across malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
