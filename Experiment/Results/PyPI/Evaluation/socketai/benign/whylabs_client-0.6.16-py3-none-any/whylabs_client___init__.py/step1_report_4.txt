  "purpose": "This code initializes a Python client library for the WhyLabs API, importing necessary modules and exceptions for API interaction.",
  "sources": "Imports from whylabs_client library modules and exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; code only imports modules and sets version.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; code simply imports and defines a version.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules and exceptions from the whylabs_client library, sets a version string, and contains no user input, network operations, or other data handling. It appears to be a straightforward API client setup. No obfuscated code, no hidden behavior, and no malicious indicators are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API client initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
