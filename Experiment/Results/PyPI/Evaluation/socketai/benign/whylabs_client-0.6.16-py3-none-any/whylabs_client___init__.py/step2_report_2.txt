  "review": "Let's carefully evaluate each report and the associated code fragment.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a minimal, auto-generated SDK setup script.\n- It contains comments, version info, and import statements for the `whylabs_client` package.\n- No dynamic code, data processing, network activity, or sensitive data is present.\n- No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are visible.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Malicious Behavior or Malware**\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is boilerplate for an API client library. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malware. The code does not perform any network calls, execute untrusted code, or handle untrusted data.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Malware score: 0** — no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Obfuscation**\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is straightforward, with clear comments and standard import statements. No obfuscation techniques are used.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Obfuscated score: 0** — code is clear and unobfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Security Risks and Reasonableness of Scores**\n\nAll reports assign a security risk score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. The code is static, does not handle untrusted data, and is typical SDK boilerplate.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**Risk score: 0** — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Evaluation of the Reports' Reasoning and Logic**\n\n- The reports correctly identify the code as auto-generated SDK setup code.\n- They note the absence of dynamic or malicious behaviors.\n- No report overstates the risk or makes unwarranted assumptions.\n\n**No corrections needed here.**\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Overall Consistency and Final Estimation**\n\nBased on the provided code and reports:\n\n| Metric             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Malware            | 0      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      |\n| Security Risk      | 0      |\n\n**Final Justification:**  \nThe code is purely boilerplate, with no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports are consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis code fragment is safe, standard SDK setup code, with no security concerns.",
