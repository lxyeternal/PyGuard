  "purpose": "This code provides metadata and imports for the WhyLabs API client, enabling interaction with the WhyLabs AI observability platform.",
  "sources": "No external input sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are established within this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of comments, version info, and import statements; no unusual or suspicious operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be boilerplate for a client library, including metadata and import statements. It imports classes related to API client functionality and exception handling from a package called 'whylabs_client'. There are no dynamic code execution, data processing, or network operations in this fragment. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible. The comments reference API version and contact info, typical for SDK or client library code.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this code snippet. It appears to be a straightforward, non-malicious setup code for an API client library.",
