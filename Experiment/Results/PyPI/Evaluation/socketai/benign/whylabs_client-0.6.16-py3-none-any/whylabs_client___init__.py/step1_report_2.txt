{
  "purpose": "To serve as a client library for interacting with the WhyLabs API, facilitating end-to-end AI observability.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and exceptions from the 'whylabs_client' package.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or external connections.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports modules and exceptions; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a generated code comment and import statements; no malicious or unusual code behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The script consists of a comment header, version declaration, and import statements for modules and exceptions from a client library. It appears to be auto-generated API client code for the WhyLabs platform. There are no dynamic inputs, no network connections, no evaluation or execution of code with untrusted data, and no signs of malicious activity or backdoors. The structure and content are typical of generated SDKs for API interaction. No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious behavior, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, non-malicious generated API client stub used for integrating with WhyLabs. It does not contain malware, suspicious behavior, or security risks.",
