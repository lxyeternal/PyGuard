  "purpose": "To serve as an API client for WhyLabs, enabling interaction with their API for AI observability.",
  "sources": "Imports from whylabs_client modules, including api_client, configuration, and exception classes.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no use of untrusted data inputs or outputs observed in this fragment.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code consists solely of comments, metadata, and straightforward imports.",
  "analysis": "The code contains no executable logic beyond importing modules and defining version info. It includes a header comment describing the purpose, versioning, and contact info. No hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident. All imports appear to be standard for a client library. The presence of a generated API client is typical and does not imply malicious intent. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup for a client SDK, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears safe and legitimate.",
