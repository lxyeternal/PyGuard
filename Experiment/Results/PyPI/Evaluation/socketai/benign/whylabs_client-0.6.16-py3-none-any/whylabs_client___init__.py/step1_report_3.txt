{
  "purpose": "This code is a generated API client for WhyLabs, providing access to the WhyLabs API for AI observability.",
  "sources": "It imports modules from the 'whylabs_client' package, which are likely external dependencies, and defines a version string.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or execution effects.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports modules and defines a version; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The only unusual aspect is the presence of a generated code header and multiple explicit imports, which is typical for SDKs, not suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, consisting of import statements for the client library components and a version declaration. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or use of environment variables. Since it's auto-generated SDK code, its purpose is to provide API access. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The initial comment suggests it is for API interaction, not executing any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard auto-generated SDK setup code for the WhyLabs API. It does not contain any malicious or suspicious elements. It is safe based on the provided fragment.",
