  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and assess their findings, reasoning, and scores.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is boilerplate, auto-generated SDK setup code.\n- No suspicious behaviors, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious indicators are present.\n- The code only performs imports, version declaration, and comments.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, aligning with the absence of malicious activity.\n- The security risk score is 0, which seems appropriate given the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly conclude that there are no malicious or security issues in this code snippet.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning?**  \n  No. The reasoning is sound; the code is straightforward and typical for an SDK setup.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes. Malware is 0, and security risk is 0, consistent with the code's content.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- The code is purely static, with no dynamic behavior, network calls, or data processing.\n- No obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious imports.\n- The presence of generated code comments and standard import statements is typical for SDKs.\n\n### Justification for scores:\n- **Malware (0):** No malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk (0):** No security risks identified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\nBased on the provided code and reports, **the overall scores should be:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is benign, standard SDK boilerplate, and contains no security issues.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe reports are accurate and appropriately scored. The code is safe, non-malicious, and typical for an auto-generated API client setup. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores at malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.",
