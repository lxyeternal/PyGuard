  "purpose": "Client library for interacting with WhyLabs API to retrieve monitor configuration schemas.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (re, sys, whylabs_client), class instantiation, and method parameters (org_id).",
  "sinks": "HTTP request construction and execution via _Endpoint.call_with_http_info, sending org_id as a path parameter.",
  "flows": "Input org_id flows through get_monitor_config_schema method to the call_with_http_info which constructs and executes an API request.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. Use of standard API client patterns. No obfuscated code present. No external data exfiltration or malicious side-effects detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is an auto-generated API client class that encapsulates making HTTP GET requests to retrieve monitor schema information. It uses standard methods for setting request parameters, options, and calling an endpoint object. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or data leaks are present. The imports are common, with no sensitive or malicious functions. The only data read is the 'org_id' parameter, which is used to construct an API call. The code does not perform any malicious activities such as network tunneling, data exfiltration, or backdoor access. It strictly adheres to API request logic with standard security measures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, auto-generated API client library for interfacing with WhyLabs API. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security threats are evident. It appears safe and aligns with normal SDK patterns.",
