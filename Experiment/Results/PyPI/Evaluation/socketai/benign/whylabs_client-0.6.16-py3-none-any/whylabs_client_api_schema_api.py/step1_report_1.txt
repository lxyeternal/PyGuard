{
  "purpose": "The code implements an auto-generated API client class for interacting with the WhyLabs API, specifically to retrieve monitor configuration schemas.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from function arguments, mainly the 'org_id' parameter passed to 'get_monitor_config_schema'. No external input sources are explicitly read within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "The code uses the 'org_id' parameter in constructing an HTTP request via 'call_with_http_info'. No other untrusted data sinks or sensitive data leakage points are evident.",
  "flows": "The 'org_id' input flows into the 'call_with_http_info' method, which prepares and executes an HTTP GET request to a specified API endpoint.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual logic are present. The code appears to be standard generated API client code with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an API client class 'SchemaApi' with an initialization method and a method 'get_monitor_config_schema' that constructs an HTTP request. All parameters are standard, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or malicious data handling. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code flow are observed. The code relies on external library 'whylabs_client', and uses standard practices for API requests.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, auto-generated API client implementation with no indications of malicious intent or security issues. It primarily serves to make authorized API calls using provided parameters, with no suspicious or harmful behavior detected.",
