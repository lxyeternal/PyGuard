  "purpose": "Unit tests for reading and writing Excel (.xls) and CSV files using standard libraries, verifying data integrity and cleanup.",
  "sources": "Local file creation, data writing, and reading functions; no external data sources or network activity.",
  "sinks": "Reading data back from files; no untrusted data or external communication involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from test data structures into file write functions, then read back into memory for verification.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward local file operations for testing purposes, with no external data, network activity, or malicious code. It uses standard libraries and performs cleanup after tests. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The data flow is limited to local file I/O, and no external inputs or outputs are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed solely for testing spreadsheet read/write functionality. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities.",
