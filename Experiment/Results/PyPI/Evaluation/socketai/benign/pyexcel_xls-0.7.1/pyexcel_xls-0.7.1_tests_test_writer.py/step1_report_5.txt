  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of test cases for writing and reading Excel (.xls) files using specific writer classes and modules.",
  "sources": "Reading data from files using get_data and checking for file existence with os.path.exists.",
  "sinks": "Writing files to disk with writer.write() and os.unlink(), no direct untrusted input handling or network operations present.",
  "flows": "File creation and writing through writer.write() → reading back data with get_data() → cleanup with os.unlink()",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic present. The code structure and imports are typical for testing.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for reading and writing Excel files, defines classes with test methods to write sample data to .xls files, verify the written content, and clean up test files. The logic is straightforward, focusing on file I/O operations, with no indication of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. There are no data leaks, external network interactions, or obfuscated code. The only notable aspect is the use of file operations, which are standard in testing contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard test cases for Excel file read/write functionality with no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs basic file operations and data verification in a controlled testing environment.",
