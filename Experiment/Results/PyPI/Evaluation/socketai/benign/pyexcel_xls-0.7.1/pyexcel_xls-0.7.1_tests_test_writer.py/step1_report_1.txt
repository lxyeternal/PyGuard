  "purpose": "The code is a set of test classes for writing and reading Excel files using various libraries, primarily to verify correct functionality of file writing and data retrieval.",
  "sources": "Reading file system for existing test files; no external data sources or user inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent over network, written to untrusted locations, or exposed outside the system.",
  "flows": "Test methods create files, write data, then verify data integrity; no external or untrusted data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors observed. File handling is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines test classes that create, write, read, and delete Excel files for validation purposes. It uses well-known libraries such as 'pyexcel_xls' and 'pyexcel_xls.xlsw'. The file operations are limited to local file creation and deletion. There are no network operations, no dynamic code execution, nor any handling of untrusted input. The code structure is typical for unit tests, with setup and teardown methods for file management. No anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of test classes for verifying Excel file read/write functionality. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It performs file operations within the local filesystem only, with no indication of supply chain attacks.",
