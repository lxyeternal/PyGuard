  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, consistency of scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as an Excel reader using xlrd, handling sheets, merged cells, hidden rows/columns, and date conversions. The sources (file streams, contents, filenames) match the code.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transmission; data flows are local, from input to in-memory structures.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, backdoors, obfuscation, or malicious code. The code is straightforward, standard for a spreadsheet parser.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that there's no malware or malicious activity is accurate. Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2. These seem reasonable given the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is accurate, and scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, consistent with the code's functionality.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication or command execution. The data flow is from input files to internal structures.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no network activity, no backdoors. The code's purpose aligns with standard spreadsheet reading.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is benign. Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. These are reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Consistent with the code's features.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data transmission or malicious sinks. Data flows are local.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code performs standard operations.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the code as benign. Confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0-0.1. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code's function.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external communication, no code injection, just data parsing.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors detected. The code is standard for reading Excel files.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly concludes the code is benign. Confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1. Reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately reflects the code's features.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows are local, from files into internal structures, no external transmission.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or backdoors. The code is a typical Excel reader.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly states the code is benign. Confidence is high (1).\n\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.0-0.1. Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All 0, consistent with the code's clarity.\n\n- **Security risk scores:** Slightly above zero, reflecting typical concerns with untrusted input data, but nothing indicating actual vulnerabilities.\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious behavior detected or implied.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n\n- **Risk score:** **0.1** — minimal, standard risk for processing untrusted files, but no active vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, accurate, and appropriately scored. The code appears safe, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.",
