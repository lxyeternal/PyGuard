  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their assessments with the code, and then synthesize an overall evaluation.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a plugin registration and wrapper module for handling Excel files (.xls, .xlsx, .xlsm).\n- It performs a version check on `xlrd` to determine supported formats.\n- It registers plugin classes for reading/writing via `pyexcel_io`.\n- It provides `get_data` and `save_data` functions that delegate to external `read_data` and `write_data`.\n- No hardcoded secrets, network calls, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present.\n- The code relies on external libraries and standard practices.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Accurate; describes the module as a file handler for Excel formats.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states no malicious code, no obfuscation, and standard practices.\n- **Risk & malware scores:** Both 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high)\n- **Verdict:** The report is accurate; no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1; handling XLS/XLSM with xlrd/xlwt.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; standard plugin registration.\n- **Risk & malware scores:** Both 0, reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Verdict:** No issues; consistent with the code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Same general purpose.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; standard plugin setup.\n- **Scores:** Both 0, reasonable.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Same purpose.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; standard data handling.\n- **Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.95\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Same general description.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious code; plugin registration and data flow are standard.\n- **Scores:** Both 0.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of malware:** None detected; all reports agree.\n- **Obfuscation:** None; all reports agree.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The code handles untrusted streams but delegates to external functions (`read_data`, `write_data`) which are assumed safe. No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All are 0 for malware and security risk, which is appropriate.\n- **Logic & reasoning:** Correct and consistent across reports.\n\n### Final Justification:\n\n- The code is a standard plugin registration and wrapper module for handling Excel files.\n- No malicious, obfuscated, or vulnerable patterns are present.\n- The external functions are assumed to be safe and are common in such libraries.\n- The version check and plugin registration are routine.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimated Scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is safe, legitimate, and free from malicious or obfuscated content. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
