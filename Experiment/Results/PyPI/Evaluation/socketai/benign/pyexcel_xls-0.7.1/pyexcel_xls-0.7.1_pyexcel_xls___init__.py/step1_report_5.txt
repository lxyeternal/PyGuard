{
  "purpose": "This module provides functions and plugin configurations for reading and writing XLS, XLSX, and XLSM spreadsheet files using the xlrd and xlwt libraries.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from file streams, memory, or content sources via the read_data and isstream functions imported from pyexcel_io.io.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to file or memory streams via the write_data function from pyexcel_io.io.",
  "flows": "Input streams or files are passed to read_data or write_data, with file_type determined based on stream detection or provided parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic code execution is present. The code mainly handles plugin registration and simple data flow.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and functions, determines xlrd version, configures supported file formats, registers plugin classes for reading and writing files, and provides simple wrapper functions for data IO. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code are detected. The code operates solely as a plugin configuration and data handling layer, with no apparent malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard plugin setup for handling spreadsheet files with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It performs file format checks, plugin registration, and simple data IO operations without any suspicious activities.",
