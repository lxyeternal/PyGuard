  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and evaluate the scores and claims.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Correctly describes the code as a plugin registration and format handler. The data flow is from input streams/files to external 'read_data'/'write_data'.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious behaviors, no obfuscation, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets. The code is straightforward, managing plugin registration based on xlrd version.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The conclusion that there's no malicious activity is accurate. Confidence is high (1).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 (correct)  \n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- securityRisk: 0 (correct)\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report's reasoning and scoring are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1, describing input streams and external functions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious code, no obfuscation, standard library usage, plugin registration. The external functions are assumed safe.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes no malicious intent. Slightly lower confidence (0.9) but justified.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0 (correct)  \n- obfuscated: 0 (correct)  \n- securityRisk: 0.2 (minimal, since the code handles untrusted input streams but no evident risk)\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring aligns with the analysis. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing plugin registration and data handling.\n- No suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n- Correctly identifies the code as standard plugin registration.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0.2 (consistent with handling untrusted input streams)\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Focuses on input/output handling, plugin registration, and safe delegation to external functions.\n- No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious activity.\n- Correctly states the code is standard and safe.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Similar overview, emphasizing plugin setup, safe data handling, no obfuscation or malicious activity.\n- The analysis aligns with the code's behavior.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- malware: 0  \n- obfuscated: 0  \n- securityRisk: 0\n\n**Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with clear, straightforward code.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in some reports due to handling untrusted streams, which is a minor concern but not malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal risk due to untrusted input handling, but standard practice)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to handling untrusted streams, but this is common and not inherently risky)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears secure, legitimate, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The minor risk score reflects cautious handling of untrusted input streams but does not indicate any serious security concern.",
