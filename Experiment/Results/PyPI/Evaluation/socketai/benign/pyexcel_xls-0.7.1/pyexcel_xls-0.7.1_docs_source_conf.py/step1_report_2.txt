  "sources": "Constant string definitions, Sphinx extension list, configuration variables, and path settings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input or data sinks are present; static configuration data only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration values only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. The code contains typical configuration patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily static configuration for Sphinx documentation, including project info, extensions, themes, and path settings. No user input, external data, or dynamic execution is present. The code does not perform any network operations, file manipulation beyond configuration paths, or contain any suspicious constructs. It appears to be standard documentation setup code with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward configuration file for documentation purposes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
