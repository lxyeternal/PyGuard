{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for creating, reading, and verifying spreadsheet files using the pyexcel library, primarily for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as function arguments, internal static data structures used for file content.",
  "sinks": "File system operations such as saving and reading files via pyexcel, with cleanup using os.unlink.",
  "flows": "Data flows from internal data structures to files during save operations, and from files back into pyexcel sheet objects during read operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets detected. No external untrusted input processing or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing standard file creation, reading, and verification for testing purposes. It uses static data and controlled file paths, with cleanup procedures. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The use of standard library functions and pyexcel APIs indicates benign intent. The overall structure and data flow are typical for testing utilities, with no signs of malicious payloads or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for testing and utility functions with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
