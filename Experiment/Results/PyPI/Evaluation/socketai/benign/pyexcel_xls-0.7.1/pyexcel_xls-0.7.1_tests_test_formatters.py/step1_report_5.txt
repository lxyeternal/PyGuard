{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test reading and writing date formats and detecting integer types in Excel files using the pyexcel library.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from Excel files created during tests, specifically from fixtures and temporary files.",
  "sinks": "Uses pyexcel functions to read and write files; no untrusted data sinks such as network connections, system commands, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads (get_sheet, get_book) to assertions checking data types and values; no external or untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are observed. The code primarily performs test assertions on date and integer detection.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard and third-party libraries for Excel processing and testing. It creates, reads, and deletes files for testing purposes. The functions are used solely for verifying data types and formats. No network activity, code injection, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs legitimate testing functions without obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard test suite for verifying Excel file date and integer detection functionalities. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The script is safe for use and does not pose a supply chain threat.",
