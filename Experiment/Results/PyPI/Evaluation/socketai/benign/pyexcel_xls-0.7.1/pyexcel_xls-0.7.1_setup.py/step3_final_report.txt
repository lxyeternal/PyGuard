  "purpose": "Standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library with optional release automation features.",
  "sources": "File reading functions, os.system calls for build, upload, and release commands, optional import of 'gease'.",
  "sinks": "os.system calls executing static commands; no untrusted data flow detected.",
  "flows": "Source: static command strings in os.system; Sink: execution of system commands for build, upload, and release.",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system with static commands; optional 'gease' import for release automation; no code obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py with functions for reading files, filtering test code, and custom commands for publishing. It uses os.system to execute predefined commands, which is standard but could be risky if inputs were manipulated; here, commands are static. The optional 'gease' import is for GitHub release automation and is not malicious. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or secrets are present. The code's structure and behavior align with common packaging practices, and no malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a safe, standard packaging utility with minimal security concerns. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2 due to system command execution, which is acceptable in this controlled context.",
