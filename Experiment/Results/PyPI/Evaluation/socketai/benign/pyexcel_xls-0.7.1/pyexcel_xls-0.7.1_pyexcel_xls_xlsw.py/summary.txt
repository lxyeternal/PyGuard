  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, transparent implementation of an XLS writer using well-known libraries, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-compromising elements. The security risk is negligible, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly assigned as 0. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in some reports can be lowered to 0 for consistency, but even as is, it reflects the minimal potential for issues."
