  "purpose": "Implement lazy loading of the 'some_func' attribute to optimize import performance.",
  "sources": "Importing 'lazy_loader' library and calling 'lazy.attach' to dynamically attach attributes to the module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network operations, or file I/O present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "The module imports 'lazy_loader', then attaches 'some_func' via 'lazy.attach', with no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; straightforward use of a lazy loader pattern without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a standard lazy loading pattern to defer loading 'some_func', which is common for performance optimization. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is evident. The scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with a benign pattern. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security risks. The pattern is widely used and does not inherently pose security concerns. The low risk score reflects minimal concern, acknowledging that lazy loading can sometimes obscure malicious behavior if misused, but no such evidence exists here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of lazy loading with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores are appropriate and justified. The pattern is standard and safe, and no adjustments are necessary.",
