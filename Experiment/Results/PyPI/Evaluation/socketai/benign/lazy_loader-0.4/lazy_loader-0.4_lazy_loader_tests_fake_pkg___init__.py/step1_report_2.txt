{
  "purpose": "Dynamically attaches lazy-loaded submodules or attributes to the current module using a third-party library.",
  "sources": "The import statement importing 'lazy_loader' as 'lazy'. The 'lazy.attach' function call which defines module attributes.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Import lazy_loader -> attach submodule attributes to the current module.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal anomalies; the code uses lazy loading, which is common for performance optimization. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party lazy loading library and uses it to attach attributes to the current module. The submodule attributes are explicitly specified, and no untrusted input is processed. There are no suspicious or malicious constructs, no network activity, or file system manipulation. The code appears to be a standard pattern for improving module load times with lazy loading, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward implementation of lazy loading modules without any malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscation and poses no security threat.",
