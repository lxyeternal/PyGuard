  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script for data processing or utility purposes, but no explicit purpose is clearly stated due to lack of comments or documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables and possibly from user input or file I/O (if present in omitted parts).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to network connections, files, or environment variables; uses standard output or logging.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input sources through processing functions to sinks such as network, files, or logs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual dynamic code execution observed. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and does not contain obvious malicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, is standard. No unusual data flows or code injection patterns are evident. The absence of comments or documentation limits understanding, but no signs of malware or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security threats.",
