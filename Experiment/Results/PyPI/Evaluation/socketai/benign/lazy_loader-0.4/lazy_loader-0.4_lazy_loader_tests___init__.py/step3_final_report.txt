  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing, utility functions, or environment variable handling, with no explicit malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, input functions, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to network, files, or logs; no specific sinks identified as malicious.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment variables/input) to sinks (network, files, logs) through standard operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or malicious behavior. The absence of code snippets limits certainty, but the description suggests benign operations. No obfuscation or malicious code detected. Confidence is high due to consistent benign assessments across reports. The malware score is set to 0, and the security risk score is low (0.2), reflecting minimal perceived threat given the incomplete context.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code shows no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware score remains at 0. The assessments are consistent and conservative, suitable given the limited data.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
