  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be for general data processing or utility functions, based on the absence of specific application logic or comments.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly shown; the code does not read from files, network, or environment variables directly.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections or file writes if present, but none are explicitly identified in the code. No untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks detected; the code mainly performs standard operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are observed. The code structure appears normal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks explicit data input sources or sinks; it uses standard Python constructs without suspicious patterns. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or obfuscated segments. The absence of external data handling or suspicious imports suggests it is a benign utility or application snippet. There are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign, with no indications of malware, malicious data leaks, or backdoors. The confidence level is high that this code is safe.",
