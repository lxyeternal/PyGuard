  "purpose": "Placeholder function named 'some_func' with no operational code or explicit purpose.",
  "sources": "No data input, external data, or environment reads present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs, network operations, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow or control flow paths; function does nothing and has no side effects.",
  "anomalies": "Function name matches a submodule name, which could be confusing but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single function definition with no implementation. There are no data sources, no sinks, and no flows. The function is a placeholder with no logic, no imports, and no calls to external systems. The naming coincidence with a submodule is potentially confusing but does not indicate malicious intent. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a placeholder or stub function with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
