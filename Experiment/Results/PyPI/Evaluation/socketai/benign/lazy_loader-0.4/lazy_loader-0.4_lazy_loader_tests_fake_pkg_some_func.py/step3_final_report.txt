  "purpose": "This code defines a placeholder function named 'some_func' with no implementation, serving as a stub or template.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the function does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the function performs no operations or data transfers.",
  "anomalies": "The function shares its name with a submodule, which could cause namespace conflicts but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, empty function with a docstring, with no external calls, data handling, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The naming conflict is noted but not security-related. Scores of malware, obfuscated, and security risk are appropriately zero, with high confidence. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign placeholder with no malicious intent or security concerns. The reports are accurate, and their scoring is consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
