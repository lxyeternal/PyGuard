  "purpose": "Define a placeholder function named 'some_func' with no implementation.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling points.",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing occurs within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The function has the same name as a submodule, which might be a naming conflict but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single function definition with no implementation. The docstring notes that the function shares its name with a submodule, possibly indicating an intent to shadow or override a module name, but this alone is not malicious. No external data sources, sinks, or complex control flows are present. The code appears benign and simple, serving as a placeholder or stub.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The naming of the function could potentially cause conflicts or confusion but does not constitute malicious activity.",
