  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for lazy loading modules and attributes, including delayed import error handling and stub file parsing for static analysis.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., 'EAGER_IMPORT'), sys.modules, importlib, importlib.util, sys._getframe, file system (stub files), stack frames.",
  "sinks": "importlib.import_module, sys.modules, getattr, raising AttributeError, raising ModuleNotFoundError, warnings.warn, exceptions.",
  "flows": "Environment variable check triggers eager import; __getattr__ triggers import of modules or attributes; delayed import errors raise upon attribute access; stub file parsing influences attach_stub's submodule/attribute setup.",
  "anomalies": "Use of delayed import error modules to hide import failures; environment variable 'EAGER_IMPORT' to control eager loading; external stub files parsed for static analysis, which could be tampered with but are not malicious themselves.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Python techniques for lazy loading, delayed error reporting, and static analysis support. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The use of threading.Lock, importlib, sys.modules, and environment variables is typical. Delayed import errors and stub parsing are known patterns that can be misused if external inputs are malicious, but the code itself remains benign. The overall structure and logic are clear and consistent with legitimate utility libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured utility for lazy module loading and static analysis support. There are no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The primary risks relate to external stub files and potential misuse of dynamic import patterns, but these are standard practices and do not indicate malicious intent.",
