  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code's behavior, and assess the potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Utility functions for lazy loading, delayed import errors, stub parsing.\n- Key observations: Uses standard library modules; no malicious code; employs common patterns; no obfuscation.\n- Malware score: 0; Confidence: 0.9.\n- Justification: The code's purpose aligns with typical lazy-loading utilities; no malicious activity or obfuscation detected.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly identifies that the code is a legitimate utility for lazy loading modules, with no signs of malicious intent. The delayed error reporting via `DelayedImportErrorModule` is a known pattern. The use of environment variables for eager import is standard and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Similar lazy-loading with focus on dynamic import and error handling.\n- Key observations: Dynamic imports, environment variables, potential to mask malicious modules, delayed errors.\n- Malware score: 0; Confidence: 0.8.\n- Justification: While lazy loading and delayed errors can hide issues, there's no evidence of malicious payloads. The patterns are standard.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report reasonably notes that the pattern of lazy loading and error suppression could be exploited if malicious modules are introduced, but the code itself is benign. The use of warnings and delayed errors is common in such utilities.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Lazy loading, stub parsing, optional dependencies.\n- Key observations: Uses standard importlib functions, cautious about external stub files, no malicious code.\n- Malware score: 0; Confidence: 0.9.\n- Justification: The code relies on external stub files, which could be a vector if tampered with, but the code's logic is standard and safe.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly emphasizes that external stub files could be a risk if malicious, but the code's core logic is straightforward and does not contain malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Lazy loading, static type support, stub parsing.\n- Key observations: External stub files, dynamic imports, potential risks if stub files are malicious.\n- Malware score: 0; Confidence: 0.9.\n- Justification: The code's reliance on external files could be exploited, but the code itself is benign.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report accurately notes that stub file parsing could be a risk if stub files are malicious, but the code's implementation is standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- Purpose: Lazy loading, static analysis support.\n- Key observations: Uses standard modules, no malicious activity, minimal security risk.\n- Malware score: 0; Confidence: 0.9.\n- Justification: No signs of malicious behavior; the code is a typical utility.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report correctly states that the code is a benign utility for lazy loading with minimal security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, and the code does not contain any malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as the code is clear and well-structured.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low, primarily related to potential misuse of dynamic imports or stub files, but not malicious.\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malicious intent or payload detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — minimal, mostly due to external stub file parsing and dynamic import patterns that could be exploited if misused.\n\nThis code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured utility for lazy module loading, with no signs of malicious activity. Its design is consistent with common patterns in Python package development aimed at improving import efficiency and handling optional dependencies gracefully.",
