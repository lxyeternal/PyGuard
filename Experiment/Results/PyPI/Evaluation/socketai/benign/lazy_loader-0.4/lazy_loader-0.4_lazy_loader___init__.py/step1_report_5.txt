  "anomalies": [
    "The code dynamically imports modules and attributes without sanitization, but this is expected behavior for lazy loading utilities.",
    "Use of os.environ.get('EAGER_IMPORT') to trigger eager import, which could lead to unintended loading of modules, but not malicious.",
    "Potential warning about subpackage eager loading when using load(), but no malicious intent implied.",
    "No suspicious or malicious code like network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present.",
    "No code obfuscation or hidden malicious patterns detected.",
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides mechanisms for lazy loading modules, submodules, and attributes, and for loading modules on demand via proxies, with support for static type stub integration. It uses standard importlib and sys modules for dynamic imports and module management. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of environment variables to trigger eager imports is a common pattern and does not suggest malicious intent. The module also includes a specialized class for delayed import errors to provide informative error messages. The overall structure is consistent with safe, utility-oriented code for module lazy loading.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility package for lazy and on-demand module loading, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It employs standard Python practices and does not contain any suspicious or harmful patterns. Its security risk is minimal, primarily related to the potential for misuse of dynamic imports if used improperly, but not malicious in itself.",
