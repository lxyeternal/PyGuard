  "conclusion": "The code pattern is consistent with benign lazy-loading practices, with some minor suspicion due to threading and delays. There is no evidence of malicious activity or data exfiltration. The main uncertainty lies in the behavior of the external 'lazy_loader' module. The malware score should remain low (around 0.1), obfuscated score slightly above zero (around 0.2), and overall security risk low (~0.2-0.3). The pattern is typical for lazy-loading, and without further malicious indicators, it is considered safe but warrants cautious monitoring."
