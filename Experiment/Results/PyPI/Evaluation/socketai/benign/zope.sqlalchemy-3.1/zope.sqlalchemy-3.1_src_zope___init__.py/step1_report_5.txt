{
  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package to allow for multiple distributions of the same namespace.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' leads to namespace declaration; no data flow or external data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and uses a common namespace declaration pattern; no anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls 'declare_namespace(__name__)', which is a standard pattern for defining namespace packages in Python. This pattern is used to enable multiple distributions to contribute to the same namespace. The code is very minimal and does not perform any data processing, network activity, or dynamic execution. There are no signs of malicious behavior or anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard namespace declaration for Python packages and does not contain any malicious behavior or security issues. It serves to set up namespace packaging and is common in open-source projects.",
