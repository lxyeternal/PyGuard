{
  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package to support multiple distributions sharing the same namespace.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' dynamically via __import__ and calls declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code performs a standard namespace declaration without external data handling.",
  "flows": "Import of 'pkg_resources' -> call to declare_namespace(__name__) with no external data flow or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a minimal, standard namespace declaration with no obfuscation, secrets, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code uses a common pattern for namespace packages in Python, importing 'pkg_resources' dynamically and declaring the namespace. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscation. The code is straightforward and aligns with standard packaging practices. Scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate and justified based on the code's simplicity and benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard namespace declaration with no security risks or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and no modifications are necessary.",
