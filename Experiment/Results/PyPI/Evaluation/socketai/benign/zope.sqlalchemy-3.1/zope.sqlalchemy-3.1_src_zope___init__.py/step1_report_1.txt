  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted data or external systems are present.",
  "flows": "Importing 'pkg_resources' and declaring the namespace does not involve data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares the current package as a namespace package with 'declare_namespace'. This is a common pattern used in Python packaging to support namespace packages, especially in distributed environments. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity is evident. The code is standard and simple, with no obfuscated elements or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace declaration for Python packaging. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
