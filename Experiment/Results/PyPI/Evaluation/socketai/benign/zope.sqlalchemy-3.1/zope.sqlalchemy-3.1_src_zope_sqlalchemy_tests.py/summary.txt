  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, open-source testing framework for SQLAlchemy ORM and transaction management. It contains no malware, sabotage, or obfuscation signals. The environment variable reliance is standard and does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The overall confidence in this assessment is high."
