  "purpose": "Crop a PNG image to a specified rectangular window, returning a new image instance.",
  "sources": "Reads image metadata ('size', 'planes') and pixel data ('rows') from the input image object.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; the function returns a new image object after processing.",
  "flows": "Input image data flows through boundary validation, index calculations, and row slicing to produce the cropped image.",
  "anomalies": "Uses 'raise NotImplementedError()' for boundary validation failures, which is unconventional; typically, 'ValueError' is preferred.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard image cropping by validating input coordinates, calculating slice indices considering 'planes', and yielding sliced rows. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The boundary validation is correct but could be improved by using more appropriate exceptions. The overall structure is straightforward and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented image cropping utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor issue is the choice of exception for boundary validation, which does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1).",
