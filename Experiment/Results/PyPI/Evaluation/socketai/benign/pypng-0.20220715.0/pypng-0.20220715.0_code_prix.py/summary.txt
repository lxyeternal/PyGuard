  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-implemented image cropping utility with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The only minor issue is the choice of exception for boundary validation, which does not impact security. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1)."
