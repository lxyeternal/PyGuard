{
  "purpose": "The code implements a PNG encoder and decoder in pure Python, supporting reading and writing PNG files with features like interlacing, transparency, gamma correction, palettes, and chunk validation.",
  "sources": "Reads PNG file signature, chunks (IHDR, PLTE, tRNS, gAMA, pHYs, etc.), image data (IDAT chunks), and input pixel data for encoding.",
  "sinks": "Writes PNG chunks (IHDR, PLTE, tRNS, IDAT, IEND) to output streams or files, including compressed image data and metadata chunks.",
  "flows": "Reads signature -> processes chunks -> decompresses IDAT data -> undo filters -> deinterlaces if needed -> outputs pixel rows; for writing, encodes pixel data -> applies filters -> compresses -> writes chunks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious routines, no network activity, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no backdoors, and no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly adheres to PNG specifications, with thorough validation of chunks, safe decompression, and pixel data handling. It contains no external communications or malicious behaviors. The implementation is transparent, well-structured, and documented. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscation score to 0, and security risk is minimal (~0.1), reflecting typical image processing risks without active vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, open-source PNG processing library with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. It is safe for use in production and open-source projects.",
