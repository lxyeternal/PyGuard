{
  "purpose": "Render input text as a PNG image using a predefined font bitmap.",
  "sources": "Input text is read from command line arguments or standard input.",
  "sinks": "Output PNG file written to disk; standard output used for PNG data stream.",
  "flows": "User input (argument or stdin) -> processed into raster image -> written to PNG file or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors observed. Font data is static, used solely for rendering. No network access or environment variable misuse. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a font bitmap and functions to convert text into a raster image. It handles input via command line or stdin and outputs a PNG image. No external network connections, no code injection, no data exfiltration, and no suspicious operations are present. Usage is straightforward: generate text image files. The font data is static and intended solely for rendering. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code appears purely for text-to-image rendering with no malicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign text-to-PNG rendering utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs its intended function securely without any suspicious features or malicious code.",
