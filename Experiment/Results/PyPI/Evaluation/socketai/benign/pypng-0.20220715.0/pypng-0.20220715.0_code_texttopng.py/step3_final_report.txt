  "purpose": "Render input text as a PNG image using a static bitmap font.",
  "sources": "Command-line argument or stdin for input text.",
  "sinks": "PNG file written to disk or stdout for image output.",
  "flows": "Input text is processed, converted into raster pixel data via font lookup, then written as PNG image.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; font data is static; no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility that converts text into a PNG image using predefined font bitmaps. It reads input from command-line or stdin, processes each character with static font data, and outputs a PNG image. There are no network calls, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. The font data is static and standard, and the code structure is clear and transparent. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The security risk is minimal, and malware scores are zero, aligning with the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward utility for rendering text as PNG images. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and securityRisk≈0 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
