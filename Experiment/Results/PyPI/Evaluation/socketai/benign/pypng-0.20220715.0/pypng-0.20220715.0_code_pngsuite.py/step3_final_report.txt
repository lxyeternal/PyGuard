It includes command-line options to list available images or output a specific image. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscation. The data is known test images from PngSuite, with no signs of malicious intent. The code's logic is simple and transparent, and the embedded data is static. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 or 0.1) are consistent with the benign, static nature of the code.\",\n  conclusion\": \"The code is a benign static data provider for PNG images, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal risk score (0.1) accounts for the potential misuse of outputting binary data, which is not malicious in itself. Overall, the script is safe and suitable for its intended purpose.\",\n  \"confidence\": 1,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.1\n}",
