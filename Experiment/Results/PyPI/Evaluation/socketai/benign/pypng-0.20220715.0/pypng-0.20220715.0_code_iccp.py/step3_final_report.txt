{
  "purpose": "The code handles ICC profile extraction from PNG images, parsing, encoding, and writing ICC profiles and tags according to ICC specifications.",
  "sources": "Reads PNG chunks (iCCP), decompresses profile data, reads ICC profile headers and tags.",
  "sinks": "Processes ICC profile data in memory; no external data sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Extracts profile from PNG -> decompresses -> parses ICC profile -> encodes/decodes tags -> writes profile back to file.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. Minor incomplete functions are non-malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code strictly implements ICC profile parsing, encoding, and PNG chunk handling using standard libraries and ICC specifications. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. Functions for reading, decoding, and writing profiles follow standard procedures. No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Minor syntax issues in placeholder functions do not impact security. The code's scope is limited to ICC profile management, with no suspicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate ICC profile utility for PNG images, with no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. It adheres to ICC standards and handles data securely. The security risk is minimal, and the malware and obfuscation scores are 0. The overall risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting its benign purpose.",
