{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to manipulate ICC profiles extracted from PNG images, allowing reading, decoding, creating, and writing ICC profile data, including custom tags.",
  "sources": "Reads data from PNG files (profileFromPNG), reads and decompresses ICC profile data from PNG chunks, reads input files, and accesses environment or command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Outputs ICC profile data to files or stdout, writes ICC profile headers and tag data to output streams.",
  "flows": "Input PNG data -> Extract ICC profile -> Parse and decode profile data -> Optionally modify or add tags -> Write ICC profile back to file or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Uses standard Python libraries for data parsing and compression. No hidden network communications or suspicious file modifications observed. The code appears well-structured for ICC profile processing without suspicious or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The script loads ICC profile data from PNG images, interprets and decodes various ICC profile tags, and provides options to extract or embed ICC profiles. All functions use standard libraries, and data handling appears consistent with ICC specifications. No signs of data leakage, network activity, or malicious code are present. The code does not perform any unauthorized system actions, nor does it contain backdoors or malware payloads. Its operations are limited to reading, parsing, and writing ICC profile data, with no suspicious side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate ICC profile handling tool with no detectable malicious behavior. It processes ICC profiles for image color management purposes without engaging in any harmful activities. Its design is consistent with standard profile manipulation utilities, and there are no indications of supply chain or malicious code issues.",
