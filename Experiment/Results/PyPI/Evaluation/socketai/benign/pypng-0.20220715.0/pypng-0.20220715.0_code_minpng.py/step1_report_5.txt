{
  "purpose": "The code generates a minimal 8-bit greyscale PNG image and writes it to an output stream.",
  "sources": "Reads image row data from the `rows` generator; reads image size from the `size` parameter.",
  "sinks": "Writes PNG binary data (headers, chunks, compressed image data) to the `out` stream.",
  "flows": "Reads `rows` and `size` to generate image data, then writes PNG signature, header, image data chunk, and end chunk to `out`.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data leaks. No use of environment variables or network operations. The code only processes image data and writes to a provided output stream.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal PNG writer that constructs a valid PNG file with only the essential chunks: signature, IHDR, IDAT, and IEND. It uses standard Python modules `struct` and `zlib` for packing data and compression, respectively. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or hidden backdoors. The code appears straightforward and intended for generating simple PNG images. No obfuscated code, suspicious patterns, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign PNG image generator with no signs of malicious intent. It performs straightforward image data processing and PNG file construction without any suspicious behavior or security risks.",
