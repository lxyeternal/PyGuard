  "purpose": "Generate a minimal 8-bit greyscale PNG image by writing PNG signature, header, compressed pixel data, and end chunk to an output stream.",
  "sources": "Pixel rows (`rows`) and image size (`size`) provided as input; PNG signature and chunk headers are hardcoded; pixel data is read from `rows`.",
  "sinks": "Writing PNG chunks to output stream (`out`), including data and CRC checksums.",
  "flows": "Input pixel data flows into buffer, compressed with zlib, then written into IDAT chunk; CRCs computed for chunks; output stream receives signature, chunks, and end marker.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or external network activity; checksum calculation and data handling are standard; code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a valid PNG image from provided pixel data, using standard libraries (`struct`, `zlib`). It writes PNG signature, IHDR chunk with image dimensions, compresses pixel data into IDAT chunk, and appends IEND chunk. CRCs are correctly calculated. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code is clear, minimal, and adheres to PNG specifications. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. The security risk is negligible; the only potential concern is lack of input validation, but this is typical for such image generation code and not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward PNG generator with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores from the reports are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and risk score is effectively 0. Minor variation in security risk score (0.1) is an overestimation; a score of 0 is more accurate.",
