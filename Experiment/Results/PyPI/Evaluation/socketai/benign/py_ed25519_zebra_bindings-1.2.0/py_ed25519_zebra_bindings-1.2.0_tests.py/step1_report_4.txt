  "purpose": "Unit tests for ED25519 key generation, signing, and verification using external libraries.",
  "sources": "bip39.bip39_to_mini_secret() for seed derivation; ed25519_zebra.ed_from_seed(), ed25519_zebra.ed_sign(), ed25519_zebra.ed_verify(), ed25519_zebra.ed_public_from_secret() for cryptographic operations.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic functions perform in-memory signing and verification; no network or file I/O; no untrusted data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Seed derivation from mnemonic → key generation → signing → verification; test inputs flow through these functions internally, with no external data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Code is straightforward, standard test code with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or unusual constructs; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unittests for cryptographic operations using external libraries. It derives seeds from mnemonic phrases, signs messages, and verifies signatures. Tests include invalid key length and invalid signature checks. No hardcoded sensitive data other than test vectors. No external data sources or sinks beyond standard cryptographic function calls. The code appears to serve as a testing suite rather than production or malicious code. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard unit testing script for cryptographic functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs in-memory cryptographic operations using trusted external libraries. No malicious or backdoor behavior identified.",
