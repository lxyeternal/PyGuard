  "purpose": "Unit tests for ED25519 cryptographic functions using bip39 seed generation and key operations.",
  "sources": "bip39.bip39_to_mini_secret() for seed generation, ed25519_zebra.ed_from_seed() for key derivation, ed25519_zebra.ed_sign() for signing, ed25519_zebra.ed_verify() for verification, bytes.fromhex() for setting test keys.",
  "sinks": "ed25519_zebra.ed_sign() and ed25519_zebra.ed_verify() functions which perform cryptographic operations; potential data leaks if misuse occurs.",
  "flows": "Seed generated via bip39 -> key derivation -> sign -> verify; static test data used for signature verification.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of test vectors; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious input handling. Tests are self-contained.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for cryptographic functions, verifying signing and verification with valid and invalid inputs. The seed is derived from a mnemonic phrase but is used only within the test context. No external data sources, network calls, or file I/O are present. The cryptographic functions are assumed to be standard and safe as implemented; no signs of malicious or backdoor code. No unusual code constructs, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign test suite for cryptographic functions, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It performs unit testing of signature creation and verification using well-known libraries and static test vectors.",
