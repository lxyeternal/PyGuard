  "purpose": "Unit tests for ED25519 cryptographic functions including key derivation, signing, and verification using static test vectors.",
  "sources": "Seed input from bip39.bip39_to_mini_secret, static test vectors for public keys and signatures.",
  "sinks": "No external data or network activity; all data processed in-memory within tests.",
  "flows": "Seed derivation -> key generation -> signing -> verification; no external or untrusted data flows outside test scope.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets beyond test vectors, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward test suite for cryptographic functions, relying on well-known libraries and static data. It performs no external communication, contains no obfuscated or malicious code, and handles errors appropriately. All signals indicate benign, standard cryptographic testing without security risks or malware. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the code's behavior and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-structured cryptographic test suite with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
