  "purpose": "Invoke the main entry point of a command-line interface (CLI) application.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .cli import console_script_entry_point' and the check for '__main__' to execute the entry point.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'console_script_entry_point()' which executes code imported from the 'cli' module.",
  "flows": "Import of 'console_script_entry_point' from the local 'cli' module, then execution if the script is run directly.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and typical for CLI entry points, with no suspicious operations or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function 'console_script_entry_point' from a local module 'cli' and executes it if the script is run as the main program. This pattern is standard for CLI applications to start their main process. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior. The code itself is straightforward and appears safe. However, without inspecting the 'cli' module, we cannot determine if the called function has malicious behavior, but based solely on this snippet, it is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical CLI entry point that delegates execution to a function in another module. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this snippet alone.",
