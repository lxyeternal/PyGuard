  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point to invoke a command-line interface (CLI) function from the 'cli' module.",
  "sources": "Importing 'console_script_entry_point' from the local 'cli' module.",
  "sinks": "Calling 'console_script_entry_point()' if the script is executed directly.",
  "flows": "When executed, the script imports 'console_script_entry_point' and calls it, passing control to the CLI function.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal and typical for CLI entry points. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script checks if it is run as the main module, then executes a function 'console_script_entry_point' from a local module 'cli'. There are no visible parameters, environment variables, or external data sources. The code is straightforward and common in CLI Python programs. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard CLI entry point, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected based on this fragment.",
