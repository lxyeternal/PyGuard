{
  "purpose": "The code serves as an entry point for a command-line interface, executing a function from a local module when run as a script.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import and the execution condition; no external input data is directly read.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'console_script_entry_point()', which is assumed to be a function that may perform CLI operations; potential sinks depend on that function's implementation.",
  "flows": "If run as a script, it imports and executes 'console_script_entry_point()' from the local 'cli' module.",
  "anomalies": "The code itself is minimal and standard for CLI entry points, with no suspicious or unusual constructs. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function from a local module and executes it when run directly. There are no suspicious code patterns, obfuscated elements, or malicious indicators. The security assessment of the overall behavior depends on 'console_script_entry_point()' implementation, which is not provided. The current code is a typical CLI entry point pattern.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard CLI bootstrap with no signs of malicious behavior. Its security risk is minimal, but the security posture depends on the implementation of 'console_script_entry_point()'. No malware or malicious intent is evident.",
