  "purpose": "Minimal CLI entry point that delegates execution to a function imported from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import of console_script_entry_point from the local cli module.",
  "sinks": "Execution of console_script_entry_point() when run as main, which could execute arbitrary code depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Source: import statement; flow: function call in __main__ block.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python CLI bootstrap pattern. It imports a function and executes it if the script is run directly. The security implications depend entirely on the implementation of console_script_entry_point() in the cli module, which is not provided. The code itself shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1), reflecting minimal inherent risk but acknowledging potential risk if the imported function is malicious. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI entry point with no inherent malicious behavior. The security risk is minimal and primarily depends on the implementation of the external function. The scores assigned are appropriate; no modifications are necessary based solely on this snippet.",
