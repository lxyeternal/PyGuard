  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools with SCM versioning.",
  "sources": "The line 'setup(use_scm_version=True)' reads configuration during package installation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The setup function is invoked with a configuration parameter, but no data flow from untrusted sources exists.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward and standard for Python packaging.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls its setup function with a specific parameter. The code is minimal and typical for a package setup script. It does not include any malicious code, obfuscated parts, or suspicious behavior. The use of 'use_scm_version=True' indicates version management via SCM (Source Control Management), which is standard practice. There are no hidden or unusual constructs, no hardcoded secrets, and no external network or data flow. The script is a common, benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python packaging script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
