{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, using setuptools to manage package installation and versioning.",
  "sources": "The code reads the package setup command and the use_scm_version parameter, which instructs setuptools to use SCM (Source Control Management) for versioning.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external data sinks, or output operations are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is straightforward: invoking setup() with a parameter; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The script is minimal, standard, and typical for package setup.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with use_scm_version=True, indicating it relies on SCM for versioning, which is a common practice. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors. The code is simple, clear, and adheres to typical package setup conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any malware or suspicious patterns.",
