  "purpose": "A command-line utility for inspecting and extracting RPM files, supporting listing, info display, and extraction with basic security checks.",
  "sources": "Reading RPM file from stdin or specified file, accessing RPM headers and members, reading file contents during extraction.",
  "sinks": "Writing extracted files to disk, printing RPM info and filenames, reading input data from stdin or files.",
  "flows": "Input RPM data → parsing headers/members → listing info or extracting files → writing files to specified directory.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or network activity detected. Path traversal checks are present but rely on string matching.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard RPM utility that performs listing, info display, and extraction with appropriate resource management. Path validation using 'startswith' mitigates directory traversal risks, though real path resolution could be more robust. No malicious or obfuscated code is present. The security measures are adequate for the functionality, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The code uses standard libraries and the rpmfile module, with no suspicious logic or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, well-implemented RPM handling utility with proper security checks. No malicious intent or obfuscation is detected. The low security risk score (around 0.2) is justified given the path validation measures. Overall, the code is safe and suitable for use in supply chain contexts.",
