  "purpose": "This script provides command-line utilities to list, display information, or extract contents from RPM package files.",
  "sources": "Reads input RPM file from a file or stdin, and reads RPM metadata and file contents via rpmfile library.",
  "sinks": "Writes extracted files to specified directory; prints filenames and RPM info to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input RPM data -> parsed by rpmfile -> list/info/extract operations -> outputs or files.",
  "anomalies": "Uses path validation with startswith() for directory traversal prevention; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The script carefully reads RPM files, lists contents, displays metadata, or extracts files based on command-line arguments. Input RPM data is read into memory, and safe path checks are performed during extraction to prevent directory traversal attacks. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or network activity. The code uses standard libraries and a third-party rpmfile library for RPM handling, with no suspicious dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate RPM utility tool with appropriate security measures during extraction. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. It is a safe and standard implementation for RPM file operations.",
