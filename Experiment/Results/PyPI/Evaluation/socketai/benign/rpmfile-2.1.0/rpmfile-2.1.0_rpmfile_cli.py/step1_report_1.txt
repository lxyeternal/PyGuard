  "purpose": "A command-line utility for inspecting and extracting RPM package files.",
  "sources": "Input RPM file from a file path or stdin; reading RPM headers and files within the RPM.",
  "sinks": "File writing when extracting RPM files; printing filenames and info to stdout.",
  "flows": "Input data (RPM file) flows into reading functions; extracted file data flows into file writes; header info flows into print statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Use of sys.stdin and file operations are standard. Path traversal checks are present to prevent extraction outside target directory. No suspicious network activity or malicious payloads evident.",
  "analysis": "The script reads RPM files from stdin or a specified file. It processes command-line arguments to list files, show info, or extract contents. Extraction involves reading RPM headers and files, with security measures like path traversal prevention. No untrusted external data sources or network activity are present. The code structure is straightforward, and all operations appear to serve legitimate package management functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a RPM package inspection and extraction utility with proper security checks against directory traversal. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified. It appears safe for use within its intended scope.",
