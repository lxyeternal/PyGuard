{
  "purpose": "The code parses and extracts headers from RPM package files, providing structured access to metadata and signature information.",
  "sources": "Reads from a file object, specifically the RPM file header, signature header, and associated binary data segments.",
  "sinks": "Uses struct unpacking, byte slicing, and string splitting to process binary data; these are data processing operations but do not directly cause security effects.",
  "flows": "Reads file header bytes -> verifies magic header -> unpacks header entries -> extracts data based on type -> combines signature and main headers.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. No use of external network connections, system modifications, or covert data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The script strictly handles binary RPM header parsing, extracting structured metadata and signature info. It performs data unpacking, byte operations, and string manipulations without executing external code, network calls, or sensitive data handling beyond reading local files. No obfuscated code or unusual constructs are present. The code is consistent with standard RPM header parsing routines, with clear functions and data extraction logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward RPM header parser with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is designed solely for reading and interpreting RPM package metadata. No malicious signals or vulnerabilities are evident.",
