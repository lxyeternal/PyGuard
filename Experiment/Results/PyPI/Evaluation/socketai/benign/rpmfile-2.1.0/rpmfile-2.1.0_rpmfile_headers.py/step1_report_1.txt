{
  "purpose": "This code parses RPM package headers to extract metadata and signature information, providing tools to read and interpret RPM header structures.",
  "sources": "File input via 'fileobj' in '_readheader' and 'get_headers', and data slices within the RPM file stored in 'store' variables.",
  "sinks": "Data processing functions like 'struct.unpack', 'extract_data', and 'hexlify' that interpret raw bytes, but do not directly output untrusted data to external systems.",
  "flows": "File data is read and verified for magic bytes, then parsed into header entries, which are converted into human-readable metadata; no untrusted data is sent outside the process.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code strictly performs data extraction and interpretation. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or network activity is present. The only unusual aspect is the strict parsing logic, but it is standard for binary file formats.",
  "analysis": "The script begins with standard imports and defines several constants for RPM tags. It contains functions to extract strings, arrays, binary data, and integers from a byte store based on metadata. The core functions '_readheader' and 'get_headers' read RPM headers by verifying the magic bytes, unpacking header entries, and extracting associated data. The 'main' function opens a specified file, reads its headers, and prints the extracted metadata. Throughout, the code performs standard binary parsing without any network activity, user input handling, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward RPM header parser with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is designed solely for extracting RPM package metadata and signatures. No malware, obfuscation, or supply chain attacks are evident.",
