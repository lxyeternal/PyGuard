{
  "purpose": "This script reads and parses RPM package headers from a given file, extracting metadata and signature information for inspection or processing.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a filename provided as a command-line argument and reads binary data from the file to parse headers and entries.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; data is processed and stored in local variables, with no untrusted data being output or transmitted.",
  "flows": "File input → _readheader and get_headers functions → extract_data and extract_* functions → header dictionaries → pprint output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or credential handling present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads binary RPM header structures, unpacks data using struct, and extracts string and integer data without any suspicious behavior. It performs standard file parsing operations with assertions and data extraction functions. No indication of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system disruption mechanisms. The code is straightforward RPM header parsing logic, following typical patterns for such tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a standard RPM header parser with no evidence of malicious or sabotage behavior. It processes RPM files to extract metadata, with no network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated code. The overall security risk is very low.",
