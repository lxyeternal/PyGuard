  "purpose": "Defines constants, magic numbers, and data types related to RPM package structure and metadata.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions and metadata declarations; no input/output or external data reads.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that process untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; static constant definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious patterns. The code appears to be configuration/constants without dynamic or malicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of constant definitions for RPM package metadata and magic numbers. It contains no input/output, no data processing, and no functions or runtime logic. It lacks any form of dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. The presence of a comment crediting an author and a GitHub URL does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is purely definitional, serving as constants and metadata references for RPM packages. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard configuration file.",
