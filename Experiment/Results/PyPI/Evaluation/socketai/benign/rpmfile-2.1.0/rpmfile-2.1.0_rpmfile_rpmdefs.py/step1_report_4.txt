  "purpose": "Define constants and data structures related to RPM package format, including magic numbers, signature tags, data types, and common RPM tags.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs; this is a static definitions module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only contains constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation present. The constants and definitions are standard for RPM package format.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions, magic numbers, tags, and data type enumerations for RPM packages. No input/output, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no sensitive data handling are present. The content appears to be standard, well-structured, and documented with no signs of malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of constants for RPM package processing, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any operations or contain hidden behaviors.",
