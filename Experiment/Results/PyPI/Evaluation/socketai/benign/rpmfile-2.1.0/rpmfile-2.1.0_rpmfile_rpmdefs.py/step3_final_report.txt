{
  "purpose": "Defines constants, magic numbers, tag identifiers, sizes, and data types related to RPM package format.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading; static constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward static constants with no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constant definitions for RPM package metadata, magic numbers, tag IDs, sizes, and data types. There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or dynamic code. No obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is typical for a configuration or constants module, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and purely definitional, posing no security threat or supply chain risk. All reports correctly identify its nature and assign appropriate scores.",
