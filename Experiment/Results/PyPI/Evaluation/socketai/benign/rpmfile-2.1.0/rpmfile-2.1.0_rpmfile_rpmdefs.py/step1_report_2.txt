  "purpose": "Define constants and metadata related to RPM package format, including magic numbers, tags, and data types.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; mainly constant definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing logic; only constant assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of constant definitions and metadata related to RPM package structures. There are no functions, input handling, or data processing that could introduce security issues. The presence of a GitHub URL suggests attribution but not malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or potentially malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of constant definitions for RPM package metadata. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious code, and no security risks. It appears to be part of a larger, legitimate project related to RPM packaging.",
