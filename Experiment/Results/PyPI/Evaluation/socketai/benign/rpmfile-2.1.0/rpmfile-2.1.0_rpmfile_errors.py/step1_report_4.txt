  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for RPM errors",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only code initialization",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output",
  "flows": "No data flow or data processing",
  "anomalies": "Code is a simple class definition with no unusual features or secrets",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class named RPMError that inherits from Python's Exception class. It contains no methods, attributes, or logic beyond the class declaration. There are no external inputs, no data flows, and no potentially malicious constructs. The code appears to be a straightforward and standard pattern for creating custom exceptions in Python.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class definition for a custom exception without any malicious behavior or security risks. It serves as a standard way to handle specific error conditions related to RPM but does not introduce any security concerns.",
