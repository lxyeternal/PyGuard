{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for RPM-related errors",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow, as there are no sources or sinks",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, contains only a class definition for an exception with no functional behavior or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom exception class 'RPMError' inheriting from Exception, with only a pass statement. There are no data inputs, outputs, or logic that could be exploited. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detectable. The code appears to be a standard practice for defining custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
