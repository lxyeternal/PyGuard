  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \nAll reports correctly identify that the code is merely a class definition for a custom exception (`RPMError`) inheriting from `Exception`. There are no data inputs, outputs, or logic, and no suspicious constructs or behaviors. The code is minimal and standard.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly note the absence of data flows, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation**:  \n- **Obfuscated Score (0)**: Correct, as the code is straightforward and not obfuscated.  \n- **Malware Score (0)**: Correct, as there is no malicious activity or behavior.  \n- **Security Risk Score (0)**: Correct, given the benign nature of the code.  \n- **Confidence (1)**: Justified, as all reports agree and the code is simple.  \n\n4. **Justification for Any Higher Risk Scores**:  \nSince the code is purely a class definition with no data handling, external interactions, or suspicious patterns, raising the risk, malware, or obfuscated scores would be unjustified.\n\n5. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \nAll reports avoid assumptions and correctly interpret the code as benign. No unwarranted claims are made.\n\n6. **Consistency of Scores**:  \nScores are consistent across reports and with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThe code is a standard, harmless class definition for custom exception handling, with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThis code is a straightforward class definition with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The reports are accurate and consistent. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final recommendation**:  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0",
