  "purpose": "The code defines a custom exception class RPMError inheriting from Exception, serving as a simple, benign exception placeholder.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code contains only a class definition with no input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process or output data, nor does it interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the class contains only a pass statement with no logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward, with no suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard pattern for defining a custom exception in Python. It contains no malicious or security-related logic. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0, with full confidence. No issues, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code's simplicity and lack of external interactions confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard custom exception class with no security risks or malicious intent. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
