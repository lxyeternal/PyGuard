  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code is a minimal class definition for `RPMError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, logic, or external interactions.\n   - All reports correctly identify that this is a benign, standard pattern for custom exceptions.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment.\n   - They correctly note the absence of suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n   - No logical errors or misleading conclusions are evident.\n\n3. **Scores and Their Reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence that the assessment is correct)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware detected)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n   - No adjustments needed.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - The highest risk score assigned is 0, which is justified.\n   - The code is purely a class definition with no potential for harm.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain suspicious patterns.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They recognize the code as a standard, harmless pattern.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n   - No discrepancies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n### Overall Justification:\nThe code is a straightforward, minimal class definition for a custom exception, typical in Python projects. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious behavior, nor does it pose a security risk.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n- The scores are appropriate.\n- No further changes are necessary.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis provided.",
