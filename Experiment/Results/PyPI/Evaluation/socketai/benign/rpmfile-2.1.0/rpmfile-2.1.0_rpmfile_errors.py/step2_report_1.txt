  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Functionality**:\n   - The code defines a single class `RPMError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n   - It contains only a `pass` statement.\n   - There are no data inputs, outputs, external interactions, or logic.\n\n2. **Presence of Issues**:\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is minimal, straightforward, and serves as a custom exception class.\n   - No suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present.\n   - No data flows, sources, or sinks are involved.\n\n3. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n   - They correctly note the absence of security risks, malware, or anomalies.\n   - No logical errors or flawed reasoning are evident.\n\n4. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (full confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated)\n     - `malware`: 0 (no malware)\n     - `securityRisk`: 0 (no security risk)\n   - These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and benign nature.\n\n5. **Potential Vulnerabilities or Assumptions**:\n   - The code is purely a class definition with no operational logic, so there's no basis for assuming vulnerabilities.\n   - The reports do not overstate or understate the risk; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:\n   - The code is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n   - No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns are evident.\n   - The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n**My own estimates**:\n- **Malware score**: 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated score**: 0 (not obfuscated)\n- **Risk score**: 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Final notes**:\n- Since the code is a simple class definition with no operational content, there is no reason to assign any higher scores.\n- The reports are accurate and comprehensive.\n\n**Summary**:\nThe code is benign, standard, and carries no security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate. No changes are necessary.",
