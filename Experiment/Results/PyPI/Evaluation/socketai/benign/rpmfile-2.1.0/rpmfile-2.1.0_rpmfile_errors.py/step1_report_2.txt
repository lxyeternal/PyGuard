  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for RPM-related errors.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources used.",
  "sinks": "No data output, network, or system calls.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink as there are no input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious or unusual constructs, no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single custom exception class declaration without any logic, data handling, or external interactions. It appears to be a straightforward class definition, typical for custom error handling in Python projects. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The code is simple and adheres to standard conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves as a custom exception class for RPM errors. There are no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
