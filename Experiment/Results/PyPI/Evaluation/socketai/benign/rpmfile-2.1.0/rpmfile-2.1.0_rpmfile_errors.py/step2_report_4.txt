  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The code consists solely of a class definition for `RPMError` inheriting from `Exception`, with no methods, attributes, or logic.\n   - No data sources, sinks, or flows are present.\n   - The code is minimal and follows standard Python practices for defining custom exceptions.\n   - **Conclusion:** There are no issues, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behaviors in the code itself.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports uniformly describe the code as benign, straightforward, and standard.\n   - They mention no anomalies, no obfuscation, no secrets, and no malicious patterns.\n   - The analysis and conclusions are consistent across reports.\n   - **Note:** The reports are accurate; no errors or flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - confidence: 1\n     - obfuscated: 0\n     - malware: 0\n     - securityRisk: 0\n   - These scores are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - **Suggestion:** The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports indicate no malicious behavior, no vulnerabilities, and no obfuscation, the risk scores are correctly set to 0.\n   - **Therefore:** No adjustment needed.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - All reports assign malware = 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n   - **Confirmed:** No malware is present or suspected.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they correctly interpret the code as a simple class definition.\n   - No overreach or speculative claims are present.\n\n7. **Consistency of Scores:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n- The code is a straightforward, benign class definition.\n- The reports are accurate and appropriately scored.\n- No modifications to the scores or conclusions are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code poses no security risk, contains no malware, and is not obfuscated. It is a standard pattern for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n\n**Summary:** The code is safe, and the reports correctly reflect this.",
