  "review": "Let's review each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The code defines a single class `RPMError` inheriting from `Exception`.\n- The class contains only a `pass` statement.\n- There are no data sources, sinks, flows, or logic.\n- The code is minimal and appears to be a standard custom exception class.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Issues in the Code:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  The code does not contain any functional logic, data handling, or suspicious constructs. It is a straightforward class definition.  \n  **Conclusion:** No issues are present.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of Each Report:\nAll reports consistently state that the code is a simple class definition for a custom exception with no suspicious behavior. They mention:\n- No data sources or sinks.\n- No data flows.\n- No anomalies, secrets, or obfuscation.\n- No malicious or security risks.\n\n**Logical flaws or mistakes:**  \n- The reports correctly identify that the code is benign and standard.\n\n**Are their conclusions reasonable?**  \n- Yes. The code is minimal and standard for defining custom exceptions in Python.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Their Justification:\n- **Confidence:** All reports give a confidence of 1, which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Security Risk:** All reports assign 0, which is correct.\n\n**Are the scores reasonable?**  \n- Yes, the scores align with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging Claims and Assumptions:\n- The reports assume that because the code is a simple class definition, it cannot be malicious or risky. This is valid, as the code does not perform any operations, data handling, or external interactions.\n- No assumptions about potential vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Overall Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0  \n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The code is a straightforward, standard exception class with no malicious or suspicious features.  \n- No vulnerabilities or security risks are present based on this code snippet.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- **Confirmed issues:** None.\n- **Errors or flaws in reports:** None; all reports correctly identify the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** All are appropriate; no adjustments needed.\n- **Final estimate:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is benign and poses no security threat.",
