  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution signs. While no definitive malicious payload is confirmed, the traits warrant a malware score of 0.5, obfuscation score of 0.7, and a moderate security risk (~0.4). The other reports are benign and appropriately scored. Continued analysis is recommended for report 5 to confirm malicious activity."
