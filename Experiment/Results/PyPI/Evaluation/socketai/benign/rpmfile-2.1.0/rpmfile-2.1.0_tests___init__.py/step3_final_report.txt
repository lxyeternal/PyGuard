  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network connections, file reads, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, system commands, dynamic code execution points, data exfiltration channels.",
  "flows": "Sources (env vars, network, files) through obfuscated or dynamic code to sinks (network, system commands).",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation (high obfuscation score), dynamic code execution (eval/exec), complex control flow, potential data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent. The presence of network activity and complex control flow further raises suspicion. No explicit hardcoded secrets or payloads are confirmed, but the suspicious traits justify cautious scoring. Benign reports show standard imports and no anomalies. The scores reflect these observations, with higher suspicion in report 5 due to obfuscation and dynamic code features.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution signs. While no definitive malicious payload is confirmed, the traits warrant a malware score of 0.5, obfuscation score of 0.7, and a moderate security risk (~0.4). The other reports are benign and appropriately scored. Continued analysis is recommended for report 5 to confirm malicious activity.",
