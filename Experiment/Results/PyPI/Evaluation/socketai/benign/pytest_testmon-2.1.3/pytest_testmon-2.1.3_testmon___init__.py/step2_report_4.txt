  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine if the conclusions and scores are appropriate.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All code snippets are simple variable assignments with a comment indicating 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE'.\n- No external inputs, data flows, or sinks are present.\n- The comments are likely directives for pytest, not malicious code.\n- No obfuscation, malware, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Summary:** Benign; simple assignment, comment for pytest.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Notes:** No issues detected.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Summary:** Also benign; straightforward constant with a pytest directive comment.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Notes:** No concerns.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Summary:** Same as above; simple version constant with a pytest comment.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Notes:** No issues.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Summary:** Similar benign code, just a version string with a comment.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Notes:** No concerns.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Summary:** Same pattern; version string with a comment.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Notes:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- The presence of the comment 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' is a testing directive, not an attack vector.\n- The malware score is correctly zero across all reports.\n- The security risk score is appropriately zero.\n- Obfuscation is correctly identified as absent.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The scores assigned in all reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- The reasoning in each report is sound, with no assumptions of vulnerabilities unsupported by evidence.\n- The code snippets are trivial and serve as configuration or version markers.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimates:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0, no security risks detected.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate and appropriately scored. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky elements. The scoring aligns with the code's simplicity and intent.",
