  "purpose": "Defines a version string for testing purposes with a pytest directive comment to prevent rewriting.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static assignment of TESTMON_VERSION; comment as a directive.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or untrusted input/output.",
  "flows": "N/A; static code with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Comment 'PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE' indicating pytest behavior; no malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a version string with a comment intended as a pytest directive. No external inputs, data flows, or dynamic code execution are present. The comment does not execute or introduce security risks. The version string is static and harmless. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, serving as a configuration or version marker with a pytest directive comment. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustment is necessary.",
